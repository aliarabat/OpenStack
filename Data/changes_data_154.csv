Currently create_user is just inherited from CredsClient and, therefore,
does not pass a domain_id to the /v3/users POST API call to create a new
user. As a result a domain with id ""default"" is used as no domain is
explicitly passed in the API call which results in 404 NOT FOUND and the
following error: ""Could not find domain: default."".

The right way is passing a domain from:

1) CONF.auth.admin_domain_name
2) CONF.auth.default_credentials_domain_name

This is already taken into account when a domain_name is passed from
identity_utils during object instantiation and used for in the
create_project method specific to V3CredsClient. The API calls only
accept a domain_id which is why creds_domain field of a V3CredsClient
object is used to store an id of a domain_name domain passed via
constructor. The same can be used for create_user method specific to v3.

This commit updates the DDT protection tests with addition cases so that
we can test the new personas we're adding. It renames the existing tests
to use the term 'legacy', in hopes that it's more descriptive of the
fact it's testing old authorization behavior.

This commit also updates the test utility methods to provide
system-specific context objects and wraps the existing dummy_context()
method.

And the changes necessary to make the new personas work.

Commit eeeca4ceff (Handle disabled CPU features to fix live migration
failures, 2020-10-06) literally drops every CPU flag entry from guest
XML that had policy=""disable"".  I noticed this while testing this
patch[1] that allows disabling CPU flags, where disabled CPU flags are
altogether dropped from the guest XML record.  We should retain them.

The bug[2] the above-mentioned commit was putting a band-aid to -- which
is to ignore disabled CPU flags when computing a baseline CPU, to allow
live migration on some Intel processors -- would've been addressed by
half of the original patch.  That is, in the class LibvirtConfigCPU(),
we can drop the check from the parse_dom(), but keep it in format_dom().
Effectively, this is a partial revert of the said commit (eeeca4ceff).

Example:  In both the below cases, I'm testing with this patch that
allows disabling CPU flags[1].  Test: In `[libvirt]cpu_model_flags`,
enable ""md-clear"" and ""pcid"", but disable ""mtrr"" and ""pdpe1gb"".

Result without this patch
-------------------------

  <cpu mode='custom' match='exact' check='full'>
    <model fallback='forbid'>Nehalem-IBRS</model>
    <feature policy='require' name='md-clear'/>
    <feature policy='require' name='pcid'/>
  </cpu>

Only the enabled flags are shown for the guest.

Result with this patch
----------------------

  <cpu mode='custom' match='exact' check='full'>
    <model fallback='forbid'>Nehalem-IBRS</model>
    <feature policy='require' name='md-clear'/>
    <feature policy='require' name='pcid'/>
    <feature policy='disable' name='mtrr'/>
    <feature policy='disable' name='pdpe1gb'/>
  </cpu>

Here we see both enabled _and_ disabled flags in the guest XML, which is
much clearer.  So go with this approach.

Adding constraints support to libraries is slightly more
complex than services as the libraries themselves are listed
in upper-constraints.txt which leads to errors that you can't
install a specific version and a constrained version.

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper
script to edit the constraints to remove barbican-tempest-plugin.

that Podman is configured correctly. Then it ensures that

- Increment retries: waiting 20 seconds (i.e., 10 retries) seem to
  be not enough for monasca-grafana to start on the first node.
  Increasing to 80 seconds (i.e., 40 retries) fixes the issue.

- Prevent the check from running when kolla_action=config. In that
  case, the command would never succeed as the service is not
  deployed yet (similarly to
  https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/kolla-ansible/+/771237).

If kolla-ansible is installed via pip install --user, currently the
kolla-ansible script is unable to locate the installed playbooks.
This leads to a failure when running commands.

This change fixes the issue by checking for the user's .local directory
as a possible installation path.

This fixes some of the scenario tests which were failing after switching
to a user installation in Ifaf1948ed5d42eebaa62d7bad375bbfc12b134d5.

If kolla-ansible is installed via pip install --user, currently the
kolla-ansible script is unable to locate the installed playbooks.
This leads to a failure when running commands.

This change fixes the issue by checking for the user's .local directory
as a possible installation path.

It was earlier possible to override network config
for undercloud with a custom config using
``net_config_override`` in undercloud.conf or with
``UndercloudNetConfigOverride`` parameter. Though it's
now possible to change ``UndercloudNetworkConfigTemplate``
parameter to override the default config, we probably
still need to support``net_config_override`` and
``UndercloudNetConfigOverride`` for backward compatibility.

This reverts commit b544e914945051255f87d95c5e91898fd21605a1.

This work-around for very early dnf is now causing other problems
building with RHEL images [1].  It's likely that the bug talked about
in the original change where packages were removed despite being
explicitly installed is no longer an issue.  I think we can revert
this now.

DSVM recently got a bunch more middlewares enabled, so it's running more
tests than it used to.

I can't think of much that's changed for probe tests, but I feel like
I've seen it popping timeouts more often lately.

Note that the new timeouts are still lower than the typical run-time of
our longest-running jobs (currently grenade / tempest-ipv6-only).

There are a few issues fixed here:

- The Barbican API service doesn't set a log file, so all the Barbican API
  service logs go to loadwsgi.py.log by default.
- The logs in loadwsgi.py.log are not ingested properly by Fluentd.
- uWSGI logs go to barbican-api.log. This would normally be used as the log
  file for the Barbican API service logs.

This patch makes the following changes to address the above issues:

- All uWSGI logs (from the Emperor and Vassals) go to barbican_api_uwsgi_access.log
  Although these logs aren't strictly all access logs, this follows the existing
  pattern for WSGI logs.
- The Barbican API service logs are written to barbican-api.log instead of
  loadwsgi.py.log. This follows the pattern used by other OpenStack services.
- Fluentd is configured to parse the Barbican API service logs as it would with
  other OpenStack Python services.

md5 is not an approved algorithm in FIPS mode, and trying to
instantiate a hashlib.md5() will fail when the system is running in
FIPS mode.

md5 is allowed when in a non-security context.  There is a plan to
add a keyword parameter (usedforsecurity) to hashlib.md5() to annotate
whether or not the instance is being used in a security context.

In the case where it is not, the instantiation of md5 will be allowed.
See https://bugs.python.org/issue9216 for more details.

Some downstream python versions already support this parameter.  To
support these versions, a new encapsulation of md5() is added to
openstack/utils.py.  This encapsulation is identical to the one being
added to oslo.utils, but is recreated here to avoid adding a dependency.

This patch is to replace the instances of hashlib.md5() with this new
encapsulation, adding an annotation indicating whether the usage is
a security context or not.

When an operator does a `find_and_replace` on a DB that already has
shard ranges, they get a prompt like:

   This will delete existing 58 shard ranges.
   Do you want to show the existing ranges [s], delete the existing
   ranges [yes] or quit without deleting [q]?

Previously, if they selected `q`, we would skip the delete but still do
the merge (!) and immediately warn about how there are now invalid shard
ranges. Now, quit without merging.

Previously, if you were on Python 2.7.10+ [0], such a newline would cause the
sharder to fail, complaining about invalid header values when trying to create
the shard containers. On older versions of Python, it would most likely cause a
parsing error in the container-server that was trying to handle the PUT.

Now, quote all places that we pass around container paths. This includes:

  * The X-Container-Sysmeta-Shard-(Quoted-)Root sent when creating the (empty)
    remote shards
  * The X-Container-Sysmeta-Shard-(Quoted-)Root included when initializing the
    local handoff for cleaving
  * The X-Backend-(Quoted-)Container-Path the proxy sends to the object-server
    for container updates
  * The Location header the container-server sends to the object-updater

Note that a new header was required in requests so that servers would
know whether the value should be unquoted or not. We can get away with
reusing Location in responses by having clients opt-in to quoting with
a new X-Backend-Accept-Quoted-Location header.

During a rolling upgrade,

  * old object-servers servicing requests from new proxy-servers will
    not know about the container path override and so will try to update
    the root container,
  * in general, object updates are more likely to land in the root
    container; the sharder will deal with them as misplaced objects, and
  * shard containers created by new code on servers running old code
    will think they are root containers until the server is running new
    code, too; during this time they'll fail the sharder audit and report
    stats to their account, but both of these should get cleared up upon
    upgrade.

Drive-by: fix a ""conainer_name"" typo that prevented us from testing that
we can shard a container with unicode in its name. Also, add more UTF8
probe tests.

At present, the collection and compression of static file is
carried out asynchronously to speed up execution. If compression
starts before collection has completed it can result in incomplete
results which cause the Horizon front end to produce 500 errors.

This patch switches the collection of static files back to a
synchronous task before triggering the slower compression as an
asynchronous task to maintain most of the speed-up benefit.

Installing kolla-ansible system-wide on CentOS 8 fails with:

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'setuptools_rust'

This error appeared following the release of cryptography 3.4, which now
includes Rust code. It can be installed without Rust using a Python
wheel, but only with more recent pip than version 9.0.3 available as RPM
on CentOS 8. The cryptography bug report [1] recommends pip>=19.1.1.

This change switches to using pip --user when installing kolla-ansible.

Also fixes an issue with ansible-lint which was failing on
etc/kolla/globals.yml due to a missing space before comments.

This Victoria backport also includes
I47473de6f71c422db2238d653c2d8f379c55e79b, which fixes a similar issue
with ceph-ansible.

Several foundation channels have moved to new names and the old ones
have been set private to ensure new joins get correctly forwarded.
Unfortunately this means that our check access script is unable to
correctly determine permissions as it does not use a privileged

when trying to perform an access list call on each of them. Remove
these channels so we'll stop blocking merge of unrelated changes in

When processing port events (create, update, delete), the port
provisioning (port creation) has priority over the other events [1].
As reported in the related bug, if a port deletion with an IP
address and another port creation with the same IP address arrive
to the DHCP agent, those events can be processed in the same queue.

Because of the creation event priority, even when this event arrived
after the deletion event, it will be processed first. That will
clash with the DHCP agent cache, that contains a port (not deleted
yet) with the same IP address. That will trigger an unwanted resync.

This patch implements a specific logic to store the events in
""ResourceProcessingQueue"" (that uses ""PriorityQueue"" [2]). When
a port event arrives, the event comparison method checks the
(subnet, fixed_ips) tuple set of both elements. If there is a
coincidence, that means those ports are the same or are using
the same IP addreses (the race condition explained in the bug).
In this case, the priority is defined only by the timestamp;
that means the events are processed in order of arrival.

Because the Neutron server do not allow to have two ports in the
same subnet with the same IP address, the order of the events is
guaranteed. In the case explained in the bug, the deletion event
will be processed first.

Prior to oslo.policy version 3.6.2, the Enforcer() object would load and
update the deprecated rules for a check regardless of it already being
done.

A recent change to oslo.policy updated the Enforcer() to be smarter
about this case and it was released in oslo.policy version 3.6.2:

  https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/oslo.policy/+/773414

This became prevalent in neutron's usage of deprecated rules to update
their policies for secure RBAC personas since the Enforcer() object is
used extensively for APIs, resource, and attribute protection.

This should restore neutron's API performance to what it was prior to
the mass deprecation default policy rules.

There are a few issues fixed here:

- The Barbican API service doesn't set a log file, so all the Barbican API
  service logs go to loadwsgi.py.log by default.
- The logs in loadwsgi.py.log are not ingested properly by Fluentd.
- uWSGI logs go to barbican-api.log. This would normally be used as the log
  file for the Barbican API service logs.

This patch makes the following changes to address the above issues:

- All uWSGI logs (from the Emperor and Vassals) go to barbican_api_uwsgi_access.log
  Although these logs aren't strictly all access logs, this follows the existing
  pattern for WSGI logs.
- The Barbican API service logs are written to barbican-api.log instead of
  loadwsgi.py.log. This follows the pattern used by other OpenStack services.
- Fluentd is configured to parse the Barbican API service logs as it would with
  other OpenStack Python services.

Deploy a small cloud. Add one host to the compute group in the
inventory, and scale out:

$ kolla-ansible deploy --limit <new compute host>

The command succeeds, but creating an instance fails with the following:

    Host 'compute0' is not mapped to any cell

This happens because we only discover computes on the first host in the
cell's nova conductor group. If that host is not in the specified limit,
the discovery will not happen.

This change fixes the issue by running compute discovery when any ironic
or virtualised compute hosts are in the play batch, and delegating it to
a conductor.

At present, the collection and compression of static file is
carried out asynchronously to speed up execution. If compression
starts before collection has completed it can result in incomplete
results which cause the Horizon front end to produce 500 errors.

This patch switches the collection of static files back to a
synchronous task before triggering the slower compression as an
asynchronous task to maintain most of the speed-up benefit.

If kolla-ansible is installed via pip install --user, currently the
kolla-ansible script is unable to locate the installed playbooks.
This leads to a failure when running commands.

This change fixes the issue by checking for the user's .local directory
as a possible installation path.

This fixes some of the scenario tests which were failing after switching
to a user installation in Ifaf1948ed5d42eebaa62d7bad375bbfc12b134d5.
Most tests did not fail since the kolla-ansible script in the source
checkout was used.

Starting With podman 2.X the default pids-limits has been halved from
4096 to 2048:
$ rpm -q podman && podman run --rm -it --net=host --name 'pids' edecd409281d sh -c 'cat /sys/fs/cgroup/pids/pids.max'
podman-2.2.1-3.module+el8.3.1+9392+c5f6d096.x86_64
2048

With podman-1.6.4 the global default pid-limits was hardcoded to 4096
and we had no way to tweak it.

With podman 2.X it is possible to override this in
/etc/containers/containers.conf with the pids_limit setting inside
[containers] in the /etc/containers/containers.conf ini-file:
$ cat /etc/containers/containers.conf
[containers]
pids_limit=6666

$ podman run --rm -it --net=host --name 'pids' edecd409281d sh -c 'cat /sys/fs/cgroup/pids/pids.max'
6666

By adding this we keep the older 4096 default so we do not regress and
at the same time we allow an operator to override this globally.

During update/upgrade/scale, already deployed node should
not be rebooted, if the kernel args are changed. Reboot of
the node should be planned by the user with migration and
downtime window. With this change, the kernel args will be
updated to the already deployed node, but it will not be
applied with reboot. For fresh nodes, where kernel args
entry is not found, the reboot will be applied.

In case, when the existing node is deployed without kernel
args but during an update the kernel args are added. At this
time a reboot is required, because there are other services
which depends on the kernel args like hugepages for OvS-DPDK
and iommu for SR-IOV.

It leaves with another edge case, when the node is deployed
with only SR-IOV and OvS-DPDK is added later or vice-versa,
the node will not be rebooted. As such kind of deployments
require network config changes, it requires more planning.
This scenario has to be handled on case-by-case basis.

The configuration of mariadb is done mostly in handlers and previously
the code would install the xinetd clustercheck script before calling
flush_handlers to bootstrap and initialise the database. This leads
to a situation where the clustercheck may be attempting to interact
with the database during bootstrapping and before the monitoring user
has been created.

This change moves the setup tasks for the clustercheck service until
after the database has been bootstrapped and the users created. This
means that any healthchecks from the loadbalancer will not be seen by
the database until after the setup is completed during the initial
deployment.

This patch aims to fix clusters that uses only private network
and monitoring_enabled.

It was observed that:

- no floating ip, so the kube_master_external_ip is null
- because of that, the value that gets sent to the shell
for KUBE_MASTERS_PRIVATE is actually [null]
- this happens when deploying prometheus-operator
( label monitoring_enable=true )

Those topics above results in a cluster taking around 30
minutes to be completed until monitoring gives up configuring
endpoints.

This change modifies _get_neutron_events_for_live_migration
to filter the event to just the subset that will be sent
at plug-time.

Currently neuton has a bug where by the dhcp agent
send a network-vif-plugged event during live migration after
we update the port profile with ""migrating-to:""
this cause a network-vif-plugged event to be sent for
configuration where vif_plugging in nova/os-vif is a noop.

when that is corrected the current logic in nova cause the migration
to time out as its waiting for an event that will never arrive.

This change filters the set of events we wait for to just the plug
time events.

This backport has squashed the follow up change
I37c712ba9a0ab88c44d10f80da3254ab6c463a68 to remove the unused
migration paramater orginally added by this patch to

Move code that calls out to os-brick for connectors,

This leaves cinder/utils.py more general-purpose
cinder-wide code, which reduces unnecessary binding
between things like ""cinder-manage db"" and calls
that load much more of cinder's code (and external
libraries like os-brick).

This also means that some drivers only need to

This patch includes 2 fix for the following issues:

1) ast.literal_eval() doesn't work with int and float values
See comment inline

2) Do not traverse and modify the same dict:
while traversing filters dict, we're modifying it inside the loop
which distorts the order of elements (adding modified elements in the
end). to fix this, i've used a temp dict that will be used to traverse
and modification will be done in the filters dict.

will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when

Until the requirements repository has as stable/victoria branch, tests will
continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

Before [1] we didn't have conditionals for tempest_black_regex
being set or not, therefore it had a default value of empty
string set in the role's defaults. However after [1] we do
have such conditionals which make setting the default value
unnecessary - especially when we're asking if the var is
defined - it will be always defined.
Therefore this patch removes the default setting of
tempest_black_regex and tempest_exclude_regex.

The patch also removes 'Set tempest_exclude_regex' task
introduced by [1] as it appears unnecessary as well. This
task simply copied tempest_black_regex value to
tempest_exclude_regex. However there are 2 tasks below which
do the same logic plus more - they build CLI arguments for
tempest where depending on which ansible var is used the
appropriate CLI arg is chosen - tempest_black_regex is set,
--black-regex will be passed to tempest (for backward
compatibility) and if tempest_exclude_regex is set,
--exclude-regex will passed to tempest.

The patch creates a new temporary ansible var which will be used
only internally. The role will store in it the CLI argument
chosen dynamically which is passed to tempest later. Before we
reused the tempest_exclude_regex variable for that, however that
causes problems whent the var is set on a role level as set_fact
won't override such var.

Compact Train database migrations into a single migration,
'402_train.py'.

Users will now need to update to Train before updating to Ussuri or
later.

Specific changes include:

- Add 'cross_cell_move' column to 'migrations' table (397)
- Add 'vpmems' column to 'instance_extra' table (398)
- Add 'hidden' column to 'instances' table (399)
- Add 'user_id' and 'project_id' columns to 'migrations' table (401)
- Add 'resources' column to 'instance_extra' table (402)

As there are boolean tables here, we're once again hitting the issue
whereby we need to explicitly disable contraints for boolean fields to
keep the schemas the same.

When testing, the previous base version was 391. It is now 402.

Users are experiencing timeout issues in certain environments, mostly
when volumes are too big (ie. multi-terabyte volumes), due to poor
network performance or upgrade issues that revolve around the SolidFire
cluster. A viable solution is to make driver timeout values
configurable in cinder.conf, so users can set these timeouts
according to their needs.

This patch adds two timeout settings to the SolidFire driver
(for cloning operation and globally to all api requests), to
allow users to set the appropriate timeouts for their environment.

When SolidFire is under heavy load or being upgraded, the
SolidFire cluster may automatically move connections from primary
to secondary nodes, in order to rebalance cluster workload.

Although this operation ocurrs very quickly, if an operation is made
to a volume at the same time it's being moved, there might be a
chance that API calls such as create snapshot could fail with
xNotPrimary error. Normally this will succeed on a retry of the
operation.

This patch fixes this issue by adding the xNotPrimary exception to
our list of retryable exceptions in the SolidFire driver.

In change I5b16d9ddc9cad56b367d1ad94abba95d675840b0, we started
disabling the USB controller whenever we deemed it unnecessary. We did
this by scanning through the requested devices and identifying those
that used the USB bus, only adding the controller if one or more
matching devices were found.

It transpires that just as QEMU adds PS2 input devices for x86, libvirt
automatically adds USB input devices for PPC64 [1]. These devices won't
appear in the XML we provide to libvirt, since we, the user, are not the
ones requesting them, but the disabling of the instance will result in
the instance failing to boot and libvirt emitting the following error
message:

  unsupported configuration: USB is disabled for this domain, but USB
  devices are present in the domain XML

Resolve this issue by bypassing the devices check and leaving
configuration of the USB controller to libvirt, as before.

One of the biggest frustrations larger operators have is when they
trigger a massive number of concurrent deployments. As one would
expect, the memory utilization of the conductor goes up. Except,
even with the default number of worker threads, if we're requested
to convert 80 images at the same time, or to perform the write-out
to the remote node at the same time, we will consume a large amount
of system RAM. Or more specifically, qemu-img will consume a large
amount of memory.

If the amount of memory goes too low, the system can trigger
OOMKiller which will slay processes using ram. Ideally, we do not
want this to happen to our conductor process, much less the work
that is being performed, so we need to add some guard rails to help
keep us from entering into situations where we may compromise the
conductor by taking on too much work.

Adds a guard in the conductor to prevent multiple parallel
deployment operations from running the conductor out of memory.

With the defaults, the conductor will attempt to throttle back
automatically and hold worker threads which will slow down the
amount of work also proceeding through the conductor, as we are
in a memory condition where we should be careful about the work.

The defaults allow this to occur for a total of 15 seconds between
re-check of available RAM, for a total number of six retries.
The minimum default is 1024 (MB), as this is the amount of memory
qemu-img allocates when trying to write images. This quite literally
means no additional qemu-img process can spawn until the default
memory situation has resolved itself.

This setting is a behavior change, requring the admin password

this setting by default adheres to the security recommendation
provided in the OpenStack security guide [0].

To enable this setting for Queens (the oldest supported OpenStack
release at the time of this commit), a new local_settings.py file was
copied from the Ocata template to ensure that any future versions will
inherit this setting until a new change is made.

Due to the security-checklist action currently failing [1], these have been
extracted to another class, and refactored in the zaza-openstack-tests

Neutron recently enhanced CIDR overlap checks for all the subnets

Testing every combination of role, endpoint and policy rule would
result in a huge test count, so to make testing the existing policy
rules complete and practical, the following guidelines are suggested:

- Only the default policy is tested, so inactive rules such as
  is_node_owner, is_node_lessee are ignored.
- Each rule is tested completely on one endpoint which uses it.
- A rule (such as baremetal:node:list) which inherits a parent rule
  (baremetal:node:get) is considered covered by the parent test.
- All endpoints need at least one test, but other endpoints which share
  a fully tested rule only need one denied test which shows that they
  are covered by some policy.

Also adds the initial pass of contributor documentation on how the
rbac testing works to try and express the mechanics and what to
expect to aid in reviewing/updating/editing the rules.

With podman-1.6.4 the global default pid-limits was hardcoded to 4096
and we had no way to tweak it.

With podman 2.X it is possible to override this in
/etc/containers/containers.conf with the pids_limit setting inside
[containers] in the /etc/containers/containers.conf ini-file:
$ cat /etc/containers/containers.conf
[containers]
pids_limit=6666

$ podman run --rm -it --net=host --name 'pids' edecd409281d sh -c 'cat /sys/fs/cgroup/pids/pids.max'

By adding this we keep the older 4096 default so we do not regress and
at the same time we allow an operator to override this globally.

Starting with the Mimic release and the Ceph RBD clone v2 feature,
it is no longer necessary to manage snapshot protection status.
The usage of clone v2 is controlled via the Ceph “rbd default
clone format” configuration option which defaults to “auto”, but
can be overridden to “1” to force the legacy clone v1 behavior or
“2” to force the new clonev2 behavior.

This must be configured in Ceph, it's not something that can be
configured on the Cinder side.

As an alternative, setting the minimum client to mimic
""$ ceph osd set-require-min-compat-client mimic""

Above all with Ceph RBD clone v2 support enabled, image snapshots
can be cloned without marking the snapshot as protected because
RBD automatically tracks the usage of the snapshot by clones. As
a result Ceph RBD clone v2 API improves performance.

This proposed patch adds logging messages for the operator
indicating whether Ceph has been configured to use the Ceph RBD
v2 clone feature.

In this way the operator can consult with the Ceph administrator
to take appropriate action.

You can determine which volumes are using the clone v2 feature
thanks to volume.volume.op_features(). It returns a value depending
on the v2 clone api being enabled or not.

Also includes squash to fix unit test from:

During update/upgrade/scale, already deployed node should
not be rebooted, if the kernel args are changed. Reboot of
the node should be planned by the user with migration and
downtime window. With this change, the kernel args will be
updated to the already deployed node, but it will not be
applied with reboot. For fresh nodes, where kernel args
entry is not found, the reboot will be applied.

In case, when the existing node is deployed without kernel
args but during an update the kernel args are added. At this
time a reboot is required, because there are other services
which depends on the kernel args like hugepages for OvS-DPDK
and iommu for SR-IOV.

It leaves with another edge case, when the node is deployed
with only SR-IOV and OvS-DPDK is added later or vice-versa,
the node will not be rebooted. As such kind of deployments
require network config changes, it requires more planning.
This scenario has to be handled on case-by-case basis.

The configuration of mariadb is done mostly in handlers and previously
the code would install the xinetd clustercheck script before calling
flush_handlers to bootstrap and initialise the database. This leads
to a situation where the clustercheck may be attempting to interact
with the database during bootstrapping and before the monitoring user
has been created.

This change moves the setup tasks for the clustercheck service until
after the database has been bootstrapped and the users created. This
means that any healthchecks from the loadbalancer will not be seen by
the database until after the setup is completed during the initial
deployment.

We facing errors related to the new pip resolver, this
topic was discussed on the ML and QA team proposed to
to test lower-constraints [1].

I propose to drop this test because the complexity and recurring pain needed
to maintain that now exceeds the benefits provided by this mechanismes.

Changes:
  setup.cfg
  test-requirements.txt

NOTE(moguimar): Aligning requirements with openstack/requirements to fix
requirements-check CI job.

Conflicts:
  .zuul.yaml
  lower-constraints.txt
  tox.ini

NOTE(stephenfin): Conflicts are due to changes in lower-constraints.txt
along with the change in base jobs from ussuri to train in .zuul.yaml
and a small difference in an adjacent tox job.

Installing kolla-ansible system-wide on CentOS 8 fails with:

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'setuptools_rust'

This error appeared following the release of cryptography 3.4, which now
includes Rust code. It can be installed without Rust using a Python
wheel, but only with more recent pip than version 9.0.3 available as RPM
on CentOS 8. The cryptography bug report [1] recommends pip>=19.1.1.

This change switches to using pip --user when installing kolla-ansible.

Also fixes an issue with ansible-lint which was failing on
etc/kolla/globals.yml due to a missing space before comments.
