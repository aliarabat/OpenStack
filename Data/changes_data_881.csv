Having the debian folder containing the packaging within the upstream
sources is a very bad idea, which everyone in Debian is trying to
discourage. This creates conflicts at many levels, plus the packaging
source should be kept and maintained in a single place (and in this
case, that would be Alioth, aka git.debian.org).

Since python-monascaclient has been uploaded to Debian (and therefore,
Ubuntu will sync from it), there's no need to carry the debian folder
here. So this patch removes it.

Note that I have just uploaded version 1.0.30+dfsg1-2 to Debian. The
""+dfsg1"" part shows I had to re-create an orig.tar.xz without the
debian folder.

1. What is the problem?
In the Tricircle, the cross pod L2 networking automation is
established after the VM is plugged into. The simplest way to
stretch one L2 network across multiple OpenStack instances is to
use a same VLAN network, but there is a lot of limitation: the
number of VLAN segment is limited, the VLAN network itself is not
good to spread across multiple sites, although you can use some
gateways to do so. But there are so many tenants in the cloud, and
new tenants could be added into the cloud dynamically, fixed physical
network configuration for dynamic tenant networking is hard to manage.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
To deal with the above problem, flexible tenant level L2 networking
automation across multiple OpenStack instances in one site or in
multiple sites is needed in the Tricirlce.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to
realize the solution?
To implement the features that networking automation supports more
than one bottom pod in AZ or multiple AZs for different use cases
in the Tricircle

The aim of this change is to make gate_hook and post_test_hook
more generic and prepare base for adding a new functional job
and tests. The patch also includes a number cosmetic changes
which should make the hooks' code easier to read.

- Moved all argument parsing to decode_args.sh.
- gate_hook: Extracted code related to configuring Octavia into a
  separate function.
- post_test_hook: Filling test_subset is not required if the aim
  is to run all set (api-* job).
- post_test_hook: Don't set OS_TEST_PATH and OS_TESTR_CONCURRENCY
  as it's also done in tox.ini.
- Style fixes.

This patch adds a mechanism to perform class initialization in Versioned
Objects.

One case where this is useful is when initializing the model class
attribute for all Persistent Versioned Objects.

We are currently trying to initialize the model class attribute for all
Versioned Objects in the registration hook, which is wrong on two
fronts, one is the place -it should be done in the
CinderPersistentObject- and the other is that we are doing it for all
classes -this could be easily fixed by checking if it's a
CinderPersistentObject class-.

This patch adds method `cinder_ovo_cls_init` to CinderPersistentObject
and changes the registration hook to call this method on any OVO class
that is registered if it exists.

1. What is the problem?
In production clouds, each availability zone (AZ) is built by modularized
OpenStack instances. Each OpenStack instance acts as a pod. One AZ
consists of multiple pods. Among the pods within an AZ, they are
classified into different categories for different proposes, for instance,
general propose, CAD modeling and so on. Each tenant is bound to one pod,
where it creates various types of resources. However such a binding
relationship should be dynamic instead of static. For instance when
some resources in the pod are exhausted, tenant needs to be bound to a
new pod in same AZ.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
To deal with the above problem, the Tricircle dynamically bind tenants
to pod which has available resources. We call this feature dynamic pod
binding

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to realize
the solution?
To realize dynamic pod binding, the following features need to be

1) To collect the usage in pod daily to evaluate whether the threshold
is reached or not.
2) To filter and weigh all the available pods for cloud tenants to bind
a tenant to a proper pod.
3) To manage and maintain all the active and historical binding
relationship.

This spec explains how Tricircle binds pods to tenants dynamically
in detail.

To make objects that have other objects as fields compatible to an
earlier version, oslo versioned objects uses either a manifest passed to
obj_to_primitive or the object's obj_relationships mapping.

Which means that if we don't have any of those mechanisms in place our
rolling upgrades mechanism will fail whenever we try to backport a
Versioned Object that has set an ObjectField field because Oslo
Versioned Object will not know how to backport that related object.

This patch introduces the usage of manifests on backports when we are
doing rolling upgrades.

For the manifest, we use the data in our Objects History.  Which means
that as long as we keep history in OBJ_VERSIONS right we will not have
to create and worry about keeping lists' child_versions field or our
versioned object's obj_relationships for fields with types
ListOfObjectsField and ObjectField.

We also don't have to worry about cascade version bumping, as in
changing the List OVO version whenever the OVO it contains gets bumped,
or bumping our OVO whenever one of the related OVO fields is bumped.

Current implementation of novaclient.api_versions.wraps allow to use
versioned methods for shell functions and resource managers. As resource
managers can have versioned methods, resource objects can have it too, but
it was not implemented yet. This patch fixes this omission.

Changes:
 - Add api_version property to base resource class. It is mapped to
   api_version property of manager class;
 - Move `novaclient.utils.generate_function_name` to
   `novaclient.api_versions._generate_function_name`, since this method is
   specific to microversion stuff and should not used outside api_versions
   module;
 - Rewrite _generate_function_name to handle class(owner) name. Previously,
   it was improssible to have two classes in one module with versioned
   methods with equal names.
 - Remove call of generate_function_name from novaclient.shell. Shell module
   should not take care about function identifiers. get_substitutions accepts
   object with __id__ property now.
 - Mark _add_substitution as private method, since it should not be used
   outside api_versions module
 - Split all versioned methods of Server resource from novaclient.v2.servers
   module.

The purpose of this change is to speed up the integrated gate.
The first playbook of the deploy will need to sort the rabbitmq
servers and set the fact but subsequent playbooks can avoid that
work. This could save 5-10 minutes in the integrated gate right now.

The change should be very low impact for deployers. The facts cache
is well documented (currently under Troubleshooting). Secondly, the
existing trailing task to record the sorted servers as a fact is
updated to better expose the task's impact on cached facts. If a
deployer changes the rabbitmq servers in the deploy infrastructure
they will need to clear the cached facts or run without fact caching
as documented.

I can't find any other doc impacts right now but may have missed one.

In a recent commit we moved away from wrapping network responses in
those weird object wrappers during scenario tests. This greatly
cleaned up the code and made things more consistent. However, there
was 1 getattr that was missed. It wasn't caught in the gate because
this call path wasn't executed (although a 3rd party CI did hit it).
This shows the importance of testing and making sure we don't rely
too heavily on self verification. This commit corrects the oversight
and cleans up the last reference to the network object wrappers.

For both the developer and new user use cases, there is rarely a
need to do anything before the undercloud is installed and images
and nodes are uploaded and registered. This patch moves up the
default stopping point to just before the overcloud deploy command
is run. This behavior is still changeable by changing the tags
passed to quickstart.sh.

Also fixes a small UI bug, where usage instructions get print out
even when not using quickstart's default playbook. These instructions
are unlikely to be accurate when used with a different playbook.

This adds the check to the nova-network API allocate_for_instance
method such that if no network is allocated for the instance and
'auto' was requested, we raise an error.

Also, if 'auto' is requested, we pass requested_networks=None
to the network rpc api (and network manager) since a network
with uuid 'auto' isn't going to exist.

Similar handling is done for deallocate_for_instance.

Some of the unit tests for allocate had to be fixed to pass
a valid requested_networks value.

This adds the auto-allocated-topology validation into
the neutron validate_networks path, which is called from
the compute API when creating instances.

If there are no available networks for the project and the
user specifically requested that a network be automatically
allocated for them (via the 'auto' network id on the request),
then we have to check that:

1. The auto-allocated-topology extension is available in neutron.
2. The dry-run validation for auto-allocated-topology passes.

Otherwise we fail the request with a 409 error. Since the
network API is raising a new type of exception, we have to handle
it in the REST API.

The test test_password_prompted() was expecting a keystone failure, but
because of an error in the requests/urllib3 library it was returning a
different exception and causing our tests to fail, see[1].

Independent of the the problem above on tests we should not rely on some
external library failing like that, we should mock this failures to make
our tests more reliable and that's what this patch is doing.

It is possible to deprecate an option, but there's no clear way to
state when this deprecation occured and when the option will actually
go away. This leaves the user with a decision to make. Nova, for
example, frequently includes the release that the option was removed in
as part of the help message like so:

    ""memcached_servers"" opt is deprecated in Mitaka. In Newton release
    oslo.cache config options should be used as this option will be
    removed.

This is a decision that the user shouldn't have to make. Add a
'deprecated_since' parameter to allow users to specify this information
in a uniform manner. The parameter allows for any string value.

A future work item would add a hacking or tox check to compare this
parameter against the expected deprecation version. For example, to
ensure all Nova parameters deprecated in '13.0' should be removed in
'14.0'. This will be done on a per-project basis.

The os-win vhdutils resize method, by default, treats the requested
size as the maximum VHD/x file size. Considering the size of the
internal metadata, the virtual size of the image will be slightly
smaller.

Resizing an image may fail when the image size is close to the
requested size, in which case the new calculated internal size may be
smaller than the current image internal size.

This fix consists in going back to the old behavior (pre os-win),
ensuring that the new VHD/x internal size always matches the requested
VHD/x size, regardless of the internal metadata overhead (which is
really small anyway).

In Cinder we don't have an indirection service to forward object methods
like Nova does (Conductor) so we shouldn't be defining all methods as
remotable since they are not.

If we ever decide to have a Conductor we can easily add them back where
appropriate, but for now they are only a hindrance:

- It's confusing, because most people don't understand what it actually
  means in Cinder and they just add it to the methods because they see
  it in other OVO methods.
- Every time we change a remote method's signature or add a new remote
  method to an object the hash of that object changes and we need to
  update our test_versions test, which is not necessary.
- This makes the linking of VOs with their list counterparts
  problematic, because everyone will need to know that there is no need
  to bump the version of a list object whenever they add or modify a
  remotable method.
- We are executing unnecessary code with decorators, even if it's not
  much, it's still wasted CPU time .

This patch removes all appearances of remotable and remotable_class
decorators thus making our OVOs consistent with our implementation and
removing the need of updating our tests on unrelated OVO changes.

When Conditional Update mechanism was introduced `conditional_update`
method was added to `CinderObject` instead of `CinderPersistenObject`.

Because this method was added to `CinderObject` other methods were added
as well.

And so we ended up with methods that make no sense in the base OVO
class, as they are only relevant for objects that have persistence and
can be retrieved from the DB.

This patch moves these methods (`get_by_id`, `refresh`,
`_get_expected_attrs`, and `conditional_update`) to
`CinderPersistentObject` where they should have been all along.

This test performs a backup followed by a restore and compares
the restored data with the original data.

This code was previously in the freezer-api repo. It fits better
into the freezer repo because:

- It interacts mostly with freezer-scheduler
- The freezer devstack gate also includes the freezer-api so it is easier to run an end-to-end test

List type allows to pass string values as default values, which are then
handled by splitting on commas. For formatting matters, if the default

This patch adds few functional tests to test OVN NB DB sync
and adds the gate hook script functions.

The functional test setup
 - will start an ovsdb-server with OVN NB DB.
 - will start an ovsdb-server with OVN SB DB. This connection is
   not used by this patch. But it is created because
      - It can be used later to test the chassis up/down events.
      - ML2 OVN driver now also connects to the OVN SB DB.
 - The ML2 OVN driver is configured to connect to these ovsdb-servers
 - Another IDL connection is established with the OVN NB DB server.

The test cases are validated by checking if the OVN NB DB is
updated properly or not.

This can be extended later to add more functional tests and
full stack tests if required.

Since 1.11.0 several useful features have been released. These
are already in use in telemetry projects where global requirements
are not being strictly followed. The development of the placement
API[1] in nova is being driven and tested by gabbi. Having the newer
features would be useful and there requirements are followed.

The updates include:

* ability to sort and filter on jsonpath evaluations
* using urllib3 as the http client instead of the mostly dead
  httplib2
* fixes to header evaluation
* $LAST_URL and $COOKIE substitutions
* ipv6 host support
* ability to force ssl for entire test run

When microversion>=2.26 is requested to show server details
we should pre-load 'tags' when getting the instance from the
database. Listing server details already does this, but show
didn't.

Failing to do this can also result in a 500 response from the
server. The scenario is you delete a server and then poll for
it to be gone using 'nova show'. In between the time that the
server is retrieved from the database and the view builder
creates the response, the instance is deleted and since
instance.tags is not set it will attempt to lazy-load the tags
which will fail with an InstanceNotFound.

We need to also fix the lazy-load issue in the instance object
but that will come in a follow-on change.

This commit fixes recently found issues with converting

1. If property string is unicode we shouldn't convert it
to str.

2. kernel_id and ramdisk_id are custom properties and for
this reason they have to be processed on 'properties' layer
and not with regular attributes.

3. In glance v1 it was possible to set empty string to
kernel_id and ramdisk_id properties. In glance v2 it's
forbidden and that's why we have to convert them to
None values.

test_resource_tracker had a test to ensure that DELETED instances are
not accounted for in the audit process that runs in the RT's
update_available_resource() method. test_tracker's instance fixtures
already included a DELETED instance and we were correctly checking in
a unit test that the DELETED instance's used resources were not
accounted for by the RT. Added a note in the test_tracker unit test
about this and deleted the duplicate unit test from
test_resource_tracker.py.

engineers who wish to build their own user interface using modern

support both browser and server based applications.

creating a new project for each of OpenStack's services; most plugins will
be kept in-tree. Furthermore, we'll be consuming the same clouds.yaml

Note that this change only impacts use of this charm when
Distributed Virtual Routing is enabled in a deployment.

Switch the generated configuration to use ""new"" style external
networks when ext-port is not set.  In this case we configure:

  external_network_bridge = (intentionally blank)
  gateway_external_network_id = (blank)

The current template configures external networks by using the default
external_network_bridge=br-ex (implied when not set).  This activates
legacy code which assumes that a single external network exists on
that bridge and the L3 Agent directly plugs itself in.
provider:network_type, provider:physical_network and
provider:segmentation_id are ignored.  You cannot create multiple
networks and you cannot use segmented networks (e.g. VLAN)

By setting external_network_bridge = (intentionally blank) the L2
Agent handles the configuration instead, this allows us to create
multiple networks and also to use more complex network configurations
such as VLAN.  It is also possible to use the same physical connection
with different segmentation IDs for both internal and external
networks, as well as multiple external networks.

Legacy/existing configurations where ext-port is set generate the same
configuration as previous and should continue to work as before.
Migration from legacy to new style configuration is not supported.

This patch is setting the [neutron] port_setup_delay configuration
option to 15 (seconds) for virtual environments using the ipmitool
driver (e.g VirtualBMC). This is due a potential race condition between
the neutron ports getting updated with the new DHCP options and the
ironic node booting too quickly (likely to happen on virtual
environments).

1. What is the problem
In test_plugin module, we define a stub class FakePlugin to
bypass real database access for unit tests. In some previous
test cases, FakePlugin object is directly created and then
we test its function, but after some changes in Neutron, we
also need to register the class path of FakePlugin to an
configuration option called core_plugin, otherwise some of
test cases will fail with ""core_plugin not configured"" error.

2. What is the solution to the problem
Register core_plugin for each test cases.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
   to realize the solution
Register core_plugin in setUp function then every test cases
can use this option.

With the implementation of I008bfdb2960800845703e721b38640b7434d1404
it should be safe to remove the AIO metadata checksum fix from
run-playbooks.

This patch implements the appropriate AIO configuration to ensure that
the fix is still implemented by the os_neutron role, and also implements
a convenience fix for repeated runs of run-playbooks (mostly as a proof
of concept right now).

The intent is still to wholly replace run-playbooks with the standard
production execution of the three high-level playbooks. This will be
implemented in a follow-on patch.

Previosly during delete_subnet in ml2 plugin ip allocation were removed
directly from database. This way ipam driver was unaware of this
deallocation.

Updated workflow to skip removing ip allocations directly from database.
Now ips are deallocated during update_port workflow (L1008).

This resolves issue with dhcp ports left in allocated state on ipam
provides side. Now they are correctly deallocated via update_port.

But this patch has next limitation: currently SLAAC allocations can
not be delete via update_port workflow, so ipam driver is still unaware
of such deallocations.
This part of issue is expected to be fixed as separate patch.

Subnet_in_use check was reworked. Previously it assumed that
auto-allocated ip are already deleted by the time of this check, but
with new workflow auto allocated ips are deleted later (on update_port).
So now this check verifies if there are any user allocated ips instead
of checking all allocations.

If we switch to using a retry and are more careful about handling errors
when a host is deleted or volumes are attached we don’t need to use the
lock.

For initialize_connection time when we go to create a host we run the
risk that a terminate_connection running in parallel deleted our host
from underneath us before the volume was attached. To handle that we
just catch the error in that scenario and try to create the host again.

The second issue for initialize_connection is if we try to create a host
and another initialize_connection running in parallel beats us to it. If
the host already exists we can catch the exception for create_host(..)
and retry, which will give us the existing one.

For terminate_connection time we run the risk that between when we
determine a host to be ready for deletion and actually deleting it a
new volume is attached. We can just swallow this error since the Purity
management API will not allow to delete a host with connected volumes.

However, it is under-documented (API docs only).  It is a neat and
simple feature that people are likely to find useful.

There is a number of exceptions available in tempest.lib which are duplicated
in the exceptions module in tempest. They are all identitical, except for one:
TimeoutException. The tempest.lib version inherits from RestClientException,
while the tempest version is a TempestException. The only class that should
use the former is the RestClient (and derivative), while it is used by ssh
client as well. Changing the type of exception raised by ssh.py would be a
backward incompatible change, so I think we cannot change this now.

DO NOT MERGE THIS.

I'm adding this here as a spec because it's easier to comment on and
review than putting it directly in as a blueprint. If we get to the
point of +A then we can just C&P the text out to a blueprint.

I think if we force plugins to only register their commands into their
own service_type namespace segment then alias from there into the root
namespace we can mitigate at least some of the namespace problem.

Kerberos is available if the requests_kerberos module was successfully
loaded in keystoneauth.extras.kerberos. kerberos_requests has no
meaning and causes keystoneauth1 to raise an error:

 AttributeError: ""'module' object has no attribute 'kerberos_requests'""

But this gets eaten by stevedore[1]so if logging is not set up the
result is that v3kerberos silently fails to load. This patch fixes the
typo that causes this.

To properly test the integration between Glance CORS feature and
Horizon Javascript environment uploading image files directly to Glance
(using this feature), we need to enable CORS support for Glance in
integration tests. Adding corresponding Devstack variable to configure
Glance in such a way that it accepts direct requests from Horizon
Javascript is the prerequisite step for the integration testing of this
feature.

By default Horizon and Glance are located on the same host, hence
default value cors.allowed_origin = http://$SERVICE_HOST should work.
If a more complicated setup is desired, where Horizon is located on a
different host, GLANCE_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN environment variable should
be exported to Devstack.

First, increase page_timeout to one minute, which should help in case
of a first couple of tests waiting for Apache workers to ""warm up"".

Second, reduce explicit_wait to 90 seconds (from 5 minutes), because
if something in Horizon doesn't complete in 90 seconds, then almost
for sure it won't complete in 5 minutes as well and only will spend
time, which is limited for integration tests.

This commit adds a gather_facts variable in the playbooks, which
is defaulted to True. If run_playbooks.sh is used, this commit adds
""-e gather_facts=False"" to the openstack-ansible cli for the playbook
run. Everything should work fine for deployers (because there is no
change for them), and for the gate (because fact caching is enabled)

It should speed up the gate by avoiding the long ""setup"" task cost for each host.
Instead it does the setup to the appropriate hosts, at the appropriate time.

I ran some tests locally that showed that when using the uwsgi
deploy the keystone server wasn't using all the processes
available. When I switched from ""threads"" to ""processes"" the
concurrent performance improved considerably. So I'm proposing
that devstack switch to processes to improve performance.

This commit took the commit here as basis, and added the Liberty specifics.

The volume v2 functional tests occasionally fail with
""unrecognized arguments: --private"". This appears to occur when
volume v1 and volume v2 functional tests are run at the same time
when one or more of the tests do not set OS_VOLUME_API_VERSION
appropriately.

This patch also fixes a timing issue seen when running the
tests locally due to a missing wait and moves the snapshot
test to volume v2 since it was written for v2.
