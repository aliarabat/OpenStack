need to be made to the base Mysql manager. The biggest change
is that we can no longer store the os_admin client credentials
in the server my.cnf file. This commit moves those credentials to
a .my.cnf file stored in the trove homedir. This will be read
by the guest when attempting sqlchemy connections to the local
mysql database and will also be picked up automatically by other
mysql clients (such as mysqladmin).

Also, since PXC 5.6 requires PXB 2.3, this commit fixes the issue
previously discovered with that combination. The previous fix was
to pin PXB to v2.2. The fix is to specify host=127.0.0.1 in the
client section of my.cnf.

Dickinson at
https://swiftstack.com/blog/2013/12/20/upgrade-openstack-swift-no-downtime/

Notes:

As part of this upgrade I have chosen to *not* migrate any data from the
old style swift_data container. This is because it was never intended to
be used in production; this fact is made clear in the docs.

In regards to testing, as of this patch we do not yet have an upgrade
task for the common containers (rsyslog and kolla-toolbox), so
attempting to upgrade swift will result in it failing to find the
kolla-toolbox. This will be true of any other upgrade until upgrade for
common is added. It can be worked around by deploying another role such
as keystone which will drag in the common role and start up
kolla-toolbox, after which Swift can be successfully upgraded.

Both of these tests were actually leaking UnexpectedMethodCallErrors
from mox due to the allocate_for_instance call being stubbed out
but the kwargs were in the wrong order.

Apparently something with mox, the stub_out fixture, and
NetworkInfoAsyncWrapper using nova.utils.spawn cause the stubs
to be on a greenthread so when mox raises the error, it doesn't
fail the actual test, it just gets logged to stderr by eventlet.

In the case of the test_run_instance_queries_macs test, this was
actually causing the test to run over a minute (presumably because
it would eventually hit some timeout in the thread, like an rpc
timeout maybe?). With this fix it drops that down to around 1 second
to run the test.

We really need to figure out what's causing the stub to go on the
thread so that the test doesn't get the UnexpectedMethodCallError
and fail but that could come in a later change if someone can
figure it out.

This makes a couple small, but significant changes to periodic recovery.

- Change the CUD calls for periodic recovery to use the Pool Manager's RPCAPI.

Periodic recovery is charged with fixing problems that have come about in
the normal course of operation. Sometimes things go very wrong and there
are a lot of resources that have an ERROR state. This change allows the work
generated to be distributed among active `designate-pool-manager` processes.
Hopefully resolving the issues faster, and reducing risk of random failure on
the one process generating the recovery events.

- Include zones that have been PENDING for a long time

After a certain time, a product of timeouts, intervals, and delays, changes
either should have successfully propagated, or gone to an ERROR state.
Unfortunately this doesn't happen on occaison. Certain random failures and
undiscovered bugs leave zones hanging out in PENDING state forever. By treating
these as states as errors, we (hopefully) ensure that Designate will clean up
these zones and return them to the happy path.

The API code emits a ton of deprecation warnings from the view builder
code using deprecated properties on the share DB object which proxies
to the share instance, so this changes the code to use the share.instance
property instead.

Note that since the tests are mocking out the share as a dict in a lot of
places, we have to handle accessing the instance as a dict entry rather
than an attribute on a sqlalchemy object. Because of this, the wrapper
class in the stubs module needed to be updated to actually work like a
dict container. This is done by extending the abstract base class
collections.Mapping and overriding the update method. Now the runtime
code can access attributes on the share like a dict (which old tests are
still using outside of the stubs module) or an attribute like would be
the case with the sqlalchemy object.

* Single universal ClientManager class was dropped in favor of
   of individual in-context methods to create OS clients without
   ClientManager restrictions.
* Environment class was renamed to ExecutionSession to avoid
   common confusion with io.murano.Environment
* execution_session_local module was introduced to simplify
   keep of per-execution session (per-deployment) data. This
   is similar to thread-locals with the difference that there can
   be many threads in single session.
* All OS-clients related code was migrated to keystone client
   sessions and API v3 (except for GLARE and Mistral that doesn't
   support sessions). This increases performance and solves
   authentication problems that could be caused by token expiration
   even with trusts enabled.
* [DEFAULT]/home_region setting was introduced instead of
   [murano]/region_for_services to configure what region
   should be used by the clients by default (where Murano API
   resides). All client factories respect this setting.

The Launch Cluster dialog only supports datastore clusters that
Trove can deploy.  Redis clusters can now be deployed by Trove.
The Launch Cluster dialog requires the following changes for Redis.

- Customized the Launch Cluster dialog fields for Redis
- Added a new Redis specific cluster details panel.
- Modified the Trove api to specify the volume parameter in
cluster_create only if the value is greater than 0.
- Added Redis to the db_capability helper.
- Modified the Trove test data and added unit tests for the
customized fields depending on the datastore selected.

broadview-collector is a plugin-based, scalable service that allows
for the publishing of networking underlay data supplied by
openstack/broadview-lib to services like OpenStack Monasca, and
OpenStack Ceilometer. The initial contribution targets Monasca API,
but the plugin architecture allows broadview-collector to be extended
to support other metrics-based services as well.

Each plugin consists of two objects derived from base classes defined
by broadview-collector. A serializer object converts data received by
broadview-collector into a JSON format that is acceptable to the
target metric collection system. A publisher object takes this
serialized data and publishes it to the target metric system. Both
the serializer object and publisher object are registered in a
configuration file. broadview-collector supports multiple publisher
plugins at the same time.

This project is the second of an overall contribution that will supply
BroadView metrics data gathered by broadview-lib to monitoring
projects like Monasca.

We have had a ""untested and risky to use in production"" log warning
message for this driver since Kilo, it is currently broken (see below),
there are no obviously active users or contributors, and we are planning
on enabling Zookeeper usage by adopting the tooz library.

bug #1443910 shows that the driver fails to load because eventlet 0.17
broke evzookeeper by moving _SocketDuckForFd from eventlet.greenio to
eventlet.greenio.py2 in commit 449c90a. The 0.17 release was in Feb,
2015. The evzookeeper library hasn't been updated since Sep 2012 and the
sole maintainer is the original author of the zookeeper servicegroup
driver.

The tooz driver spec - Ibf70c2dbe308fc8e4dd277d8c75c4445b3dfce90 -
proposes a formal deprecation period for the zk driver, during which
existing zk driver users are encouraged to move to tooz. However, given
the state of the zk driver, we must conclude that there are no existing
users who need a graceful migration path. Removing the driver will
avoid potential confusion for new users and simplify the path to
adopting tooz.

Many well-known libraries have a conventions regarding which
alias to use. Choosing a different one will not break the code
but makes it less readable and harder to maintain for other
developers. Unless there is specific reason, it is usually best
to use the recommended alias which most people are already
familiar with. For datetime this convention is dt.

There were three misakes in the documentation for the flavor properties
related to CPU pinning policy:

* The property is 'hw:cpu_policy', not 'hw:dedicated' [1]
* It is not necessary to set the overcommit ratio for this to work.
  Instead, host agreggates should be used to prevent resourcing
  conflicts between pinned and unpinned instances [2]
* Like NUMA awareness, this feature is currently only supported by
  libvirt

As an alternative to using associators we have to manually get
the related Msvm_Processor classes.
Msvm_HostedDependency is the association class between
Msvm_NumaNode and Msvm_Processor. We need to use this class to
relate the two because using associators on Msvm_Processor
will also result in a crash.

This patch adds register_mutate_hook to ConfigOpts. When
mutate_config_files is otherwise finished, it calls all the registered
hooks. Each hook is passed the complete, mutated conf object, plus a
dict of just the mutated keys with old and new values.

Currently there's no way to change or remove a hook once registered.
There's no obvious usecase for this (to me at least) and the direct
implementation where we accept a unique slug alongside each hook has a
good back-compat story (generate slugs if one is not provided) so I've
plumped for the absolute simplest system.

Hooks are called in a non-deterministic order. This is intentional, it
makes it easy to avoid duplicates in the collection of hooks and
enforces independence of hook functions. It also means we don't need a
complex API for inspecting and reordering this collection.

Initially we wanted to avoid hooks in oslo.config entirely. This leads
to two problems. One, Nova delegates calling mutate_config_files to
oslo.service. How is oslo.service to know which other oslo libs Nova
uses and hence which need to be notified? We could solve this by
passing a list of hooks to oslo.service from Nova. Ugly but workable.
However, then if Nova is using oslo.foo and oslo.foo adds support for
mutable config, this leads to problem two. We must patch Nova to pass
the new hook to oslo.service. With 30+ OpenStack applications, this
would be tedious.

The collection is held on the ConfigOpts object because some projects
use multiple configs. I could offer a decorator which takes the conf
to register with as an argument but this would only be useful to
projects which use a global conf and generally seems like extra code
for minimal benefit.

Doug suggested offering a hook per option or group. The former is
inefficient when multiple options relate to a single resource. The
latter falls down on the default group, which multiple things need to
be notified about changes to.

The library will be used by the AMT and DRAC drivers in Ironic. They are
using the WSMan protocol for communication. Both used openwsman
previously but the DRAC driver recently moved to its own client
implementation, which is also in the interest of the AMT driver because
of the limitations of openwsman.

The Hyper-V Neutron Agent, during its first loop, will iterate
over all the switch ports, checking their proper setup. In order
to avoid wasting time querying the necessary WMI objects for each
port, they are cached first.

Initialises the cache for the mentioned objects. Thus, they will be
retrieved from the cache while processing 'foo' port.

This will also improve the general performance of the agent.

it uses the wrong guard predicate. Nova doesn't monkey_patch `os`, so
this change switches to checking against `socket` module instead.
Neither of these is strictly ""correct"" for our os.pipe/fdopen case, but

Since l2gateway binds vxlan(virtual side) to vlan(physical side) segment.
We are extracting only vxlan segment from the virtual network.
Since multi segment network can have multiple segmentation id's belonging
to different network types(vlan, gre, vxlan, etc), we are extracting the
vxlan segment from it.
We are checking for multiple vxlan segments in the network since ovsdb
does not allow multiple vxlan segmentation id's to associate for same
vlan (physical side) while creating l2_gateway_connection.
For Ex: say multi segment network has two vxlan segment id's 1000 and 2000.
If we create a l2_gateway_connection for this network by providing physical
side vlan segment as 500, the bindings should be 1000:500 and 2000:500,
this is not allowed in ovsdb hardware vtep schema.

Currently, the 'HTTPClient' in neutronclient doesn't mask the auth

invoke neutronclient, the token may therefore be directly exposed
in a log file. This commit makes such logging more secure by hashing
the auth token.

/usr/local/{sbin,bin} is a standardised location for admins to install
non-distro executables, and these executables are no less ""trustworthy""
than /usr/bin and friends.  See neutron and cinder's rootwrap.conf (and
probably others), and typical distro default values for
sudoers/secure_path for extremely similar precedents that all include
/usr/local/*bin.

In particular, some sort of change like this is required for
oslo.privsep to find its ""privsep-helper"" executable in
devstack (installed into /usr/local/bin via pip).  The only open
question (imo) is whether this change is made here in nova (and any
other project that doesn't already have this), or rootwrap.conf is
modified in the same way at ""deployment time"" by devstack and other
deployment methods.  Doing it here means it is far more likely to ""just
work"" for the common case of installing at least one affected command
into /usr/local.

See I710cf142b834381c00e651cfc062299ae755c33f for some brief discussion
of doing this via devstack, and pointers to earlier neutron, etc
discussion.

Currently 'force_gateway_on_subnet' configuration is set to True
by default and enforces the subnet on to the gateway. With this
fix 'force_gateway_on_subnet' can be changed to False, and
gateway outside the subnet can be added.
Before adding the default route, a route to the gateway IP is
added. This applies to both external and internal networks.

This configuration option is deprecated, and should be removed
in a future release. It should always allow gateway outside the
subnet. This is done as a separate patch

goal. This patch is the first step in creating a new
Dashboard section for Admin Users in the Cloud Admin Guide,
as disucssed in the User Guide Specialty team meetings.

1.) Moving:
   dashboard_manage_host_aggregates.rst
   dashboard_manage_flavors.rst
   dashboard_admin_manage_stacks.rst
   dashboard_manage_instances.rst
   dashboard_manage_images.rst
   shared_file_systems_manage_shares_dashboard.rst

2). Remove the Images and Instances content from the compute-images-instances.rst

3.) Move the Shared file system dashboard content out of
    shared_file_system.rst, and into the Dashboard.rst chapter.

Changes like [1] revealed that we run rally jobs even
if we do not have to. It turns out a skip-if clause
added to the rally project masked a precendent one,
thus triggering rally runs on any doc change for any

Move the skip rules to the proper place so that rally jobs are skipped
as intented.

This skips for rally also the gate-rally-dsvm-cli job which was run
before. The rally file match list has been adjusted to remove the
samples directory, jobs should be run if it gets updated.

In Id7936be290b6febd18deb4c2db8ea4d678d4d9b1 and
I8bf7cbaa7015bb61656ab90ccc8f944aaeebb095 parts of the ec2
infrastructure were removed that had been deprecated and warned about
in Liberty.

However, changes were made to the metadata server in these changes as
well, none of which had been warned about, and arguably should not be
removed ever. The metadata server is an AWS construct, and given the
implementation order of APIs in Nova (ec2 was the first API) it shares
code with the ec2 base classes. But it's the ec2 API we were
deprecating out and deleting.

Removing these breaks anyone upgrading using the metadata server, as
was seen by the neutron multinode job.

In addition, paste filters should *never* return a response code
directly. Doing so means they block processing the rest of the

Currently the cinder backup service is tightly coupled to the cinder
volume service in ways that prevent scaling out backup services
horizontally across multiple physical nodes.

This patch is to loosen this coupling to enable backup processes
to run on multiple nodes without having to be colocated with volume
services.

The following works are not included in this patch:
1. Remote attach snapshot.
2. Vendor specific work.
3. Remove current backup_volume in driver.
4. Rolling upgrades.

Modifies the import to actually happen when API() is called instead of
when the module is loaded.

This is necessary because CONF.volume_api_class is always evaluated as
the default value since the config file hadn't been parsed yet when the
module is loaded.

Nova fixed this problem a while ago for the compute driver in
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/14353/.

Client option rpc_response_timeout means ""Seconds to wait for a response
from a call""[1], but it is used by cast in zmq driver. And it's not the
right way that underlying zmq driver uses an upper client option.

So rpc_response_timeout should not be used in zmq driver, and let's just
remove it since rpc client has passed the parameter[2].

When range GET (or COPY) for an EC object requested, if the requested range
starts from more than last segments alignment (i.e.
ceil(object_size/segment_size) * segment_size), proxy server will return
the original content length w/o body, though Swift should return an error
massage as a body and the length of message as the content length.
The current behavior will cause stuck on some client. (e.g. curl)

This patch fixes that proxy enables to return correct response, even if such
an over range requested.

Tempests tests for zaqar are not well maintained at this time.
Current situation is, when running zaqar from trunk, and testing it with
Tempest / Smoke, a bunch of tests are failing, all the time.

I reported https://bugs.launchpad.net/zaqar/+bug/1547188 with the hope
of zaqar team would take care of it.

In the meantime, it would be safe to disable smoke tag for zaqar tests
and let people choose what they want to run, because some tests are
failing.

When tests will be fixed, we can add smoke tag to some tests, but right
now, it would be safer to disable them.

This adds a few useful decorators to help in the common
case of creating a bunch of linear tasks that execute
one after the other.

This creates a 'nth_task' and 1..9 specializations of
that decorator to be able to create a simple sequence
linearly ordered tasks from decorated functions.

It also provides a class method on the linear pattern
that will turn a provided set of these decorated functions
or other task objects (with an 'order' attribute) into
a useful linear flow (that can then be executed using an
engine).

Initialization of the bridges is currently non-atomic, requiring
many invocations of ovs-ofctl. This commit introduces concept of
OpenFlow ""transactions"" - flows are buffered and then
created/modified/deleted in a single ovs-ofctl invocation instead.

The --bundle parameter of ovs-ofctl could be used if OpenFlow14 was
always supported, thus transactions would be really atomic. This is
not case at this moment

Potentially fixes bugs 1514056 and 1264608

Also, Bootswatch's 'paper' sets the color of the
.dropdown-header to be a light gray regardless of whether its an
inverse navbar. This is not ideal. It should inherit the same color.

The dellscapi unit tests contain two occurences of an

Because mock will magically create an 'asert_called_once_with'
method, this typo masks a problem with the test_manage_unmanage

In the Angular code we have established Actions that we are using in
table rows and headings.  These actions right now are collected by
individual custom services which are in turn used by pages that need
the actions (Image table page uses Image row and batch actions).

This patch eliminates the need to write custom services and instead
centralizes the registration of these actions.  On registraton they are
associated with a string which is a resource-type specification (used
in Searchlight, for example: 'OS::Glance::Image').  This makes the actions
available to any party needing to use them.

The actions are registered in modules' run clauses so they are
automatically registered, with the desired actions injected into the
registration.  This makes it easy for people to add their own actions
or their own resource types.
