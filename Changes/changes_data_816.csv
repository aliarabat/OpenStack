not usable in some setups.

Some functions were moved from neutron.tests.base to

Because we are using the building platform's ""yum"" to do the initial
install into the chroot, it is affected by the base-system's
/etc/yum.conf.

pip-and-virtaulenv in I82acb865378a0fa5903a6267bfcee0e2962eced0 added
""exclude=python-pip..."" in /etc/yum.conf to stop the package manager
overwriting the installed pip.  Now our CI images have built with
this, we are now picking up this exclude on centos.  Since on F24
dnf->python->python-pip we end up failing to build the the chroot
because python-pip can not be satisifed.  In a general sense, however,
this could be caused by any configuration put into /etc/yum.conf that
is incompatible with installing into the chroot.

yum has the option to disable all excludes which is used here.  This
seems to be the best way to isolate the chroot install from any
excludes that may have been done on the base system for various
reasons.  I did consider using a completely separate yum.conf we ship
with dib ... but let's start simple.

This should fix the current gate failures on centos

There is changes in way tempest tox runs tests by using the tempest run
command directly instead of some bash script.

With tempest run you specify a regex with a '--regex' parameter and to
keep backwards compatibility this is added to the tempest tox
definitions.

But in Nova tests scripts it is being used after concurrency and ends up
having a call equivalent to:

  tempest run --regex --concurrency=2 $tempest_regex

which obviously is incorrect. Simply switching the arg order should work here.

dogpile.cache's region invalidation is not designed to work across
processes. This patch enables distributed invalidation of keys in a
region.

Instead of using a static cache key, we use the original cache key
and append a dynamic value to it. This value is looked up in
memcached using the region name as a key. So anytime the value of
the region key changes the cache keys in that region are
effectively invalidated.

Conflicts:
	keystone/assignment/core.py: imports were fixed
	keystone/catalog/core.py: imports were fixed
	keystone/common/cache/core.py:
                dogpile.cache doesn't have invalidation strategies
                in 0.5.8. Because of that, call to
                region.invalidate was redefined.

When no boot mode is explicitly passed to iLO drivers, it picks
default boot mode based on series of factors like, pending boot
mode setting, UEFI boot mode support on the node. This causes
confusion to the users as these factors are node specific and
beyond user's control. User expects a predictable behavior when
no boot mode is explicitly passed.
A new configuration parameter '[ilo]/default_boot_mode' has
been added to specify default boot mode. It would be used if no
boot mode is explicitly passed to iLO drivers.

Since the keystone-manage bootstrap command has been implemented we
can refactor our installation process to use that, instead of
creating the Identity service and endpoints manually with the
ADMIN_TOKEN.

This also includes moving a bunch of the information in
keystone-services.rst to the get-started-identity.rst guide, since
creating the keystone service and endpoints manually is no longer
required (bootstrap does this for us now). The remaining information
in keystone-services.rst for exporting environment variables to use
the ``openstack`` client were moved to the keystone-install.rst
document since that's essentially the last step of keystone's
installation and configuration.

This commit add regex first while running tempest tox

There is changes in way tempest tox runs tests by using the tempest run
command directly instead of some bash script.

With tempest run you specify a regex with a '--regex' parameter and to
keep backwards compatibility this is added to the tempest tox
definitions.

But in Nova tests scripts it is being used after concurrency and ends up
having a call equivalent to:

  tempest run --regex --concurrency=2 $tempest_regex

which obviously is incorrect. Simply switching the arg order should work here.

- Simplifies some of the CLI guides to be more explicit

- Added a link to the networking appendix.

- As per https://review.openstack.org/369650 the

Auth option prompting happens waaaay to early in the default
os-client-config flow, we need to defer it until adter the commands
have been parsed.  This is why ClientManager.setup_auth() exists,
as it is not called until the first attempt to connect to a server
occurs.  Commands that do not require authentication never hit this.

Also, required options were not being enforced.  By doing this we handle
when no authentication info is present, we fail on missing auth-url rather
than attempt to prompt for a password (default auth is password).

Migration 002 sets the password created_at column to a TIMESTAMP type
with a server_default=sql.func.now(). There are a couple problems
that have been uncovered with this change:
* We cannot guarantee that func.now() will generate a UTC timestamp.
* For some older versions of MySQL, the default TIMESTAMP column will
automatically be updated when other columns are updated:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/timestamp-initialization.html

This patch fixes the problem by recreating the password created_at
column back to a DateTime type without a server_default:
1) Drop and recreate the created_at column
2) Update the created_at value
3) Set the created_at column as not nullable

This commit switches the tox commands that run tempest to use tempest
run instead of pretty_tox.sh. Tempest run is the primary method of
running tempest moving forward so we should dogfood it where we can.
This also officially starts the deprecation timer (which was long
overdue as these were unofficially deprecated before) on the
run_tempest.sh and pretty_tox scripts as we move to having a unified
method of running things.

While reviewing nova fix I03be8100155d343eb6a4ea9eda3f1498ad3fb4cf
it was noticed that when you delete a floating IP via the Nova
API which is associated to a server, and using neutron, the
server's instance_info_cache is not directly updated, which is what
populates the server.addresses field. nova-network does refresh the
info_cache when deleting an associated floating IP.

This patch adds validation to a scenario test that runs on both
nova-network and neutron to check this behavior.

floating IP then info_cache is not refreshed.

Currently 'provisioned_capacity_gb' is expected from
the drivers as part of capability reporting.
If driver does not provide it, it defaults to 'allocated_capacity_gb'.
But if driver does not provide both 'allocated_capacity_gb' and
'provisioned_capacity_gb' then 'provisioned_capacity_gb' defaults to 0.
Which affects later calculation of  'provisioned_ratio'.

Hence fixing it by summing up sizes of all the shares of
that host and taking that as 'provisioned_capacity_gb',
in such case.

This is a squash of 2 backports to fix Galera deployment on Liberty.

1) Enable galera replication for Mariadb 10.1

The generated galera config has to include additional settings for
galera to be active on MariaDB 10.1.
wsrep_on must be explicitely set to ON. On MariaDB 5.5, this was
implicitely set as soon as wsrep_provider was specified.
a valid wsrep_cluster_address must be configured in addition to
wsrep_on, otherwise recovery command mysqld_safe --wsrep-recover
cannot retrieve replication state, and cluster cannot be bootstrapped.
These explicit settings are backward compatible with MariaDB 5.5 since
the two variables exist in both versions of MariaDB.

Closes-Bug: 1563751
(cherry-picked from commit df343c35ce468c34b2102f0158d36017089c776d)

2) [liberty-only] mysql: never add brackets to mysql_bind_host

The patch was submitted in Newton, but we can't backport it:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/369369/
Don't add brackets on mysql_bind_host parameter in Galera config.
Having brackets from this parameter works with old version of
Galera but not newest one.
EPEL upgraded the version of Galera, so we need this change to deploy
TripleO in HA environment

This is the initial work to have a function that migrates a full HA
architecture as deployed in Mitaka to the HA architecture as deployed in
Newton where only a few resources are managed by pacemaker.

The sequence is the following:
1) We remove the desired services from pacemaker's control. The services
   at this point are still running normally via the systemd service as
   invoked by pacemaker
2) We do a ""systemctl stop <service>"" on all controllers for all the
   services that were removed from pacemaker's control. We do this to make
   sure that during the yum upgrade, the %post sections that call
   ""systemctl try-restart"" do not take ages, because at this point during
   the upgrade rabbit is down. The only exceptions are ""openstack-core""
   and ""delay"" which are dummy pacemaker resources that do not exist on
   the system
3) We do a ""systemctl start <service>"" on all nodes for all the services
   mentioned above.

We should probably merge this patch only when newton has branched as it
is very specific to the M/N upgrade.

The following warning appears in the unit test logs a number of times.

    ""UserWarning: This test uses methods that set internal oslo_db
state, but it does not claim to use the database. This will conflict
with the setup of tests that do use the database and cause failures
later.""

This patch fixes the last two warnings from:

    unit.compute.test_compute_api.py

Note that this warning is only emitted once per unit test worker, so new
offenders will show up in the logs each time you fix a test until they
are all gone.

In nova/cmd/manage.py, on line 294 [1] there is the following line:

  if value['limit'] < 0 or value['limit'] is None:

The problem occurs when value['limit'] is None, as this line tries
to compare None (object) with an integer value.

This comparsion is totally okay (without errors) in Python27.
But, if you run this on Python34, a TypError is raised:

  TypeError: unorderable types: NoneType() < int()

It is simply fixed with swapping the two expressions within the
if condition. Now if value['limit'] is None, the first expression
becomes true and second one does not get evaluated.

when iPXE is enabled, it is possible for the bootloader to download
the deploy kernel and ramdisk directly from Swift TempURL instead of
downloading them to conductor and serving from local HTTP server.

This patch adds the required logic and a new config option
`ipxe_use_swift` (default False), setting which to True enables
using Swift TempURLs for deploy ramdisk and kernel.

Note that local caching and serving for kernel and ramdisk of user image
is still performed for partition images that require non-local boot,
as moving those to use TempURLs will make it impossible for the user
to reboot the instance when TempURLs time out or image is deleted from
Glance/Swift.

The `openstack overcloud deploy` command currently attempts to ""reset"" a plan
when it deploys, this is for backwards compatibility. Having plans be used
behind the scenes in the command shouldn't change the behaviour of the

There are various problems with updating plans. This is a workaround that
resolves them until we can better evaluate, design and implement a good system
for updating plans. https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1623431

stopping dnsmasq. This would lead to a file handle remaining to the
interface which would cause OVS to completely freak out and assign
the same ofport to multiple ports.

In Newton, Aodh will be using its own mysql DB rather than
using ceilometer's mongo instance. This means we need to
migrate any existing alarm and alrm history data from
ceilometer DB to aodh mysqlDB. Upstream aodh provides us
with a aodh-data-migration utility. We need to invoke this
during the mitaka->newton upgrade procedure so data is
migrated as expected and aodh mysql backend takes over.

When a resource failed, the stack state was set to FAILED and current
traversal was set to emoty string. The actual traversal was lost and
there was no way to delete the sync points belonging to the actual
traversal.

This change keeps the current traversal when you do a state set, so that
later you can delete the sync points belonging to it. Also, the current
traversal is set to empty when the stack has failed and there is no need
to rollback.

The way how we handled the regular expressions had a lot of
limitation.

 - We are not able to pass huge arguments to testr, it makes
   difficult to have long list if accepted and/or rejected test cases,
   but we can pass a path to a file of test cases,
   which can be arbitrary big.
 - How we wanted to handle the backlists before was not worked together
   with the regular selecting regex because it consumed the pattern.
   Now the blacklisting happens in a separated phase after the selecting
   regex search.

This change just allows the new code path to run when both
 a blacklist_file and a selecting regexp specified.

The new way depends on the usual test discovery and just
filters the output of the discovery command,
this strategy can be the default in the future, now I just
wanted to preserve the old behavior as much as possible in
all the other cases.

This reverts commit 36bf170f347f927fd7f20b5868dc686041081862.

The construction and validation phases of intrinsic functions are
deliberately separated, to:

- Reduce the amount of unnecessary work done
- Reduce the risk of changes to validation breaking the loading of existing
  stacks from the database
- Ensure that the most critical errors are reported to the user first

This patch reverts a commit that sought to combine the two phases. There
was no linked bug and no explanation other than that this 'improved'
things.

It does not, however, restore the check for the Removed function during
properties translation (and the associated test), because I believe its
original existence was based on a misconception. There is no way in
practice for a hot.functions.Removed object to appear in the properties a
translation rule is operating on.

We used to try to acquire the stack lock in order to find out which engine
to cancel a running update on, in the misguided belief that it could never
succeed. Accordingly, we never released the lock.

Since it is entirely possible to encounter a race where the lock has
already been released, use the get_engine_id() method instead to look up
the ID of the engine holding the lock without attempting to acquire it.

One of the requirements[1] for Neutron stadium projects is to have
in-tree developer documentation.  This creates a stub for that.  We can
expand on it once the stub is in, but this will permit us to set up
publishing while we iterate on it.

Change I743e676372703e74178c79683dd622d530981e04 removed volume
backend driver calls for creating and restoring volume backups.
The overridden methods for creating and restoring backups in
the VMDK driver is no longer called and this breaks the backup-
restore of volumes created by the VMDK driver. Now backup and
restore of volumes use os-brick connectors.

Change Ia1a20f93780593b1efbb74484c3fdd3ca3564290 added a new
connector in os-brick to support vmdk volumes. The new vmdk
connector requires additional connection info so that it can
connect to vCenter server and access the volume vmdk to perform
volume connect and disconnect.

redefining it which can have undesirable effects. This change disables the
default list_extend property within the config_template allowing a deployer
to fully redefine a given pipeline.

not to be modified or made unique within each charm repo.

This is to ensure consistency across charm repos in tox
target naming, approach and purpose, also giving the
charm dev and test experience additional consistency.

Also create empty dirs with .keep files where necessary.
Some classic charms have actions and/or lib dirs, and some
do not. In all classic charms, flake will now check those
dirs to ensure lint coverage of existing or future content.

Fix Amulet test connection check and resync charm-helpers
to pull in rabbitmq-server amulet test helper update.

Add osplatform to charm-helper sync yaml to meet new
import requirements in the c-h core and fetch modules.

Disable precise tests until removal of precise nrpe charm
is resolved in the charm-store.

Disable SSL tests for <= trusty targets from xenial hosts.

This patch fixes a problem which prevented Ironic from honoring the
interval values configuration for the periodic tasks. Since the interval
values are passed to a decorator, the configuration options should be
evaluated prior to importing the module which contains the periodic tasks.

In our case this was not happening due to the chain of imports going
from ironic.cmd.conductor -> ironic.common.service -> ironic.api.app
-> ... -> ironic.conductor.manager. This caused the @periodic
decorators to be evaluated before the configuration options were loaded.

This patch breaks that chain of imports by separating the WSGIService
and RPCService classes into two separate files. The conductor uses the
RPCService, and since it is now in a separate file from WSGIService, it
no longer pulls in ironic.api.app, ..., and ironic.conductor.manager.
(ironic.api.app was being imported because WSGIService needed it.)

The exception NotificationEventTypeError was used when an invalid

without causing a ValueError.

Add a unit test to show that changing status to an invalid value does
raise a ValueError.

Identity v3 credential APIs return credential information
in 'blob' element which is a dict embedded in string.

And service client does json.load on that and then return the
response which should not be done.

Each service client should return the raw response they gets
from API server.

This commit fix the same and move the json loading of nested dict
on test side.

In order for the test repo to work for CentOS properly, we need to be
able to create multiple networks in a more modular way. Additionally, we
should be able to specify a dict of networks to configure and have them
configured.

To allow this to be extended we setup a network interface ""type"" which
defaults to ""default"". This should cover all current requirements but
could be extended if needed.

For CentOS/Red Hat specifically, we need to drop down post-up/pre-up
scripts for specific networks - this requires an additional loop task to

This is a precursor for moving Swift and Nova to use the
openstack-ansible-tests repository, both require custom networking which
is not serviced by the current configuration. This is also a precursor
for adding CentOS/RedHat support for openstack-ansible projects.

The Flat and Lvm backends do not create a 'base image' (the file in the
image cache) when creating an ephemeral or swap disk. However, cache()
expects it to exist when checking if a resize is required, which
resulted in an exception.

This was previously address in change I46b5658e. That fix assumed that:

1. Resize is only required for root disks created from images.
2. There will always be an entry in the image cache in this case.

The first assumption is correct, but unfortunately the second is not.
When creating an Rbd-backed instance from an image in an Rbd-backed
glance store, we clone directly from glance and don't create an entry
in the image cache. The code to do this is defined in a callback in
driver._create_and_inject_local_root(). This did not fail prior to any
fix because Rbd.get_disk_size() ignores its argument and always
returns the size of the 'top' disk.

With change I46b5658e we directly tested for an image cache entry,
which doesn't exist in this case, and then didn't do the resize. This
means that in a system configured this way we will never resize a root
disk to the size specified in the flavor.

The new check is simply to check the size of path directly. This
continues to work for Flat and Lvm, as path always exists even when
base doesn't. It also continues to work for Rbd because Rbd still
ignores the given path and uses its own. I'm not entirely sure why we
didn't always do this.

As pointed out by ftersin, this is also part of the fix for resize of
ephemeral disks.

I have retained the test from the original change unmodified because
it still tests that the originally reported bug is fixed. However, I
have not added a test for the Rbd case because:

1. The call path from _create_and_inject_local_root into Rbd is
   sufficiently complex to be very hard to test meaningfully.
2. ...which probably explains why it has never had any test coverage.
3. The real fix is to restructure this code, which is already pending
   review.

Sometimes the mongodb_replset resource fails with:

Could not evaluate: Can't find master host for replicaset tripleo.

This issue is intermittent so the fix cannot be perfectly verified, but
the assumption is that if we wait for MongoDB to be reachable on all
nodes, it will assure that the members will appear to the puppet module
as alive when creating or verifying the replset. If the validation
fails, it should help us uncover which of the members was causing
trouble.

IronicHostManager currently overrides the _init_instance_info()
method of the base class and unconditionally skips population of
instances information for all compute nodes, even if they are not
Ironic ones.

If there are compute nodes with the hypervisor_type different from
Ironic in the same cloud. the instances info will be missing in
nova-scheduler (if IronicHostManager is configured as a host manager
impl in nova.conf), which will effectively break instance affinity
filters like DifferentHostFilter or SameHostFilter, that check set
intersections of instances running on a particular host and the ones
passed as a hint for nova-scheduler in a boot request.

IronicHostManager should use the method implementation of the base
class for non-ironic compute nodes.

Ib1ddb44d71f7b085512c1f3fc0544f7b00c754fe fixed the problem with
scheduling, this change is needed to make sure we also populate the
instances info on start of nova-scheduler.

IronicHostManager currently overrides the _get_instance_info() method
of the base class and unconditionally returns an empty dict of
instances for a given compute node.

The problem with that is that in a heterogeneous cloud with both
libvirt and ironic compute nodes this will always return {} for the
former too, which is incorrect and will effectively break instance
affinity filters like DifferentHostFilter or SameHostFilter, that
check set intersections of instances running on a particular host and
the ones passed as a hint for nova-scheduler in a boot request.

IronicHostManager should use the method implementation of the base
class for non-ironic compute nodes.

This is a partial fix which only modifies _get_instance_info() called
down the select_destinations() stack. A following change will modify
_init_instance_info() that pre-populates node instances info on start
of a nova-scheduler process.

libvirt will report ""Selecting disks to migrate is not

with VIR_MIGRATE_TUNNELLED flag.

This patch does 2 changes:

1. Raise exception.MigrationPreCheckError if block live migration with
   with mapped volumes and tunnelled flag on.
2. Remove migrate_disks from params of migrateToURI3 in case of
   tunnelled block live migration w/o mapped volumes since we want
   to copy all disks to destination
