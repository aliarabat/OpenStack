Currently with KillMode=none, if podman -t hangs, the command repeats
leaving the process and its cgroup around.
But if a stop/start command hangs, we should not start another one.

Instead time it out properly via TimeoutStopSec set to the 2x of
the timeout given to the managed podman action. Then if it expires,
kill its cgroup all the way (KillMode=control-group is a default)
before rerunning the same operation. Also note that using KilMode
process is not recommended by systemd man pages.

Increase the grace stop timeout defaults 10->42s to align it with:

In case of DVR-HA routers there was additional issue with that as
L3 agent tried to update MTU for the qr- interface in the
self.ha_namespace which, for DVR-HA routers is snat namespace.

This patch fixes that issue by setting MTU on the qr- interface in

Some firmware seems to take an objection with EFI nvram
entries being deleted after one is added, resulting in the
entire entry table being reset to the last known good state.

This is problematic, as ultimately deployments can time out
if we previously booted with Networking, and the machine, while
commanded to do other wise, reboots back to networking regardless.

We will now delete entries first, before proceeding.

Additionally, for general use, this pattern may serve the
community better by avoiding cases where we would have
previously just relied upon efibootmgr[0] to warn us of duplicate
entries.

nodejs is a dependency of novnc in EL8, so it gets installed in the

This patch removes the client-ceph-config job which was intended to
update the ceph-client-etc configmap with the mon_host IP addresses
so that ceph pods would get the IP address configuration when they
startup. However, the strategy has changed to use a common Helm
toolkit method to do this from the startup script of the Ceph pods
which require to talk to Ceph monitors. So this job is no longer
needed.

The checkDNS deployment, however, is still needed, just in case
one of the Ceph monitor IP addresses change, the other pods will
be updated by the checkDNS pod within 5 minutes.

We discovered that two unit test cases added in
I0647bb8545c1464b521a1d866cf5ee674aea2eae cause errors like
  oslo_db.sqlalchemy.enginefacade.AlreadyStartedError:
  this TransactionFactory is already started

when the db tests run selectively with tox -e py38 nova.tests.unit.db
but does not cause errors if the whole unit test suit is run.

This error happened because our db code uses two global transaction
factory, one for the api DB and one for the main DB. There was a global
flag SESSION_CONFIGURED in our Database fixture that guarded against
double initialization of the factory. But the faulty test cases in
question do not use our Database fixture but use the
OpportunisticDBTestMixin from oslo_db. Obviously that fixture does not
know about our SESSION_CONFIGURED global. So if one of the offending
test case ran first in an executor then that initialized the
transaction factory globally and a later test that uses our Database
fixture tried to configure it again leading to the error. For some
unknown reason if these tests were run in the opposite order the faulty
re-initialization did not happen. Probably the OpportunisticDBTestMixin
was able to prevent that.

A previous patch already removed the global SESSION_CONFIGURED flag
from our fixture and replaced it with a per DB specific patch_factory
calls that allow resetting the state of the factory at the end of each
test case. This would already solve the current test case issue as only
our offending test cases would initialize the global factory without
cleanup and we have one test case per DB. So there would be no
interference. However if in the future we add similar test cases then
those can still interfere through the global factory.

So this patch fixes the two offending test case. Also it extends the
DatabasePoisonFixture used for the NoDbTestCase tesst. The poison now
detects if the test case starts any transaction factory.

This poison caught another offender test case,
test_db_sync_with_special_symbols_in_connection_string, that was marked
NoDb but actually using the database. It is now changed to declare
itself as a test that sets up the DB manually and also it is changed to
use the Database fixture instead of touching the global factory
directly.

This patch apply the following changes to the fixture to make the
intention clearer and remove some unnecessary complexity:

* the fixture does a lot of dynamic thing in its __init__, these are
  moved to setUp() instead to facilitate proper reset functionality of
  the fixture

* the caching and applying of the DB schema is made a explicit and
  moved to setUp() too

* the explicit reset() function is removed as it is probably
  unintentionally overwrote the Fixture.reset(). Now the Fixture can be
  properly reset by calling the Fixture.reset() which is by default
  implemented by calling cleanUp() and setUp()

guard against the reconfiguration of the DB context in each test as the
global transaction factory does not allow such reconfiguration. However
this global is error prone for multiple reasons:

 * there are tests that actually configure the factory outside of the
   fixture causing tests to interfere

 * we use one single global flag but we always have two separate
   Database fixture one for the api DB and one for the main DB. Still
   the fixture instantiated first will do the configuration of both
   DB factory.

This patch replaces the global with two individual oslo_db enginefacade
patch_factory() calls that allows patching and resetting the global
factory per test case.

Create VFs using udev rules are required for attaching
and removing PF from a VM. On a reboot, when udev rules
trigger VF creation script and when a VF is attached to
vfio-pci driver, some of the VFs on that PF are not
initialized properly, resulting in VF not found issue.
Though it looks like driver issue, this patch avoids
this scenarios by removing the nic-paritioned VF from
the udev rule, as when one of the VF is attached to host,
the PF cannot be used by the VM.

The function setUp_pf_stubs() was added in the vdpa patch:

Since there is a dependency on this API for the tests of this patch,
it has been added here

When Nova is asked to create an instance snapshot of an instance booting
from a volume using the imageCreate API it will make a request to Cinder
to snapshot the underlying volume. This request is asynchronus and
returns to Nova before the volume snapshot becomes available.

This can easily race other volume operations if callers did not wait for
the volume snapshot to become `available` and overall state of the
volume to return to `in-use`.

Bug #1908269 outlines an example of this race where
AttachVolumeMultiAttachTest.test_snapshot_volume_backed_multiattach
attempts to delete the overall volume while the earlier request to
snapshot the volume was still in progress leading to a failure.

This change simply introduces the use of the
wait_for_volume_resource_status waiter into the create_image_from_server
utility method when a volume snapshot is identified in the snapshot
image metadata for the instance. This should result in the volume
snapshot reaching `available` and volume returning to `in-use` before
the test attempts to cleanup both the instance and volume.

The DEFAULT_IMAGE_NAME variable is used to reference the name of the
default image in glance after it has been uploaded by devstack. It is
used both inside and outside of devstack for that purpose. However, when
configuring tempest there are some tests which also do image uploads and
need a filename for specifying which file they should upload into glance
for testing purposes. Previously we were just using DEFAULT_IMAGE_NAME
for both purposes, but this causes a conflict if the name of the image
we upload into glance does not have a file extension. So instead of
conflating the things this commit differentiates between them and adds a
new DEFAULT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME variable to use for this purpose.

This conflicts because there were several intermediate changes before
this was finished. This just skips to the end state. Additionally the
change id is removed because to get things working in the gate
consistently this needs to land in a very specific order. This can't be
done if the change-ids all match.

Currently the <service>::wsgi::apache::ssl parameters have inconsistent
default values. Some parameters default to true while the other default
to false.

Based on the following points, false is considered to be the more
reasonable default.
 - Usage of SSL is optional and is not always required
 - There are other methods(like load-balancer) to implement SSL
   termination
 - Enabling SSL doesn't work with the default values currently
   defined, and requires additional parameters like ssl_cert.
 - false is the default value defined in the base implementation in
   puppet-openstacklib.

This change is the preparation to change the default value, and
introduces a warning message to make users aware of the future change.

This patch clears up confusion resulting from both tripleo and
cinder creating ""default"" volume types. The quotes indicate subtle
differences in how the term is used, and how it causes confusion for
cloud users.

TripleO added support for configuring cinder's default volume type,
and later cinder itself added its own support for a default volume
type. The cinder project's motivation was to provide a volume type
for all volumes, even when cloud administrators hadn't defined one.
But from tripleo's perspective, cinder's volume type was redundant
because tripleo *does* define a default volume type.

The confusion for cloud users is that cinder chose ""__DEFAULT__"" for
the name of the volume type, and ""Default Volume Type"" for its
description. This is misleading because tripleo's CinderDefaultVolumeType
is the actual default volume type.

Clearing up the confusion depends on whether the overcloud is a green
field deployment where no volumes have been created, or a brown field
deployment where cinder's __DEFAULT__ type may be in use. If no volumes
exist then it's safe for tripleo to simply delete cinder's __DEFAULT__
type. Otherwise, the __DEFAULT__ type's description is updated so that
it indicates the actual default type is the one established by the
CinderDefaultVolumeType parameter.

Lastly, CinderDefaultVolumeType is now constrained to prevent it being
set to an empty string. That should never happen, so this is just a
safety net.

As set out in the governance repo for Xena CentOS 8 stream with py36 is
a supported platform and runtime for the release:

https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/runtimes/xena.html

As a result the Nova team want to run CentOS 8 stream based jobs within
the integrated-gate-compute template.

An additional tempest-full-py3-centos-8-stream job is added to Tempest's
check and gate queues to ensure coverage here.

Both jobs are given additional swap to workaround bug #1949606, a
behaviour change in QEMU >= 5.0.0 when using [libvirt]virt_type=qemu
that causes additional memory to be consumed by each running instance.

This workaround of additional swap will be removed in the future once
Nova is able to workaround this itself through a new libvirt domain
configurable.

When the nova-compute service starts, by default it attempts to
startup instance configuration states for aspects such as networking.
This is fine in most cases, and makes a lot of sense if the
nova-compute service is just managing virtual machines on a hypervisor.

This is done, one instance at a time.

However, when the compute driver is ironic, the networking is managed
as part of the physical machine lifecycle potentially all the way into
committed switch configurations. As such, there is no need to attempt
to call ``plug_vifs`` on every single instance managed by the
nova-compute process which is backed by Ironic.

Additionally, using ironic tends to manage far more physical machines
per nova-compute service instance then when when operating co-installed
with a hypervisor. Often this means a cluster of a thousand machines,
with three controllers, will see thousands of un-needed API calls upon
service start, which elongates the entire process and negatively
impacts operations.

In essence, nova.virt.ironic's plug_vifs call now does nothing,
and merely issues a debug LOG entry when called.

Setting new controller for bridge every time when neutron-ovs-agent
is restarted or is doing full-sync may cause some short data plane
connectivity loss and is not needed if same controller is already
configured for the bridge.
With this patch neutron-ovs-agent will first check if controller is
configured for the bridge and if it's the same as what should be
configured, it will skip setting it up.

With this patch also protocols added to the bridge will be first checked
if they aren't already there and only missing ones will be added if
necessary.

Setting of the connectivity mode and inactivity probe is
always performed as this don't cause connectivity issues and is cheap
so we can always ensure that those parameters are configured properly.

Currently we manage the pipeline parameter and puppet classes
separaterly, and this requires us to update both puppet and
tripleo-heat-templates to add any new pipeline in swift-proxy-server.

This change makes the puppet classes included automatically based on
the items listed in the pipeline parameter.

autopep8 is a code formating tool that makes python code pep8
compliant without changing everything. Unlike black it will
not radically change all code and the primary change to the
existing codebase is adding a new line after class level doc strings.

This change adds a new tox autopep8 env to manually run it on your
code before you submit a patch, it also adds autopep8 to pre-commit
so if you use pre-commit it will do it for you automatically.

This change runs autopep8 in diff mode with --exit-code in the pep8
tox env so it will fail if autopep8 would modify your code if run
in in-place mode. This allows use to gate on autopep8 not modifying
patches that are submited. This will ensure authorship of patches is
maintianed.

The intent of this change is to save the large amount of time we spend
on ensuring style guidlines are followed automatically to make it
simpler for both new and old contibutors to work on nova and save
time and effort for all involved.

Update converge is largely unnecessary now with
ephemeral Heat. There is no Heat stack to update,
so we are doing nothing more than executing a
standard deployment using Ansible. Removing
the requirement for update converge will simplify
the process and improve user experience by reducing
the time it takes to perform minor updates.

A continuation of [1] in which we are trying to reduce the dependency on
NovaServiceManager when interacting with cpu_dedicated_set and
cpu_shared_set.

This commit introduces two new configuration options:
 * whitebox_hardware.dedicated_cpus_per_numa
 * whitebox_hardware.shared_cpus_per_numa

These options describe the number of pCPUs alloacted to either shared or
dedicated sets for a given compute host. We are making the assumption
that although the pCPUs allocated to their respective sets may be
different on each compute host, the number of pCPUs allocated are the
same.

Commit also removes NSM from three of the four base emulator thread
testcases and reduces some of the complexity originally present in the
tests. Since vcpu_pin_set and cpu_dedicated_set are no longer
directly modified in the test, their respective child tests have been
removed leaving just the parent to covering scenarios based on the
deployment.

The similarity in the variable names for get and get_all slipped through
when we implemented project personas support for messages:

  https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/cinder/+/806631

As a result, oslo.policy thought the policy name was changing, but it's
not. This commit updates the policy deprecations to use the right
deprecation variables.

Some firmware seems to take an objection with EFI nvram
entries being deleted after one is added, resulting in the
entire entry table being reset to the last known good state.

This is problematic, as ultimately deployments can time out
if we previously booted with Networking, and the machine, while
commanded to do other wise, reboots back to networking regardless.

We will now delete entries first, before proceeding.

Additionally, for general use, this pattern may serve the
community better by avoiding cases where we would have
previously just relied upon efibootmgr[0] to warn us of duplicate
entries.

This reverts commit 89e321b7b5c88ab7cfab53103295774ca535f0df.

Reason for revert: The previous change require develper to install multiple spcific version python 
locally to run the test envs and it arbitrally pins lower constratins to the 
oldest python we support but lower contratis shoudl work with the newwst python we support too.
on fedora or other operating systems that ship with default python version that exceed our supported
versions test can be run with tox -e py38 if required.

similarly our updated constratins shoudl work with the older python.

It is useful to dislabe this parameter when cinder/cross_az_attach is

This patch switches using f-strings instead of regular ones in places
where pep8 was complaining about with error C0209.

It also updates some of the lower-constraints to align them with
Neutron's lower-constraints and to make ci job happy.

It also changes OVN_BRANCH from ""master"" to ""main"" as that was renamed
in the OVN repo some time ago.

There are currently workloads that do not support live-migration during
the upgrades process. Example workloads include guests with SR-IOV
ports, pci-passthrough, ovs+dpdk vhost ports, or cpu pinning. Nova would
also like to test the results of upgrades when a workload is not
migrated off a host and is left in place.

This commit checks a workloads metadata and takes the appropriate action
based on the data. I.e. it will live, cold, or not migrate based on the
metadata of the instance. If no meta-data is present on the instance
describing the workload action, it will default to live migration unless
compute_cold_evacuate is set, in which case it will default to cold
migration.

used very generic regex when creating the blacklists. This causes
conflicts with other tests[2] that are also using a similar pattern.

This patch changes the blacklist scenario tests to use the test name
in the regex to make it more unique and easier to trace for debugging.

To check the existance of a namespace, instead of listing the

directly checks the existence of the namespace directory, using
""os.path.exists"".

This check is faster than listing the whole directory and avoids

This patch clears up confusion resulting from both tripleo and
cinder creating ""default"" volume types. The quotes indicate subtle
differences in how the term is used, and how it causes confusion for
cloud users.

TripleO added support for configuring cinder's default volume type,
and later cinder itself added its own support for a default volume
type. The cinder project's motivation was to provide a volume type
for all volumes, even when cloud administrators hadn't defined one.
But from tripleo's perspective, cinder's volume type was redundant
because tripleo *does* define a default volume type.

The confusion for cloud users is that cinder chose ""__DEFAULT__"" for
the name of the volume type, and ""Default Volume Type"" for its
description. This is misleading because tripleo's CinderDefaultVolumeType
is the actual default volume type.

Clearing up the confusion depends on whether the overcloud is a green
field deployment where no volumes have been created, or a brown field
deployment where cinder's __DEFAULT__ type may be in use. If no volumes
exist then it's safe for tripleo to simply delete cinder's __DEFAULT__
type. Otherwise, the __DEFAULT__ type's description is updated so that
it indicates the actual default type is the one established by the
CinderDefaultVolumeType parameter.

Lastly, CinderDefaultVolumeType is now constrained to prevent it being
set to an empty string. That should never happen, so this is just a
safety net.

Add ping test for gateway IPs on all networks, to ensure
all gateways are reachable.

The releated Bugzilla reports an issue where some network
fabrics fail when using the current node ping test, which
pings the first node in each role. The fabric simply does
not forward traffic before the gateway has been pinged.

One can argue that the fabric in question is broken. However,
with the current implementation the first node in each role
actually ping tests only against it's own address? So adding
the test to ping the gateway addresses improves the validation
in general.

The NFS driver doesn't allow to delete snapshots in error state when
snapshot support is disable.

I'm facing some scenarios where snapshots are enabled then a snapshot
is created and after that then snapshots are disabled. This results
in error state snapshots that can't be deleted.  Another scenario is
- with nfs snapshot support disable from the beginning- the API layer
allows the snapshot to be created but the NFS driver sets the status
to ""error"" leaving the snapshot in the DB with error state.
Because of that, I have snapshots in error state that I'm not able
to delete.

The purpose of this fix allow deleting snapshots in error state.
It makes sense to block creating snapshots when snapshot support is
False. However, when deleting snapshot we don't want to block
attempts to delete a broken snapshot DB entry, which is necessary to
clean up a failed snapshot create.

One of the functionalities the dnf Ansible module misses is the single
disabling and disabling of DNF modules [0]. Currently only installation and
removal are supported.

The tripleo_dnf_stream module is based on the dnf.py Ansible core module [1]
(so it will be simpler to contribute with this functionality to upstream
Ansible core) and covers the enabling and disabling of one or multiple
MODULE:STREAM.

This functionality is required when performing a minor update, as we
need to make sure that a set of streams are enabled to provide with
the right packages [2]. In this situation, the installation of the
whole module is not really required as a full upgrade will run after.

The module uses the options name (MODULE:STREAM) and state:[disabled or
enabled]. Example:
    - name: Enable the container-tools:3.0
      tripleo_dnf_stream:
        - name: container-tools:3.0

This commit updates the default manila policies in
enable-secure-rbac.yaml to implement consistent support for project
personas (project-admin, project-member, and project-reader) with other
OpenStack services. The project-admin is still considered a system
administrator.

This behavior will change in future releases (likely Yoga) when we have
a community wide goal to finish system-scope adoption. At that point, we can
remove these overrides and use the defaults in manila, which adhere to system
and project personas and we'll get more functionality without these overrides.

The MAC_Binding table in the SB database may grow indefinitely (due
to a lack of an aging mechanism of its entries) and eventually
lead to OOM killers for neutron-server which maintains an in-memory
copy of the database.

In order to stop monitoring this table, this patch is invoking
the ovsdb-client tool to remove the entries associated to
Floating IPs that have just been detached. The execution of this
tool is really fast as it will just invoke a JSON-RPC transact command
which doesn't require downloading the database contents.

In a scale test, the memory consumption of neutron-server dropped
from 75GB to 7GB with this patch.

Closes-Bug: #1946318

(Manually cherry picked from Neutron f6c35527698119ee6f73a6a3613c9beebb563840)

Note: The functional test has been changed for this stable branch
because the update_tables() method from ovsdbapp is not availabie for
this version of networking-ovn. So I changed the functional test to
add the MAC_Binding entry via ovsdb-client instead of using ovsdbapp
to do so.

As with WS-Man iDRAC API setting boot device requires creating BIOS
job and there can be only 1 open job per subsystem present in iDRAC,
there is validation to check that the job queue is empty before
continuing setting boot device. This does not work well for cases when
using autoupdatescheduler that creates `Repository Update` job that
stays Scheduled until executed and then followed by new Scheduled
`Repository Update` job.

This patch allows non-BIOS jobs to be present in the queue when setting
boot device. This will still fail for cases when there are BIOS jobs
present. In such cases should consider moving to idrac-redfish that
does not create BIOS or any other job to set boot device.

Currently the <service>::wsgi::apache::ssl parameters have inconsistent
default values. Some parameters default to true while the other default
to false.

Based on the following points, false is considered to be the more
reasonable default.
 - Usage of SSL is optional and is not always required
 - There are other methods(like load-balancer) to implement SSL
   termination
 - Enabling SSL doesn't work with the default values currently
   defined, and requires additional parameters like ssl_cert.
 - false is the default value defined in the base implementation in
   puppet-openstacklib.

This change is the preparation to change the default value, and
introduces a warning message to make users aware of the future change.

run-tempest role, which is called multiple times with all
the possible combinations of the 3 tested backends

The final JUnitXML output summarizes the test results
for each of the tested combinations.

To check the existance of a namespace, instead of listing the
namespaces directory (by default ""/var/run/netns""), this patch
directly checks the existence of the namespace directory, using
""os.path.exists"".

This check is faster than listing the whole directory and avoids
timeout problems as reported in the related bug.

This configuration for pipeline.yaml is still valid for mitaka and
above, so adding this in.

The ceilometer-collector package is not available in newer openstack
releases, so basing this on QUEENS_SERVICES.

This should solve the custom requirement of pipeline moving forward.

Other fixes:
* Update test-requirements.txt for cffi and related pins.
* Update focal-xena bundle to fix memcached series bionic requirement.

Nova and QEMU[1] supports PCI devices with a PCI address that has 16 bit
domain. However there are hypervisors that reports PCI addresses with
32 bit domain. While today we cannot assign these to guests this should
not prevent the nova-compute service to start.

This patch changes the PCI manager to ignore such PCI devices.

Please note that this patch does not change fact that nova does not
allow specifying PCI addresses with 32bit domain in the
[pci]/passthrough_whitelist configuration. Such configuration is still
rejected at nova-compute service startup.

The 3PAR driver creates new SSH connection to the backend for each
operation (eg. create/delete volume).

There is a limit on maximum number of SSH connections from 3PAR
backend i.e 24 connections.

The problem is that when multiple concurrent operations are
performed, this limit gets reached & further operations get
errored out.

This patch performs two things:
[a] Instead of creating new session for each operation, an attempt is
made to reuse existing session for as most operations.
[b] Since WSAPI of 3PAR has evolved, wsapi (http/https) requests are
used; thus SSH connections are no longer required.

return True in that case since we should count that volume in quotas.

During resize, on the source host, in resize_instance(), the instance.host
and .node is updated to point to the destination host. This indicates to
the source host's resource tracker that the allocation of this instance
does not need to be tracked as an instance but as an outbound migration
instead. However for the source host's resource tracker to do that it,
needs to use the instance.old_flavor. Unfortunately the
instance.old_flavor is only set during finish_resize() on the
destination host. (resize_instance cast to the finish_resize). So it is
possible that a running resize_instance() set the instance.host to point
to the destination and then before the finish_resize could set the
old_flavor an update_available_resources periodic runs on the source
host. This causes that the allocation of this instance is not tracked as
an instance as the instance.host point to the destination but it is not
tracked as a migration either as the instance.old_flavor is not yet set.
So the allocation on the source host is simply dropped by the periodic
job.

When such migration is confirmed the confirm_resize() tries to drop
the same resource allocation again but fails as the pinned CPUs of the
instance already freed.

When such migration is reverted instead, then revert succeeds but the
source host resource allocation will not contain the resource allocation
of the instance until the next update_available_resources periodic runs
and corrects it.

This does not affect resources tracked exclusively in placement (e.g.
VCPU, MEMORY_MB, DISK_GB) but it does affect NUMA related resource that
are still tracked in the resource tracker (e.g. huge pages, pinned
CPUs).

This patch moves the instance.old_flavor setting to the source node to
the same transaction that sets the instance.host to point to the
destination host. Hence solving the race condition.

To check the existance of a namespace, instead of listing the
namespaces directory (by default ""/var/run/netns""), this patch
directly checks the existence of the namespace directory, using
""os.path.exists"".

This check is faster than listing the whole directory and avoids
timeout problems as reported in the related bug.

As of the Xena release, all the OpenStack services support at least a
project-admin, project-member, and project-reader. The project-admin is
an administrator that has total control over the deployment (this
behavior is currently in the process of being refactored into the
system-admin persona).

The project-member persona is anyone with the 'member' default role on
a project and they have the ability to create, update, delete, and read
resources within a project.

The project-reader persona is anyone with the 'reader' default role on a
project and they have the ability to read resources within a project.
They're not allowed to make writable changes to resources.

Both the project-member and project-reader personas adhere to tenancy
constraints, meaning they're not allowed to interact with resources that
belong to other projects.

These personas are implemented consistently across OpenStack services,
some of which are starting to implement support for system personas.
This change adds a template to configure each service to use these new,
common project personas.

The following patches will update the enable-secure-rbac.yaml
environment file to implement project personas, which will get tested in
featureset 10.

When upgrading from Queens to Train and changing major operating system
as well, we currently take great care in puppet tripleo to let any
remotes still running on Centos7 keep working while the control plane
has moved to new Centos8 and hence new pcmk/pcs versions.

Since pcs has changed how things authenticate with remotes, we need to
make sure that after an upgrade we reauthenticate any remotes with pcs.
Other wise any pcs operation involving a remote (scaleup) will fail with
an error like the following:

This is because the upgrade remotes have not been reauthenticated to
pcs (which basically means that the remote computes are not present in
/var/lib/pcsd/known-hosts). With this change we observe the following
during an FFU:

There is a lot of checking that we have to do to keep resources names
and IDs straight when using the SDK. OSC does this for us in the old
code and now we have to do it ourselves. What this means is we only
speed up compared to osc if we remember those values.

Speed up by shifting more of the keystone account creation into a script
so that these values can be remembered which should be faster than OSC.

The keystone setup of accounts and roles is taking up about 1/5 of
devstack's runtime. This change uses a small python script to get an
idea for whether or not replacing osc calls with simpler scripts will be
quicker.

The motiviation for this is osc is known to be slow due to pkg_resources
loading. We can check how much of this slowness is actually in that
pkg_resources loading or in our api calls by replacing osc with simple
direct api calls instead.

Chances are if we decide to go further down this route we'll want to
replace whole sections of stack.sh like:
https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack/src/commit/6aeaceb0c4ef078d028fb6605cac2a37444097d8/stack.sh#L1146-L1161
with a single script that can configure everything with the overhead of
one python process startup. That means this change is probably not worth
merging as is even if it functions but should give us dat.

When a compute node goes down and all instances on the compute node
are evacuated, allocation records about these instance are still left
in the source compute node until nova-compute service is again started
on the node. However if a compute node is completely broken, it is not
possible to start the service again.
In this situation deleting nova-compute service for the compute node
doesn't delete its resource provider record, and even if a user tries
to delete the resource provider, the delete request is rejected because
allocations are still left on that node.

This change ensures that remaining allocations left by successful
evacuations are cleared when deleting a nova-compute service, to avoid
any resource provider record left even if a compute node can't be
recovered. Migration records are still left in 'done' status to trigger
clean-up tasks in case the compute node is recovered later.

When Cinder orchestrates a volume migration between backends it
initially creates a temporary volume on the destination before calling
Nova to swap to that volume. When this is complete Nova calls back to
Cinder and the temporary volume on the destination is renamed to the
original volume UUID making the migration transparent to end users.

Previously Nova would not account for this within the connection_info
stahed when connecting the new volume and would continue to point to the
original UUID of the temporary volume. For most codepaths in Nova this
isn't an issue but when dealing with multiattach volumes the libvirt
driver has a specific path that uses this stored volume_id within the
connection_info when an attempt is made to detach the volume,
nova.virt.libvirt.LibvirtDriver._should_disconnect_target. In this case
this would lead to a failed lookup of the volume in Cinder and an
eventual 500 returned by Nova.

This change corrects this by ensuring any volume_id stashed in the
new connection_info we gather during a swap_volume is overwritten with
the correct id returned by the eventual call to Cinder's
os-migrate_volume_completion API [1].

With this patch neutron-ovs-agent will first check if controller is

configured, it will skip setting it up.

Currently the <service>::wsgi::apache::ssl parameters have inconsistent
default values. Some parameters default to true while the other default
to false.

Based on the following points, false is considered to be the more
reasonable default.
 - Usage of SSL is optional and is not always required
 - There are other methods(like load-balancer) to implement SSL
   termination
 - Enabling SSL doesn't work with the default values currently
   defined, and requires additional parameters like ssl_cert.
 - false is the default value defined in the base implementation in
   puppet-openstacklib.

This change is the preparation to change the default value, and
introduces a warning message to make users aware of the future change.

During resize, on the source host, in resize_instance(), the instance.host
and .node is updated to point to the destination host. This indicates to
the source host's resource tracker that the allocation of this instance
does not need to be tracked as an instance but as an outbound migration
instead. However for the source host's resource tracker to do that it,
needs to use the instance.old_flavor. Unfortunately the
instance.old_flavor is only set during finish_resize() on the
destination host. (resize_instance cast to the finish_resize). So it is
possible that a running resize_instance() set the instance.host to point
to the destination and then before the finish_resize could set the
old_flavor an update_available_resources periodic runs on the source
host. This causes that the allocation of this instance is not tracked as
an instance as the instance.host point to the destination but it is not
tracked as a migration either as the instance.old_flavor is not yet set.
So the allocation on the source host is simply dropped by the periodic
job.

When such migration is confirmed the confirm_resize() tries to drop
the same resource allocation again but fails as the pinned CPUs of the
instance already freed.

When such migration is reverted instead, then revert succeeds but the
source host resource allocation will not contain the resource allocation
of the instance until the next update_available_resources periodic runs
and corrects it.

This does not affect resources tracked exclusively in placement (e.g.
VCPU, MEMORY_MB, DISK_GB) but it does affect NUMA related resource that
are still tracked in the resource tracker (e.g. huge pages, pinned
CPUs).

This patch moves the instance.old_flavor setting to the source node to
the same transaction that sets the instance.host to point to the
destination host. Hence solving the race condition.

One of the functionalities the dnf Ansible module misses is the single
disabling and disabling of DNF modules [0]. Currently only installation and
removal are supported.

The tripleo_dnf_stream module is based on the dnf.py Ansible core module [1]
(so it will be simpler to contribute with this functionality to upstream
Ansible core) and covers the enabling and disabling of one or multiple
MODULE:STREAM.

This functionality is required when performing a minor update, as we
need to make sure that a set of streams are enabled to provide with
the right packages [2]. In this situation, the installation of the
whole module is not really required as a full upgrade will run after.

The module uses the options name (MODULE:STREAM) and state:[disabled or
enabled]. Example:
    - name: Enable the container-tools:3.0
      tripleo_dnf_stream:
        - name: container-tools:3.0
          state: enabled

When network's MTU is changed, Neutron sends notification about it
to the L3 agents. In case of DVR (and DVR HA) MTU is then changed in
the qrouter- namespace but should be also changed on snat interfaces
in the snat namespace. And that part was missing.

This patch adds special implementation of the internal_network_updated()
method in the DvrEdgeRouter class so it can configure MTU also for
in the snat namespace.

This patch also removed passing attributes ""interface_name"",
""ip_cidrs"" and ""mtu"" to the internal_network_updated() method and adds
""port"" dict to be passed there. It is consistent with what is already
done in e.g. internal_network_added() method and ""port"" dict is actually
necessary to configure properly snat internal interface in the snat
namespace.

This patch adds also functional test of update network mtu for all types
of routers as there was no such test at all.

There is additional issue with DVR-HA which isn't fixed with that patch
and for which follow up will be proposed. Because of that this patch is
marked as partial fix for the related bug.

When network's MTU is changed, Neutron sends notification about it
to the L3 agents. In case of DVR (and DVR HA) MTU is then changed in
the qrouter- namespace but should be also changed on snat interfaces
in the snat namespace. And that part was missing.

This patch adds special implementation of the internal_network_updated()
method in the DvrEdgeRouter class so it can configure MTU also for
in the snat namespace.

This patch also removed passing attributes ""interface_name"",
""ip_cidrs"" and ""mtu"" to the internal_network_updated() method and adds
""port"" dict to be passed there. It is consistent with what is already
done in e.g. internal_network_added() method and ""port"" dict is actually
necessary to configure properly snat internal interface in the snat
namespace.

This patch adds also functional test of update network mtu for all types
of routers as there was no such test at all.

There is additional issue with DVR-HA which isn't fixed with that patch
and for which follow up will be proposed. Because of that this patch is
marked as partial fix for the related bug.

This change implements all project personas (project-admin,

considered system-administrators using policy overrides.

This file was modified by generating the default sample policy file in
keystone:

  $ oslopolicy-sample-generator --namespace keystone

Then, working through the file to remove any system-specific checks
(e.g., role:admin and system_scope:all). After that, I used the
convert_policy_yaml_to_heat_template.py tool to update the existing
enable-secure-rbac.yaml file, resulting in a diff of the original
defaults, hopefully making it easier for reviews to see what exactly is

Currently the <service>::wsgi::apache::ssl parameters have inconsistent
default values. Some parameters default to true while the other default
to false.

Based on the following points, false is considered to be the more
reasonable default.
 - Usage of SSL is optional and is not always required
 - There are other methods(like load-balancer) to implement SSL
   termination
 - Enabling SSL doesn't work with the default values currently
   defined, and requires additional parameters like ssl_cert.
 - false is the default value defined in the base implementation in
   puppet-openstacklib.

This change is the preparation to change the default value, and
introduces a warning message to make users aware of the future change.

The key parameter of swift backend is used to define a credentail to
access Swift so should be hidden in logs.

In Glance the user parameter(swift_store_user) is also defined as
a secret parameter. However it defines user name or id and user name
or id is not currently treated as secret in puppet, so this change
doesn't cover the user parameter.

Just passing kubernetes_API exceptions is not enough, all are more appropriate.

In out functional tests we run nova services as eventlets. Also those
services can spawn there own eventlets for RPC or other parallel
processing. The test case executor only sees and tracks the main
eventlet where the code of the test case is running. When that is
finishes the test executor considers the test case to be finished
regardless of the other spawned eventlets. This could lead to leaked
eventlets that are running in parallel with later test cases.

One way that it can cause trouble is via the global variables in
nova.rpc module. Those globals are re-initialized for each test case so
they are not directly leaking information between test cases. However if
a late eventlet calls nova.rpc.get_versioned_notifier() it will get a
totally usable FakeVersionedNotifier object regardless of which test
case this notifier is belongs to or which test case the eventlet belongs
to. This way the late eventlet can send a notification to the currently
running test case and therefore can make it fail.

The current case we saw is the following:

1) The test case
  nova.tests.functional.test_servers.ServersTestV219.test_description_errors
  creates a server but don't wait for it to reach terminal state (ACTIVE
  / ERROR). This test case finishes quickly but leaks running eventlets
  in the background waiting for some RPC call to return.
2) As the test case finished the cleanup code deletes the test case
   specific setup, including the DB.
3) The test executor moves forward and starts running another test case
4) 60 seconds later the leaked eventlet times out waiting for the RPC
   call to return and tries doing things, but fails as the DB is already
   gone. Then it tries to  report this as an error notification. It calls
   nova.rpc.get_versioned_notifier() and gets a fresh notifier that is
   connected to the currently running test case. Then emits the error
   notification there.
5) The currently running test case also waits for an error notification
   to be triggered by the currently running test code. But it gets the
   notification form the late eventlet first. As the content of the
   notification does not match with the expectations the currently
   running test case fails. The late eventlet prints a lot of
   error about the DB being gone making the troubleshooting pretty hard.

This patch proposes a way to fix this by marking each eventlet at spawn
time with the id of the test case that was directly or indirectly
started it.

Then when the NotificationFixture gets a notification it compares the
test case id stored in the calling eventlet with the id of the test case
initialized the NotificationFixture. If the two ids do not match then
the fixture ignores the notification and raises an exception to the
caller eventlet to make it terminate.

full url with egg specifier. The egg specifer isn't necessary and
neither is the url and simpler is easier to understand.

We also add the verbose flag to the pip installations of tools into that
virtualenv to better understand problems when they occur.

Finally we add the option to skip writing package files if their
contents are empty. This allows us to ensure that we can omit certain
files which will be useful for the next change.

The patch I03cf285ad83e09d88cdb702a88dfed53c01610f8 fixed most of the
possible cases for this to happen but missed one. An early enough
exception during _delete() can cause that the instance_uuid never gets
defined but then we try to use it during the finally block. This patch
moves the saving of the instance_uuid to the top of the try block to
avoid the issue.
