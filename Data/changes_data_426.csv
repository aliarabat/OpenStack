We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that

When os-net-config configures the network configuration on the overcloud nodes
ssh connections can be dropped.

Since we have ssh retries set to 8 in ansible.cfg, ansible would retry the task
since it was failed by a ssh connection error.

However, the first task was actually still running and it eventually succeeds.

The second task that was kicked off by ansible as a retry, sees that the
deployment is already applied, but the notification file (*.notify.json) does
not yet exist since the first task is still in progress. This causes the second
task to fail with the error reported in the bug and the whole ansible-playbook
run to then fail.

Setting ServerAliveInterval and ServerAliveCountMax ssh options seems to fix
the issue as ssh doesn't drop the first connection when these are configured.

This change adds a fast retry loop around
AllocationList._set_allocations if a resource provider generation
conflict happens. It turns out that under high concurrency of allocation
claims being made on the same resource provider conflicts can be quite
common and client side retries are insufficient.

Because both consumer generation and resource provider generations had
raised the same exception there was no way to distinguish between the
two so a child of ConcurrentUpdateDetected has been created as
ResourceProviderConcurrentUpdateDetected. In the future this will allow
us to send different error codes to the client as well, but that change
is not done here.

When the conflict is detected, all the resource providers in the
AllocationList are reloaded and the list objects refreshed.

Logging is provided to indicate:

* at debug that a retry is going to happen
* at warning that all the retries failed and the client is going to
  see the conflict

The tests for this are a bit funky: Some mocks are used to cause the
conflicts, then the real actions after a couple of iterations.

This was backported from 72e4c4c8d7fb146862b899337626485dad10f15b with
conflicts because exceptions, tests and object files were moved to
new locations with Rocky and the AllocationList.create_all method was
renamed to the more accurate replace_all. Prior to Rocky there were
no Consumer objects and fewer helper methods in functional tests,
so the test is adjusted accordingly.

The backport from queens to pike conflicted on a different docstring on
the set_allocations method. The docstring from queens was maintained as
the info it contains remains true and useful.

The backport from pike to ocata confliced on the name of a context
variable in the test. The modern version was ctx. The older tests
expect context. Also, the method _set_allocations is a static method
in ocata, so the mock in the include test did not need to be a
functools.partial.

This change adds a fast retry loop around
AllocationList._set_allocations if a resource provider generation
conflict happens. It turns out that under high concurrency of allocation
claims being made on the same resource provider conflicts can be quite
common and client side retries are insufficient.

Because both consumer generation and resource provider generations had
raised the same exception there was no way to distinguish between the
two so a child of ConcurrentUpdateDetected has been created as
ResourceProviderConcurrentUpdateDetected. In the future this will allow
us to send different error codes to the client as well, but that change
is not done here.

When the conflict is detected, all the resource providers in the
AllocationList are reloaded and the list objects refreshed.

Logging is provided to indicate:

* at debug that a retry is going to happen
* at warning that all the retries failed and the client is going to
  see the conflict

The tests for this are a bit funky: Some mocks are used to cause the
conflicts, then the real actions after a couple of iterations.

This was backported from 72e4c4c8d7fb146862b899337626485dad10f15b with
conflicts because exceptions, tests and object files were moved to
new locations with Rocky and the AllocationList.create_all method was
renamed to the more accurate replace_all. Prior to Rocky there were
no Consumer objects and fewer helper methods in functional tests,
so the test is adjusted accordingly.

The backport from queens to pike conflicted on a different docstring on
the set_allocations method. The docstring from queens was maintained as
the info it contains remains true and useful.

Also, add tox-linters job to gate so that changes like this can merge.

By spliting them up, we can now start Octavia without going through the
extra initialization steps, which are not idempotent (or meant to be
anyway), exiting with error code and preventing from continuing the
so desired start process of Octavia. The split-up will allow Grenade to
call out octavia_start solely for the purpose of starting Octavia
services.

This patch also fixes awk from matching itself when stopping Octavia.
This keeps awk from showing itself in the output, grabbing only relevant
PIDs. Otherwise awk PID is added to PID list resulting in kill command
exiting with error as awk is no longer running. This is equially
important and required grenading Octavia, else an exit error would be
thrown.

want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that

attachments for volumes that are in available or downloading state. We
intend to allow multiple attachments when multi-attach is ready to

we're not enabling that.

In order to allow Nova to continue to do things like live-migration
which is really a special case of multi-attach we'll add an instance
uuid check that allows this flow to continue until we fully turn on
multi-attach.

Just check on the _attachment_reserve, if there's an instance_uuid

This is required to ensure VIP's are present in case the

the network interface. When containerizing the undercloud

This change adds a similar workaround. A pre_deploy

Additional argument to be able to customize the ERL command line
arguments. This allows the operator to specify some arguments to the
Erlang VM. By default we are now passing '+sbwt none' to set the
the erlang scheduler busy wait threshold. This threshold determines how
long schedulers are to busy wait when running out of work before going
to sleep. On most of our deployments where rabbitmq shares a node with
a lot of other services it makes little sense to busy wait when out of
work in order to improve latency as other processes are more likely to
fail to do work due to CPUs being overused by rabbit,

We have measured a three-fold reduction of CPU usage with this option
with no other observable impact.

We can observe the change in the beam.smp params:

For multi-node builds, we previously shut down the keystone_admin-back

This back-end no longer exists, and the second loop does not use loop
control to ensure that the common tasks 'item' and the playbook 'item'

By default the list of files that compare is:
- playbook_executions.log
- reproducer-quickstart.sh
- collect_logs.sh

An example of execution would be ""./compare-reviews.py 584508  589068""
It will compare the CI artifacts stated before between the two reviews.

The output is a diff with the differences, for each file at each job.

This reverts commit 0dc0db932e3ad5ad911f2072015cb9854f6e4e23.

The original change caused our host state processing to be inconsistent
with our own hypervisors API. Automation tooling that used our API
to add hosts to aggregates would fail silently. We are reverting
this and will propose a check on the aggregate host add action
which will confirm the case-sensitive mapping of the host being
added, which is what we should have done in the first place.

Our Vagrantfile is rsync'ing the role to /vagrant. This breaks the
role test since the $WORKING_DIR no longer matches the name of the
OSA project. As such, when we are using vagrant to test the plugins
tests and ops repositories we end up using the HEAD of the repositories
instead of our local copy. We fix this by introducing a new
OSA_PROJECT_NAME and then we test against this to determine the actual

CentOS tests have reverted to using upstream for EPEL rather than
local mirrors, introducing some unnecessary instability.  The root of
the problem is that /etc/nodepool/provider disappeared with zuulv3, so
we now always re-install the EPEL repo and overwrite the local EPEL
.repos files that were made during test setup and point to local
mirrors.

The other change is that we stopped installing the RDO repositories on
the testing nodes too.  That we were incorrectly taking this path and
reinstalling EPEL has hidden the removal of these packages from the
base image in the test, since it ends up installing them too.

Split the install into two parts -- epel and RDO.  Check for
/etc/ci/mirror_info.sh (the sourcable mirror script provided by base
test setup) and if so, just enable EPEL so we get the CI-mirror
version correctly.  Install the RDO repositories (if not already
installed) unconditionally.

The port delete events are not synchronized with network rpc events.  This
creates a condition which makes it possible for a port delete event to be
processed just before a previously started network query completes.

The problematic order of operations is as follows:

  1) a network is scheduled to an agent; a network rpc is sent to the
     agent

  2) the agent queries the network data from the server

  3) while that query is in progress a port on that network is deleted; a
     port rpc is sent to the agent

  4) that port delete rpc is received before the network query rpc
     completes

  5) the port delete results in no action because the port was not present
     on the agent

  6) the network query finishes and adds the port to the cache (even
     though the port has already been deleted)

  7) some time passes and a new port is configured with the same IP
     address as the port that was deleted in (3)

  8) the dhcp host file is corrupted with 2 entries for the same IP
     address.

  9) dhcp queries for the newest port is rejected because of the duplicate
     entry in the dhcp host file.

The solution is to add the network_id to the port_delete_end rpc event
so that the _net_lock(network_id) synchronization point can be acquired
so that it is processed serially with other network related events.

To ensure backwards compatibility with newer agents running against older
servers the determination of which network_id value to use in the lock is
handled using a utility that will fallback to the previous mode of operation
whenever the network_id attribute is not present in the *_delete_end RPC
events.  That utility can be removed in the future when it is guaranteed
that the network_id attribute will be present in RPC messages from the
server.

When a mock hasn't been provided with a long-enough list of side-effects
for the number of times it is called, it raises StopIteration (instead
of something sensible like AssertionError). Prior to Python 3.7, this
exception could bubble up until it just stopped a task. (In Python 3.7
it will eventually be caught and turned into a RuntimeError.)

To ensure that any errors of this sort are not handled silently, and to
enable us to test for them prior to using Python 3.7, catch any
StopIteration errors coming from plugin-provided non-generator functions
and convert them to RuntimeError exceptions.

This reveals many errors in the unit tests, which are also fixed by this
patch. This backport contains fewer fixes than master, because many of
the errors were introduced in the process of moving from mox to mock in
the Rocky release cycle.

With this commit, each storage policy can define the diskfile to use to
access objects. Selection of the diskfile is done in swift.conf.

Example:
    [storage-policy:0]
    name = gold
    policy_type = replication
    default = yes
    diskfile = egg:swift#replication.fs

The diskfile configuration item accepts the same format than middlewares
declaration: [[scheme:]egg_name#]entry_point
The egg_name is optional and default to ""swift"". The scheme is optional
and default to the only valid value ""egg"". The upstream entry points are
""replication.fs"" and ""erasure_coding.fs"".

Change Ib0ec1012b74e9a9e74c8879f3feed5f9332b711f introduced
a new VirtDriverNotReady exception which the ironic driver raises
when asked to retrieve a list of nodes and ironic-api is not
available, like if nova-compute is started before ironic-api.
This is normal and meant to be self-healing, but we can get it
in other periodic tasks besides update_available_resource which
leads to ugly exception traces on startup in the logs. This adds
handling for the exception in the _sync_power_states periodic
task.

Previously the image virt type was qemu and the compute node virt
type was kvm. This works for deployments prior to rocky but in
rocky this causes the image type filter to return no valid hosts.
An update to charmhelpers has removed the default behaviour of
setting the virt type to 'qemu' by default.

Due to a bug in icehouse updating glance image properties using
the v2 api fails (See Bug #1371559) so for icehouse deploys
get a v1 client.

This patch set corrects some misleading documentation under ""Unit
Tests"" section in REVIEWING.rst.

It currently claims that service clients do not require unit test
coverage -- but this is false. This is because Tempest now places
all of its service clients in tempest.lib. And as per
https://docs.openstack.org/tempest/latest/library.html#testing it
is required to add unit tests for all service client interfaces.

Thus this makes the documentation language clear that service clients
require unit tests.

instance delete in the happy case when the instance is scheduled to a

action is executed. If the instance is never scheduled to a compute or
the compute is not available when the instance is deleted legacy delete
notifications are emitted from different places, compute.api instead of

Often time ambari fails during cluster installation/service
starting stage. This is quiet prominent when  there is
a large number of nodes in the cluster. Review of the
logs from the cluster indicates that ambari installation
scripts has a timeout parameter set to 1800 sec, this
requires adjustment depending on the environment and
speed of package installation.

This fix provides one parameter named
""agent.package.install.task.timeout""  inside the Ambari tab
of the HDP cluster template UI . User may change the
values and accordingly the ambari server will be setup
for package installation timeout.'

Attempting to restore a replicated volume to snapshot will result in an
error, as this operation requires the RDF relationship to be suspended
first. It would be safest to throw an exception and block this operation
on replicated volumes. The user could instead create a new volume from
the snapshot and attach that, instead of reverting the original volume.
This patch implements this change.

As part of the Denver PTG [1] we decided networking related projects
that are ""current"" and want to receive neutron-lib consumption patches
on an on-going basis should indicate such with a well defined comment
in their requirements.txt. This allows us to easily find the list of
project to receive neutron-lib consumption patches [2] by searching for
the string.

In addition, projects opting-in for these patches are also attesting
they will stay up to date with TC and infra initiatives to ensure
consumption patches can flow freely.

This patch adds the ""neutron-lib-current"" string to requirements.txt
opting in for neutron-lib consumption patches.

TIMEOUT_SCALING_FACTOR to the timeout. Whoops.

Also, turn off keepalive in the underlying session. For devstack
functional tests, we're seeing a lot of ""Resetting dropped connection""
so I'm thinking we should just disable that.

Also, increase the individual test timeout, and bump the scaling factor
on trunk tests, which always seem to be timing out.

Commit 6b9464e91840f6e006f537dcd3c0f656ae90a179 sets the backend
volume ID to Cinder volume ID so that we can use vCenter SearchIndex
API to query backend volumes by Cinder volume ID.

This patch uses SearchIndex API to improve scalability. But this type
of querying will not work for legacy volumes whose vCenter ID is not
set to Cinder volume ID. To handle those volumes, we build a cache to
map their names to vCenter references during driver setup.

Attaching SR-IOV ports to existing instances is not supported
since the compute service does not perform any kind of PCI
device allocation, so we should fail fast with a clear error
if attempted. Note that the compute RPC API ""attach_interface""
method is an RPC call from nova-api to nova-compute so the error
raised here will result in a 400 response to the user.

Blueprint sriov-interface-attach-detach would need to be
implemented to support this use case, and could arguably involve
a microversion to indicate when the feature was made available.

A related neutron docs patch https://review.openstack.org/594325
is posted for mentioning the limitation with SR-IOV port attach
as well.

It turns out that in environments with a big number of VMs, sometimes
the neutron dhcp agent fails to read the dhcp lease file because some
lines with the ipv4/ipv6 entries don't have enough fields and causes the
dhcp agent to fail.

When this happens the agent calls sync_state to
fully resync the agent state, that causes a serious performance problems
in scale environments.

We need to be more robust reading the file to handle these exceptions.

This patch changes the scheduler report client
remove_provider_from_instance_allocation function to use placement API
microversion 1.28 that includes consumer generation handling. If
placement returns 409 conflict remove_provider_from_instance_allocation
returns False in the same way as in case of other non 204 results.

There are plenty of places in nova calling
remove_provider_from_instance_allocation:
* dropping allocation on the destination of a live migrate if pre check
  fails
* compute host startup deletes allocation of an instance that was
  successfully evacuated from the host while it was down
* rebuild fails on the destination of an evacuation and therefore
  the allocation on the destination is deleted
* pre resize fails therefore allocation on the destination is deleted

This patch does not change the external behavior of
remove_provider_from_instance_allocation as it still returns False in
caes of failure. Therefore this patch does not introduce new functional
test for the above cases but rely on the existing coverage. However based
on the other patches in this series the error handling in these cases
is suspected to be imperfect.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements

Notes on refactor:
  * removing usage of non_domain_enabled_user so that I can run the

  * removing alt_email as os_primary's user does not have the email

Warning on test completeness:
  * I realize some of these tests are intended to check for exclusion of
    certain users in the user list which is now lost due to the removal
    of the non_domain_enabled_user.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

If you have a subnet with 2 routers and you create and then delete
a VM it may happen that an old ARP entry may persist. If you create
another VM with the same IP and the arp update goes to the other

ARP entry is wrong.

This is a very simple view as it does an upgrade from N->N, so maybe
it's still POC.  Next iteration should strive to get N-1->N upgrade
but that will requires:
 1. new featureset (to tell tripleo that it should install standalone
   N-1);
 2. new logic in tripleo-ci to setup standalone N-1;
 3. make sure new containers are pulled and hypervisor is yum upgraded;
 4. run the tripleo upgrade command;

This also add ansible lint of the generated playbooks in the usual
standalone job.

Sardonic is a hardware inventory system; not quite a CMDB, but a high
quality data source for input into a CMDB.

The idea for sardonic came out of some conversations between Oath and
CERN, and we wrote up a document describing some of the use cases,
requirements, and other random thoughts:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/144g8E_fzGD4WZzMvswkeowzcILL4hxg4QDS-46KYCcQ/edit
(apologies for the google doc - this will likely become a document
within sardonic's documentation)

This was presented to the ironic team during the Stein PTG, and folks
were generally receptive to the idea. Some people from Red Hat and Dell
were also interested in contributing, and we decided the next steps
would be to spin up a repository in the OpenStack infrastructure.

The long-term goal is for sardonic to integrate with ironic, and
potentially other projects that deal with hardware (directly or
indirectly), like Nova or Neutron.

It's unclear if sardonic should be managed within the Ironic project, as
a separate official OpenStack project, or remain unofficial; so we treat
it as if it will eventually be official to reduce friction as much as
possible.

This patch ignore the server when server_id can't be found in the stack

A warning is shown so the operator knows this server isn't part of the

If getting the server name fails for another reason than a KeyError,
we fail the configuration generation and raise an exception with the

When the current code needs the repo checked out to a specific commit it
calls clone_repo. The clone_repo call makes sure the repo has been
cloned locally, performs a fetch to get all tags and prunes any
references no longer on the remote, then finally checks out the
requested ref.

The validation logic starts with cloning all necessary repos and
performing these actions, so after that point, we should be able to just
checkout the ref that we need for the given check. This will greatly
improve the execution time of the validate job for repos that have had a
large number of releases.

In order to support cases where pools and keys are pre-created and
ceph-proxy just proxies this data to client applications this change
introduces support for:

* having custom ""admin"" users which may not actually have admin
privileges on the target cluster (client.admin is probably occupied by
real admins in this case);
* using cephx keys provided via charm config.

As part of the Denver PTG [1] we decided networking related projects
that are ""current"" and want to receive neutron-lib consumption patches
on an on-going basis should indicate such with a well defined comment
in their requirements.txt. This allows us to easily find the list of
project to receive neutron-lib consumption patches [2] by searching for
the string.

In addition, projects opting-in for these patches are also attesting
they will stay up to date with TC and infra initiatives to ensure
consumption patches can flow freely.

This patch adds the ""neutron-lib-current"" string to requirements.txt
opting in for neutron-lib consumption patches.

One of the requirements of the online data migration command is that
they must be able to be run without any Cinder service running in order
to support a normal upgrade or a Fast-Forward upgrade.

With the introduction of the shared_targets feature we added an online
migration that requires the Cinder services to be running (it does RPC
calls).

To prevent this from happening again this patch adds a comment right
above the online_migrations tupple as a reminder for reviewers.

section of the service configuration. This ensures that oslo.messaging
notifications use the correct transport for deployments that have
separate rpc and notify messaging backends.

This patch conditionally selects the notifier driver for when

Recently, there is a change[1] in Octavia which adding new validation
to forbid using HTTP method, expectation code and URL path for non-HTTP
type health monitor. For example, if user is using TCP as the type of
health monitor and now Heat is using default values for HTTP_METHOD,
EXPECTED_CODES and URL_PATH, which will cause error response from Octavia.
And the stack creation will fail. This patch fixes it by removing those
default values.

The way in which this check counted compute nodes was
broken because of an incorrect for/else condition. If
the check is run with a nova.conf like we have in
devstack, where the API database is configured but
the [database]/connection is pointing at cell0, where
there are no compute nodes, the check passes saying
there are no compute nodes even if the are compute
nodes found in the cell databases (in the for loop).
This is because the else executes because the for loop
doesn't break, and then _count_compute_nodes returns 0
for cell0 and overwrites the num_computes variable.

This fixes the issue by checking if we have cell mappings
before running the loop, else we hit the else block as
was originally intended.

Previously we were not checking the status of created VMs in CI, meaning
that VM creation failures would be silently ignored. This change checks
the status, requiring it to be ACTIVE for a pass.

When running stress tests against the Octavia Health Manager it was
observed that the scalability and performance of the health manager has
degraded.
It was observed that the ORM layer was forming poorly optimized queries,
putting excessive load on the database engine and unnecessary code paths
were executing for each heartbeat message.
This patch optimizes the health manager processing of amphora-agent
heartbeat messages by optimizing the database requests, pool processing,
and event streamer code paths.

Placement has always relied heavily on functional testing for both API
and database testing, so not including those tests in 'coverage' leads
to misleading results.

This change adjusts the cover job in tox to use a test path of
placement/tests, resulting in all the tests running.

In the process .coveragerc is updated to be placement oriented
and make sure we do not ignore branches.

This is in preparation for turning on a check job for coverage.
See this email for more on that:

http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2018-September/134385.html

A followup patch will turn on a check job for it.

Use of the fixture is a  bit more clean and correct and 'placement'
is the policy we want.

Also, reset() the loaded policy between tests so that global
state is reset. This ought to avoid race conditions in tests.

This reverts commit 19e7cf09d9a9aa4730faca3f3cc506fed0cb454e.

The issues in OVH BHS1 around networking configuration have been worked
around with updates to glean and configuration to the labels in zuul.
New images are in place for each supported image in BHS1. We can go
ahead and start using this region again.

I have manually tested this by booting an ubuntu-xenial node with
glean_ignore_interfaces='True' set in metadata and the networking comes
up with expected using DHCP. The mirror in that region is reachable from
this test node.

Several operations (e.g. stack check) are yet to be converted to
convergence-style workflows, and still create locks. While we try to always
remove dead locks, it's possible that if one of these gets left behind we
won't notice, since convergence doesn't actually use stack locks for most
regular operations.

When doing _check_status_complete() on a nested stack resource, we wait for
the operation to release the nested stack's lock before reporting the
resource completed, to ensure that for legacy operations the nested stack
is ready to perform another action on as soon as the resource is complete.
For convergence stacks this is an unnecessary DB call, and it can lead to
resources never completing if a stray lock happens to be left in the
database.

Only check the nested stack's stack lock for operations where we are not
taking a resource lock. This corresponds exactly to legacy-style
operations.

Monasca uses Kafka messaging version 0.9 which is not supported by
Logstash 5.x with the default Kafka input/output plugins. An attempt
to downgrade the plugins to the 4.x series which should be compatible
with messaging version 0.9 and Logstash 5.x failed. Therefore, until
Monasca is upgraded (work is ongoing) this patch downgrades
Logstash to 2.4.1.

Although it would have been simpler to perform the downgrade by
blacklisting the Logstash 5.x package which is provided as part of the
official ELK repo and installing the official repo for Logstash 2.4.1,
Ubuntu 18.04 no longer accepts SHA1 hashes (for good reason) and will
not install Logstash 2.4.1 from this repo (fails with GPG error).
This approach does however work for Centos, but for consistency it
was not used.

This change therefore modifies the Logstash dockerfile, and directly
downloads and installs the Logstash 2.4.1 package. It should be
reverted as soon as Monasca is upgraded.

It is possible for volumes, created from storage pools
which have zero-padding disabled, to contain previous data. This
change prevents these volumes from being created by default. A
user can override this behavior by acknowleding the possibility
with a configuration option.

This is a squash of the four commits that led to the final state in
rocky to not allow the creation of any type of non-zero-padded volumes
to be created. This adds a config option that defaults to the safe
behavior. It is backporting a new config option, and a change in default
behavior, but it should be acceptable in this case so that the security
vulnerability can be addressed.

The placement API version 1.28 introduced consumer generation as a way
to make updating allocation safe even if it is done from multiple
places.

This patch changes delete_allocation_for_instance to use PUT
/allocations instead of DELETE /allocations to benefit from the consumer
generation handling.

In this patch the report client will GET the current allocation of the
instance including the consumer generation and then try to PUT an empty
allocation with that generation. If this fails due to a consumer
generation conflict, meaning something modified the allocation of the
instance in between GET and PUT then the report client will raise
AllocationDeleteFailed exception. This will cause that the instance
goes to ERROR state.

This patch only detects a small portion of possible cases when
allocation is modified outside of the delete code path. The rest can
only be detected if nova would cache at least the consumer generation
of the instance.

To be able to put the instance state to ERROR the instance.destroy()
call is moved to the end to of the deletion call path. To keep the
instance.delete.end notification behavior consistent with this move
(e.g. deleted_at field is filled) the notification sending needed to
be moved too.

... to allow usage of host vars and group vars by looping the part of
the play that reifies the VM templates over pxe_servers rather than
vm_hosts. Instead of looping over pxe_servers hosts on each task, loop
over and delegate to vm_hosts on each task.

What this makes possible is the definition of default_vm_storage on a
per-host basis. The specific use case I have in mind is to allocate a
larger share of VG space to compute nodes without artificially limiting
how much space the compute nodes can have by bloating every other VM
in proportion.
