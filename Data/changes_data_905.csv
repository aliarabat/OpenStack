Network owner should be able to get all ports and delete ports on
network as policy allowed. But current code fails to support this.

Current model query for Port is still based on tenant_id, it forgets
to check for network owner when context tenant_id is not port owner.

For port_delete action, policy will generate checking rules for port
attributes, such as:
    rule:delete_port:binding:vif_details
    rule:delete_port:binding:vif_type
This doesn't make sense, only single policy rule ""rule:delete_port""
is enough to check.

This patch fixes this issue.

Separate files have been created for vars and tasks related to a
specific package manager.

The 'repo_apt_packages' variable has been deprecated and renamed to
the more generalized 'repo_server_packages' to better describe its
purpose and to simplify reuse of existing install tasks between multiple
distros.

git daemon is configured to host git repositories from the repo servers
using the git protocol.

Currently, openstack-ansible uses git over http to access repositories
on servers created by this role.
fcgiwrap and its configuration within nginx should be removed in a
follow-up patch after openstack-ansible has been updated to use the git
protocol.

****
While this looks like a big patch, its actually a relatively small
change to the default rsync script. I understand that Kilo is pre EOL,
but this is an isolated change and removes one more potential way
that a juno-kilo upgrade could go wrong.
****

Commit message from original master patch:

Currently there is a race between the repo servers syncing and the first
role that attempts to install a pip package. This change ensures that
only the primary repo server is accessible until the slaves are synced.

This is achieved by adding a hook into lsyncd that allows a command to
be run before and after each sync. This command is an ssh command to
connect to the relevant secondary container and stop/start nginx. As the
nginx user is unprivileged, a sudoers file is added to allow nginx to be
stopped and started.

Notes on adding the hook into lsyncd:
 * There is an existing script in lsyncd/examples for postcmd. This
   works at a higher level by adding an event onto the stack for
   executing a command once the sync has finished. I experimented with
   that but events dont get fired for the initial recursive sync, only
   on subsequent changes. As it is the initial sync that causes the
   problem that this patch is addressing, I had to look at a lower level.

 * The lsync lua C lib has an exec function, but it is hidden from
   config scripts except through the spawn(...) function. However spawn
   requires an event so can't be used for the initial sync.

 * I ended up going outside the lsync framework and using lua's own
   os.execute() function for pre/post cmds.

While this looks like a big patch, its actually a relatively small
change to the default rsync script. See
https://github.com/hughsaunders/lsyncd/compare/master...hughsaunders:rsync_prepost
for a comparison.

There are a couple of places in the code where we were not catching
NotFound exceptions which resulted in getting the exception logged
incorrectly in the logs and the error message being returned by the WSGI
layer being slightly off.

Cases where this was happening are volume encryption metadata and volume
transfer.

From the user perspective the error was very similar to what it was
expected, but it was preceeded by the name of the Cinder exception (ex:
VolumeNotFound: ).

This patch catches all NotFound exception at the WSGI level and properly
converts them, that way we prevent the exception to propagate to the
middleware fault level and generate a log exception and return slightly
different error.

The probe test in question tries to make a manifest referencing
unavailable objects and expects that to fail with a 400. If the SLO
middleware is enabled, then it checks the segments, can't find some,
and returns the 400. If it's disabled, the PUT succeeds and makes an
object whose contents are some JSON blob. In the latter case, the
probe test would fail because it expected a real SLO manifest but
didn't find one.

Now we skip the remainder of the test when we detect that SLO is not
enabled.

Background for this work can be read on the mailing list:

http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-May/094063.html

Usage of the new Neutron is by setting the following in
ENABLED_SERVICES:

* neutron-api
* neutron-l3
* neutron-agent
* neutron-dhcp
* neutron-metadata-agent

For now, the new neutron library supports just the ML2 plugin, with the
Open vSwitch and Linux Bridge agents supported. All other Neutron
plugins should be creating their own DevStack plugin if they wish for
DevStack to support them. Many of them already do.

Other notable changes compared to neutron-legacy:

* Rely on the Neutron defaults, and force Neutron to make
  sane defaults instead of all kinds of knobs in DevStack.

* Default to rootwrap daemon support

* Use the security group driver by default

* interface_driver can now use NEUTRON_AGENT (linuxbridge, openvswitch), since
  they are entrypoints in neutron's setup.cfg

* Use NEUTRON_AGENT variable to determine which agent to run
  Works with NEUTRON_AGENT set to either ""linuxbridge"" or ""openvswitch""
  Default is openvswitch for the time being.

* Set ML2 configuration for VXLAN support

* Remove Xen hypervisor stuff - it should be a plugin

* Move L3 crud into separate service file:

  There's a lot of L3 configuration that was in the main neutron file, but
  a lot of it is self contained and can be moved into its own file.

  The new l3 service file will contain all the previous L3 plumbing and
  configuration that the OpenStack Gate expects, while also eventually
  moving the whole l3 network creation step into a single hook that can be
  overridden by plugins.

* Introduce a check for a function ""neutron_plugin_create_initial_networks"" which
  will become the mechanism through which different topologies, and
  networking plugins can create and wire the initial networks that are
  created during a stack.sh run.

The new lib/neutron is considered experimental, and followup patches
will build upon this one. Existing users of lib/neutron-legacy should
remain unharmed.

If a driver implements optimized migration, share status is stuck
'migrating' and task state is stuck 'migration_in_progress' if
2-phase migration is not used. This change addresses it by properly
setting the task state and status for this specific scenario.
This change also adds 'host' to model update performed by manager,
to prevent confusion related to drivers having to return such
value in their model update or not.

The worker used by Nova to log instance serial console output can
log an exception message.

The issue is that logging a message from a different thread causes
Nova to hang. It seems that the logging file handler causes issues
when greenthreads and multiple native threads are used at the same,
and the native threads log messages.

This patch removes this log message for now. In the future, we
should fix the logging handler to avoid this issue.

NOTE: This issue has already been solved in Mitaka in os-win,
which the Hyper-V driver uses since Mitaka.

The fix is to convert the bytes to a proper string.

Note: Python27 evaluates isinstance(str, bytes) to True even for a string.  For
this reason we first exclude strings in the condition and then evaluate if it
is bytes.

implements post-as-copy or COPY then we need to plumb

It is a little odd perhaps to have these tests under

the test setup and base test code that already exists
in test_sysmeta.py into test_copy.py.

Start the initial work to ensure that callers creating a RequestContext
object will do so with keyword arguments. The benefit of this is that
there is no confusion about what arguments are being used.

Previously callers could make a call like:
  ctx = RequestContext(None, 'user', None, 'example.com')

This change is the first step in requiring the callers to specify each
argument using a keyword.

Added unit tests for change.

TODO: Figure out how to do logging to warn developers to fix their code
to use keyword arguments if they are using plain args.

HPE added some additional tracking of the instanced ID metadata on the
3PAR storage arrays back in Icehouse. When a volume was attached, the
instance ID was stored on the 3PAR and removed on detach.
Initially this this was over SSH and moved to REST calls due to
performance issues. Many customers still have issues with this unused
feature on upgrades and under heavy load.

The tracking of the instance ID is no longer required by HPE and has no
affect on any of the Cinder functionality. This unused feature will also
be a problem when multi-attach lands, so it's being removed by this
patch.

At present, there are various interfaces through which services data
can  be manipulated - admin interface(nova-manage), extensions
(contrib/services.py), etc. Every interface relies on the servicegroup
layer API is_up() to get details about service live-ness. The proposal
is keep service data in nova database nova.services table and fetch
the live-ness information from the configured servicegroup(SG) driver.
Liveness will be a combination of service live-ness and RPC live-ness,
where the later will be computed based on information in nova.services.

The metadata-display should match properties using case insensitive.
I've found that if you pass in extra metadata properties to
Glance v1 at create time, it takes all the properties and stores
them as lower case. So when you create an image with metadata of
FOO=BAR, it will store as foo=bar.

There are some properties ""CIM_PASD_InstructionSet"" that when
create at the same time as creating the image get changed to
cim_pasd_instructionset"". When this gets subsequently retrieved
from Glance and displayed in the metadata-display widget,
it doesn't recognize them and won't show them.

To test, you need: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/236042/

Create an Image using the CIM Instruction Set metadata.

Go to image row and expand. You won't see the metadata.

Apply this patch git review -x 315295

Then do the same steps.  You'll see the metadata displayed:

This removes dependencies where backend code references code in the

interface, but the backends should not know anything about the core
(separation of concerns). And part of the risk here is a potential for
circular dependencies.

Currently there is a race between the repo servers syncing and the first
role that attempts to install a pip package. This change ensures that
only the primary repo server is accessible until the slaves are synced.

This is achieved by adding a hook into lsyncd that allows a command to
be run before and after each sync. This command is an ssh command to
connect to the relevant secondary container and stop/start nginx. As the
nginx user is unprivileged, a sudoers file is added to allow nginx to be
stopped and started.

Notes on adding the hook into lsyncd:
 * There is an existing script in lsyncd/examples for postcmd. This
   works at a higher level by adding an event onto the stack for
   executing a command once the sync has finished. I experimented with
   that but events dont get fired for the initial recursive sync, only
   on subsequent changes. As it is the initial sync that causes the
   problem that this patch is addressing, I had to look at a lower level.

 * The lsync lua C lib has an exec function, but it is hidden from
   config scripts except through the spawn(...) function. However spawn
   requires an event so can't be used for the initial sync.

 * I ended up going outside the lsync framework and using lua's own
   os.execute() function for pre/post cmds.

While this looks like a big patch, its actually a relatively small
change to the default rsync script. See
https://github.com/hughsaunders/lsyncd/compare/master...hughsaunders:rsync_prepost
for a comparison.

At the feedback session at the Newton summit, we had feedback that
publishing release announcements under the ""[release]"" topic tag
cluttered up the mail being filtered by folks who need to listen for
information from the release team. Similarly, adding [stable] as a tag
to email related to stable branches makes far more email show up for
folks who need to watch for instructions from the stable team.

This patch changes ""release"" to ""new"" and removes the stable tag from
the subject line entirely. The body of the message still says when the
release is part of a stable series.

lib/img-functions:finalise_base() does a recursive unmount of /tmp to
cleanup any old mounts that might be in there (we do things like bind
mount caches in there).  unmount_dir fails if /tmp isn't a
directory.

The 'run_output_format_test.sh' uses the 'fake-os' element for
testing.  Because 'fake-os' did not create the '/tmp' directory, the
test script fails.

This patch fixes the problem: it adds '/tmp' to the list of
directories that are created.

It was implemented replacing the existing five 'mkdir'
command with a for loop over now six directories.

Without specifying messaging_urls, ceilometer only listens on the vhost
specified in the rabbit configuration directives.
To align with the the default OSA architecture, which isolates each service
into it's own respective rabbitmq vhost, this patchset has added jinja code
in the ceilometer.conf.j2 template to specifiy a messaging_url for each service,
 and for each service, each rabbitmq host. This ensures ceilometer is spawning
the correct number of listeners on the correct vhost and consuming notifications
correctly.

In addition, a few small changes were made in the patch set:

* store_events is now True by default
* rabbitmq_userid and rabbitmq_vhost service variables have been moved to group_vars.

In order to test that error messages are now persisted,
a method of guaranteeing that a Trove create command
will fail is needed.  The simplest way to do that is to
attempt to allocate more resources from Nova than it
has available.  To this effect, a 'fault' flavor has
been added.

Also bumped up the disk on mariadb to handle more
operating systems.

Since mitaka, agents can send a new report about the resource versions
they know about, and subscribe via rpc callback push mechanisms.
Some agents don't depend on versioned objects via push, and therefore
don't need to update neutron-server about such details, anyway server
side was complaining when that dictionary was missing on the state
report.

This patch avoids the warning log for missing 'resource_versions'
field in the agent status report.

should increase by adding one more ROUTER socket to proxy.

When swift disks fill up completely it becomes difficult to perform
operations since delete operations require a write.

By setting this value we can ensure that PUT requests won't happen when
the disk space is below the threshold set (in bytes). This will not
govern rsyncs, which can still happen to fill up the disks, but assuming
a reasonably uniform distribution of data this should help prevent disks
from filling up.

Sometimes the main thread starts before the spawned thread, which means
that the thread that is supposed to hold open a connection starts after
the main thread has already successfully made a connection. This means
that the test for a successful connection attempt[1] was nearly useless
since the main thread would get the connection first and activate it[2]
no matter how long the spawned thread waited, and the test for a failed
connection attempt[3] would intermittently fail since is sometimes able
to get the connection before the busy-waiting worker thread does.
Adding a short sleep in the main thread ensures that the main thread
yields to the worker thread and it can grab the connection first so we
can actually test what happens in the main thread.

As reported at bug/1546067, expirer might accidentally deletes an object
which is created after x-delete-at timestamp. This is because expirer
sends a request with ""X-Timestamp: <current_timestamp>"" and tombstone
is named as <requested_x_timestamp>.ts so if object creation time is
between x-delete-at and expirer's DELETE request x-timestamp, the object
might be hidden by tombstone.

This possibility can be simply removed if the value of x-timestamp which
an expirer sends is the same timestamp as x-delete-at of an actual object.
Namely, expirer pretends to delete an object at the time an user really
wants to delete it.

The unit tests
    test_deallocate_for_instance_2_with_requested
    test_deallocate_for_instance_2
in
    nova.tests.unit.network.test_neutronv2.TestNeutronv2
fail randomly. An example error looks like this:

    b'mox3.mox.UnexpectedMethodCallError: Unexpected method call.
    unexpected:- expected:+'
    b""- Client.delete_port('my_portid1') -> None""
    b'? ^'
    b""+ Client.delete_port('my_portid2') -> None""
    b'?

This is due to the mox record with expected the deletion of multiple
ports on an instance in a specific order. This order is not important
though and also not the same in each test case execution. To make it
explicit in the test case, that the order is *not* important, I've
chosen to define that in the mock records with ""InAnyOrder()"".

Another solution could have been to ensure the order of the port IDs
through the unit tests, but that could be interpreted as a precondition
for the functional code to work correctly, which is a wrong assumption
and therefore not chosen for this fix.

The git_diff method is currently only used for listing requirements
changes, and that's actually hard-coded into the method itself
with the header it uses before running the git diff command.

This makes the method more generic and adds a specific method
for dumping requirements changes.

The hope is to build on this by adding code that parses the
requirements diff output looking for new dependencies added
in stable branch release requests so we can fail those types
of backports.

Building just en_US (along with POSIX/C) brings things inline with
debootstrap.  As discussed in the bug referenced, this is about the
best we can do for Centos7.

Fedora 24 has split languages out into packages so we don't have to do
this, but I have not dealt with that yet.  A guard is put in place so
we make sure we revisit this when we try to build F24.

When the proxy is handling an object GET response and an object server
fails to send data in a timely fashion, the proxy can pick up where it
left off with another object server; other than a pause in the
download, the client doesn't even know anything happened.

However, if the proxy received the GET response headers but no data,
it would resume at the wrong spot. In particular, for an N-byte
object, it would ask the second object server for the last N-1 bytes
(or equivalently, all but the first byte). For a replicated storage
policy, this would result in the client getting an abbreviated
download, while for an EC storage policy, the proxy would 500 after
trying to decode a fragment set with a bogus fragment in it.

This commit fixes the resumption logic to ask for all N bytes of the
object from the second object server.

If you have a master and a slave configured and you insert
new data into the master, it will cause subsequent replica
create to fail.

The problem is that we weren't setting the gtid_purged variable
using the metadata in the xtrabackup_binlog_info file. The
Mysql GTID replication strategy was adjusted to account for this.

A release note has been added.

The replication scenario tests were enhanced to validate this
issue.

Note: this issue doesn't occur with MariaDB GTID replication
because it mechanism is different.

Scenario tests were run succesfully on Mysql, Percona and
MariaDB with this change in place.

Due to a mis-match in the code however, the wrong call is being

through the provider or multiprovider net extensions, this could be
useful to unblock other work around segments.

Service commands may take some time to return.
The current code does not pass any timeout value into the execute
function resulting in the default 30s value being used.
That value turns out to be too short for certain datastores
(Cassandra) on slower/heavily-loaded systems.

Trove already has a timeout (default=3min) for instance state changes that
should be used instead (this timeout has already been used when
polling for database states).

The service command execute function have been updated to accept an
optional timeout kwargs (like the shell command execute function).
The state change timeout is now being passed in from DB
start/stop/restart calls.

Following fd86d5a, the object-auditor would leave status files so it
could resume where it left off if restarted. However, this would also
cause the object-reconstructor to print warnings like:

  Unexpected entity in data dir: u'/srv/node4/sdb8/objects/auditor_status_ZBF.json'

...which isn't actually terribly useful or actionable. The auditor will
clean it up (eventually); the operator doesn't have to do anything.

Now, the reconstructor will specifically ignore those status files.

The scenario tests need to have the group classes broken
up to allow interleaving of the different parts of the tests
so that the gate can finish in a reasonable amount of time.

The runners, however, need to be the same for each main group,
thus allowing state to be preserved between groups of the same
feature.  The creation of runners was refactored to allow for this.

The module tests were also modified to use the new paradym, which
allowed the removal of the global varaibles in the runner.

Dependencies on tests.api were also removed.

When performing instance evacuation (which is essentially ""rebuild an
instance elsewhere""), image metadata is not persistent -- this manifests
only when instances are on shared storage.

So, supply the original instance metadata to 'image_meta' parameter,
instead of an empty dict.

Liberty notes (compared to upstream Newton/Mitaka):

  - We get the image metadata from the instance object's
    system_metadata.
  - We're modifying the tests
    'test_rebuild_on_host_with_shared_storage()' and
    'test_on_shared_storage_not_provided_host_with_shared_storage()' to
    exercise the code change.

This patch moves the assignment abstract base class out of core and into
backends/base.py

This removes dependencies where backend code references code in the
core. The reasoning being that the core should know about the backend
interface, but the backends should not know anything about the core
(separation of concerns). And part of the risk here is a potential for
circular dependencies.

DeploySelectedNodesWithTasks is intended to run only specified set of
tasks on specified nodes. In Fuel 9.0 LCM serializers have been
introduced, hence tasks are skipped if their condition return 'False'
(and it does, since no changes may introduced).

This introduces inconvenience for operators, who want to run particular
task on nodes and do not care if there were changes or not. That's why
this commit introduces the '?force' HTTP parameter for the mentioned
handler. If 'force' is true, the task will be executed unconditionally.

In testing the fix for this, it became apparent that the code for
configuring guest images was never workable; the TOKEN variable was
never really initialized.

Both issues have been addressed.

If one uses only a single replica and a database file is placed on a
wrong partition, it will be removed instead of replicated to the correct
partition.

There are two reasons for this:
1. The list of nodes is empty when there is only a single replica
2. all(responses) is True even if there is no response at all, and the
latter is always True if there is no node to replicate to.

This patch fixes this by adding a special case if used with only one
replica to the node selection loop and ensures that the list of
responses is not empty.  Also adds a test that fails on current master
and passes with this change.

patch modifies the `get_inventory` function to make the cleanup action
optional. This was done to facilitate the tests, since they required
that clean up not happen in order to verify the relevant scenarios.

This patch does not change functionality of the argument parsing
function, but does make it easier to test. While argparse has its own
tests within the standard library and the `args` function could
theoretically be excluded, including these simple tests provide the
coverage we need without introducing the possibility of skipping over
code that might be added later.
