Part of multi-patch set for easier chunks.

There have been quite a few instances found where the
i18n guidelines are not being followed. I believe this
has helped lead to some of the confusion around how to
correctly do this. Other developers see this code and
assume it is an example of the correct usage.

This patch attempts to clean up most of those violations
in the existing codebase to hopefully help avoid some of
that confusion in reviews.

Some issues address:
* Correct log translation markers for different log levels
* Passing format values as arguments to call, not preformatting
* Not forcing translation via six.text_type and others

Guidelines can be found here:
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.i18n/guidelines.html

Hacking checks will not be able to identify all violations of
the guidelines, but it could be useful for catching obvious ones
such as LOG.info(""No markers!"").

Temporary workaround for bug #1433812. CoreOS processes the
cloud-config.yml too late the boot process to prevent mounting and
processing the configdrive. Pass coreos.configdrive=0 on the kernel
command line to ensure this doesn't occur, as it can be a security risk
(previous tenants may have written a malicious configdrive, and it would
be read before being cleaned).

Long-term, we should remove this workaround and either completely remove
the mount units from the ramdisk during the build process or get a
better fix from upstream (https://github.com/coreos/bugs/issues/314).

The test_list_availability_zones_enabled_service test calls
a method which returns a tuple that is generated from a dict.
This is compared to a tuple in the test, which can fail when
PYTHONHASHSEED is not 0, due to the tuples containing elements
in different orders.  (Because the dict used to build the tuple
was ordered differently.)

Without this patch, openstackclient has no way to specify to which
project a network belongs upon creation. Instead, it uses the project
ID that the user is authenticating with to fill the tenant_id column.
This is a problem because an admin user is unable to specify a project
for a non-admin network. To fix this and to improve feature parity with
the neutron client, this patch adds project and domain parameters to
the network create command and uses the given project name to look up
the project ID.

Neutron does not allow the project to be changed after creation, so no
such parameter has been added to the neutron set command.

Neutron calls the field 'tenant_id', but this change exposes the
parameter as '--project' to support the newer terminology.

If no project is specified, the client defaults to the previous
behavior of using the auth project.

The major change here is that httpretty is removed from test_resource in
favor of using a Mock session based off of the Session class.

Common replacements were:
* stub_url usage was replaced with a Mock return_value on the verb that
  was being stubbed.
* Places where we were accessing httpretty.last_request use some form of
  call_args on session verbs. Additionally, for the common case of
  checking whether an expected URL was generated to be called,
  assertCalledURL was created on the ResourceTests class.
* Some minor rearrangements to move several test methods out of TestFind
  and back into ResourceTests where they belong.

When using the websso feature in keystone, the identity provider is
looked up based on the value of the 'remote_id_attribute' environment

searched for against the 'remote_id' field in the backend where identity

field.

When revert-resize call is finished, it doesn't clear instance

The driver call, which is responsible for destroying destination
host instance is not deleting instance files, because it finds that
both source and destination host shares the same instance storage.

The check_instance_shared_storage rpc-call had no host information,
hence the manager call for check_instance_shared_storage was checking
instance storage on destination host itself and returning True even
if it is non-shared storage.

Added host parameter to check_instance_shared_storage rpc-call,
so that in manager call check_instance_shared_storage method get
executed on source compute node and returns True/False based on

Depending upon how the chef-client is envoked, it does a
STDOUT.tty? check to determine if output should be sent to
the doc formatter as STDOUT.  In many cases this check returns
false.  To override this, I added the --force-formatter option
to the chef-client so we can always get the output to STDOUT.
This will help with allowing batch testing to capture

A data volume container is far superior to bind mounting the
host's shared directories.  It preserves the idempotency,
immutability and declarative properties of the containers.

The way this works in practice is that a data volume container is
created.  Then when the containers start they use LVM to access
the filesystem where /var/lib/docker is contained.  Then the
container startup logic bindmounts the data volume stored on the
host filesystem in /var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/ID.  This prevents
people with access to the host operating system from damaging
the contents of the data container.

It does mean that now we must use tools/stop to stop our containers
rather than tools/cleanup-containers -f.

This is a containers best practice.  For more details see:

https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/

Big credit goes to Danyeon Hansen for seeding this idea in the
mariadb containers.

Note occasionally docker-compose start/stop seems to not want to stop
a container.  This bug needs to be addressed upstream separately
from our utilization of this best practice.

The media.py file is used to attach the config drive to the VM via a
virtual optical media.  Initially, the code required a single static
Virtual I/O Server that it could connect to.

However, PowerVM systems support multiple Virtual I/O Servers.  In case
one is offline, the code should simply move over to the other Virtual
I/O Server (if there is one or more available).

This change supports this scenario.  Changes because of this:
 - Removed the need for the vio_map to be passed into the media.py
 - Used static variables to significantly reduce the overhead of
   validation.
 - Consolidated the CreateCfgDrive and ConnectCfgDrive tasks into a
   single method.  This was required to maintain VIO precision upon the
   scsi mapping.

throw a reference which would get reported.
This is problematic as the user doesn't expect that.

Further more, we can't can't catch ReferenceError and ignore since the
underlying callback might throw that and there is no way to
differentiate with a proxy object.

By using a weakref.ref() object we have a concrete stage were we get the
strong reference and can clear the entry in case the callback was freed.

We use uWSGI mules for this task. This is because on scale lab we have timeout
errors which are reported like this:

DEBUG - Uuuups https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1384623 again

Thus the idea to offload most of the work done in this handler to an
asynchronous worker (uWSGI mule in this case). Note that increasing uWSGI
workers count doesn't help -- timeouts for this specific request will still
occur, we would only have the advantage of not blocking the API so much.

Other suggestions were made:
- use receiverd -- this has the disadvantage of breaking current flow of
  messages which is something like Nailgun -> Astute -> receiver
  (we would have in this case: Nailgun -> receiver -> Astute -> receiver
  which is not intuitive)
- use Celery -- this is a big change and not a bad idea for the future
  but we would like to have this merged for the 6.1 release, mules are at
  hand already
- performance improvements -- this is not that easy too (as noted in the
  blueprint 200-nodes-support)

Refactors diskfile.py to implement policy-type-specific
diskfile behavior in diskfile (sub-)classes.

This patch creates policy type specific diskfile
classes to allow some inheritance and overriding
of get_ondisk_files and hash_cleanup_listdir.

Also moves the file name mangling methods
from storage_policy.py to diskfile.py (ts_to_fname
and fname_to_ts). IMHO that is the right place for them
since they are diskfile-implementation choices and the new
classes added provide a better home for them.

The `execute_tasks` method was designed to execute some abstract tasks
sent by Nailgun. Hence, in the end of execution if all is ok it sends
the ""ready"" status back to Nailgun. It's wrong in case of pre_provision
tasks, because they don't mean provisioning is done.

Since this commit we're running pre_provision tasks by means Nailgun
Hooks and therefore do not report ""ready"" when they are done.

The high points:
- Moved trigger_id from assembly to plan in datamodels
- Added an internal method to find assemblies by plan
- Moved trigger_uri generation to plan
- Moved trust_id from assembly to plan in datamodels
- Renamed tools/trigger-assembly.py to trigger-app.py
- Deploy, if successful, should destroy (soon, just shutdown)
  other assemblies

The low points:
- ED WHERE ARE YOUR TESTS MAN NOTHING WORKS
- SERIOUSLY YOU DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH THE TESTS
- shell_nobuild doesn't use deployer, so deployer doesn't
  remove old assemblies
- A lot of code was shamelessly teleported to plan_handler
  from assembly_handler, mostly to reduce the complexity of
  these changes. See how well that worked!
- Yes, plan_handler makes use of an assembly_handler. I'm not
  sure if that's the best way to do it, but it's worked well
  enough for most of my attempts!

This feature provides the query.update_on_match()
and query.update_returning_pk() methods, as well
as the manufacture_persistent_object(),
manufacture_entity_criteria(), and manufacture_criteria()
utility functions.

query.update_on_match() is used to UPDATE a row based on a variety
of criteria, and to then return a fully persistent object
state representing the row that was matched.  It
essentially intends to provide an UPDATE that is guaranteed
to have matched a specific row in the presence of potential
race conditions without using any locking, and to then
return a record of that row as if it had been SELECTed.

query.update_returning_pk() is a public method that
also serves as part of the implementation of
query.update_on_match(); this method delivers an UPDATE
statement such that the primary key of the single row
matched is returned; if zero or multiple rows are matched,
and error is raised.   To handle this, several backend-specific
strategies are provided, which are automatically selected
based on the best available.  The lowest strategy
performs a re-SELECT, but still assumes there's
a simple unique column to be queried on, as is currently the
use case in Nova (uuid is present).  On Postgresql, MySQL
and other databases besides SQLite and possibly DB2, more
atomic strategies are used.

Currently the in-process tests build a 2 replica, 4 partition,
2 device object ring. This patch allows an alternative policy
and ring to be specified for testing via environment variables
that may optionally be set.

SWIFT_TEST_IN_PROCESS_CONF_DIR - This points the test setup to a
  directory which may have a swift.conf file and ring file. The
  test setup will then prefer these conf files over the samples
  in '/etc'.

SWIFT_TEST_POLICY - This causes the in-process test to
  use the specified policy from the swift.conf file and its
  associated ring for testing (first copying the conf and ring file
  and modifying device parameters to suit in-process testing). If
  not set, the tests will use the default policy.

The in-process tests now start sufficient object servers for the
ring file being tested against.

This should allow in-process functional testing of various policies
and rings (e.g. EC policies) without needing to reconfigure an SAIO
for each test scenario.

The refactoring of the in_process test setup code should also
allow easier addition of other 'hard-coded' test policies/rings
in the future.

With the introduction of microversions, node fields that are added in
a particular (micro)version should not be made visible to requests
for older versions. This patch puts the logic for handling this for
all such new fields in one method: hide_fields_in_newer_versions().

This should make it easier for developers to know where to add code,
and will (hopefully) prevent multiple methods from popping up for
each new set of fields.

This also removes the exception handling in allow_logical_names()
because it is not needed, since it is no longer being called in a
method where a pecan.request might not be available (eg, when
generating a sample of a Node for the documentation).

Wikipedia's list of common misspellings [1] has a machine-readable
version.  This patch fixes those misspellings mentioned in the list
which don't have multiple right variants (as e.g. ""accension"", which can
be both ""accession"" and ""ascension""), such misspellings are left
untouched.  The list of changes was manually re-checked for false
positives.

This image should be a suitable alternative to
Fedora-x86_64-20-20140618-sda, with the extra benefit that it is
prepared to install the heat config agent projects during boot
so that test_server_software_config can be enabled.

This will also allow devstack to no longer load
Fedora-x86_64-20-20140618-sda onto the nodepool images which will reduce

Add first test for patching environment, which
deploys some cluster and apply patches on it.
Environment configuration (deployment test) is chosen
automatically based on packages tags.
Tests require errata.yaml which should include scenarios
for applying/verifying patches.
Additional variables required by patching tests:
 * PATCHING_MIRRORS - list of repositories with patched
   packages;
 * PATCHING_WEB_DIR - directory on master node which is
   available via HTTP (used for new repository);
 * PATCHING_BUG_ID - bug ID which is going to be fixed;
 * PATCHING_PKGS_TESTS - local path or URL to destination
   where test plans for packages are stored;
 * PATCHING_APPLY_TESTS - local path or URL which should
   be used to get test plans for bugs (using bug ID);
 * PATCHING_PKGS - list of patched packages; if empty -
   list is gotten from test plan (errata.yaml) or from
   repository.

When configured to use sentinel with the redis driver, allow the
redis-py client to manage the connection to the currently elected
master.

'master_for' will return a StricRedis client which is bound to a
connection pool that queries the Sentinel[s] when providing
connections from the pool.

This means that failover handling is automatic as long as the
sentinels can be reached and they have elected a new master.

This change adds a prepare_test_env.sh script which builds a
heat_integrationtests.conf using the iniset function from devstack.

prepare_test_env.sh can be run locally with appropriate credentials
and a valid $DEST. In the gate post_test_hook.sh runs prepare_test_env.sh
with sudo so it has the required permissions to write
heat_integrationtests.conf.

Instead of adding more environment variables which are used as default
config options, replace those by actually writing out a
heat_integrationtests.conf file with the required values. This was always
the original intention - it just hadn't been done yet.

The exception to this is the sourced auth environment variables which
are very convenient to not have to state explicitly in the config file.

Method network_in_use_on_host checks whether a number of
fixed IPs in network is greater than 0. For that this method
takes a list of fixed IPs for network and checks the length
of this list. Actually we don't need to get a list of
fixed IPs with useless information. We can just get count of
these IPs using query.count() method.

It will improve performance because we won't collect
useless information about fixed IPs by db query.

it's already covered by tests from test_db_api.

All the cross subnet traffic (between VMs of the same tenant)
in DVR is now handled locally on the compute node using the router namespace.
A Linux namespace is created for every virtual router,

The local DVR performs the routing and replaces the source MAC address and
the destination MAC address for every packet leaving the compute node.
In order to do that correctly, the router must be populated with

The V2 implentation of replication, including:
  - Ubuntu 14.04
  - Mysql 5.6
  - GTID Replication Strategy
  - promote-to-replica-source
  - eject-replica-source
  - --replica_count option to create
  - replica creation from incremental backups

By agreement with Slicknik (Trove PTL), the following
exclusions from the spec have been made:
  - slave promoted to master by eject not replaced
  - slave promoted by eject chosen by txn count

Alias decorator allows you to name a command exposed to cli
to point to a method of a different name.
example:
    @cliutils.alias(""import"")
    def import_verification...

will result in command:
rally verify import

This is useful for commands using reserved words or
to avoid commands following python function naming
conventions:
'rally task sla_check'
could be
'rally task sla-check'
by using  alias decorator.

- update sample/test conf files to use the new convention

This has become more important, as the recent changes to devstack
now use the new [database] section, and the gate is failing due to

oslo_db properly, and it might be better to do that out-of-band

This bug is caused because of the regression caused by
I1b719bed406b83c5f2deac06e127798a91f51ad7 . The original bug was
raised because check_max_uri was not working after the introduction
of sessionclient.  The change created a regression in which the
python bindings of the neutron client was not usable and causing
traces.

The fix is to revert the change id and add a new check_max_uri to
the sessionclient.  Now uri length will be checked in sessionclient
and  httpclient as well.  please see bug for further info.

Currently, migrate volume between two back-ends using LIO scsi
target fails due to the error of ""Unable to terminate volume
connection: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split'"".

The root cause of this error is _detach_volume() during volume
migration does not use updated volume object which is updated
during _attach_volume() by create_export().
As a result terminate_connection() which is called from
_detach_volume() tries to split volume['provider_location']
even if the entry is None and causes above error.

Also same error would be happened following methods.

- copy_volume_data(-> volume migration)
- backup_volume
- restore_backup
- copy_image_to_volume
- copy_volume_to_image

This change adds updated volume as an additional return value
for _attach_volume().

SAN driver was sending commands over ssh with whitespaces between
every character resulting in commands like ""u n a m e - s"" instead
of ""uname -s"" (example from bug report).

As the bug reporter noted, the problem was that there were two joins
in the process of mounting the command. The first one got the
tuple and joined into a string. The second one joined a whitespace
between each character of the string.

Additionally, this behavior made utils.ssh_injection a bad check,
because it expected a list of args used in 'for arg in cmd_list' and
what it got was a single string. This resulted in the check being made
over the single characters instead of each arg.

All this is to explain why I chose to remove the first join instead of
the second one.

An unit test for this issue was created. SAN driver had no unit test.

Puppet's `commands` and `has_command` methods are not able to separate
stdout and stderr. When the openstack command prints out unexpected
warnings that have no bearing on our computation, we need to ignore it,
otherwise the CSV module will fail to parse it. This patch filters the
total response produced by the openstack command into only lines that
match a CSV-like regular expression with at least two fields.

If a legitimate error is produced that causes the command to return
failure, puppet catches it during the command execution and raises a
Puppet::Execution error, so this change will not affect its ability to
detect legitimate failures and report on them.
