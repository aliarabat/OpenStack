Gateway ping is actually function of connectivity checker, not netconfig
one, so it should be moved from there. Also it breaks the case when
netconfig tasks ran on bootstrap node for network verification graph
when there is no default gateway yet.

With the recent changes to devstack and the migration
of the trove utility 'redstack' to 'trovestack' a number
of unnecessary items were brought over.  This change
attempts to fix some problems and clean up some issues:

 - Environment variables are ignored.
 - Credentials are taken from the clouds.yaml file or
   sourced from the devstack/accrc/{project}/{user} directory.
   This means that authentication is now done through the
   mechanism specified by devstack.
   This should fix the kick-start and clean issues.
 - The openstack client is used wherever possible with the
   same set of credentials as mentioned above.
 - References to stable/<branch> have been removed.
 - The trove devstack plugin is assumed to be in the trove repo.
 - Sourcing /tmp/integration/env.rc has been removed (items in
   this file can be moved to ~/.trovestack.options.rc if needed).
 - set_home_dir was removed.
 - The fault flavors no longer set up 'resize' versions of themselves.
 - Help for int-tests was improved to add scenario examples and
   a few other minor clarifications.

This should fix the issues people may have been having with
'kick-start' giving an authentication error after sourcing the
openrc file or 'clean' not running properly.  There should be
no more 'plugin already enabled' style errors either.

Note: The original code for switching to V3 of authentication was
removed as it wasn't an issue with kick-start/clean up per se.
It still should be fixed, but as a separate set of changes.

If a node is really slow then a single test can take longer than an
hour. It will then fail as the client it has cached will now have an
expired token. To alleviate this, the caching of the clients was removed
(since the time saved on caching the clients is probably negligible
anyway).

Checking the client code was also cleaned up for a number of tests.

The cluster tests were modified, however the code was reverted as
there is no way to test it at present (they will not run as they
haven't been modified to work with the new neutron set up).  This
will be fixed in a separate changereq (since they are currently not
being tested in the gate, this should not hold up development).

In the process of refactoring most of the token provider API, I
proposed a patch that would raise an exception if a v2.0 token was
validated to prove nothing in keystone was currently validating v2.0
tokens. This commit removes the exception from the v2.0 validation
path because we will need to be able to validate v2.0 token during
and upgrade from Newton to Ocata.

The shim should remain in the token provider through-out the Ocata
release, but it can be removed as soon as Pike opens for development.
When deployments upgrade from Ocata to Pike, hopefully deployments
will no longer have any v2.0 tokens and they will all be considered
expired anyway.

We've got user reported bugs that when opperating with slow NFS
backends with large (30+ GB) disk files, the prlimit of cpu_time 2 is
guessed to be the issue at hand because if folks hot patch a qemu-img
that runs before the prlimitted one, the prlimitted one succeeds.

This increases the allowed cpu timeout, as well as tweaking the error
message so that we return something more prescriptive when the
qemu-img command fails with prlimit abort.

The original bug (#1449062) the main mitigation concern here was a
carefully crafted image that gets qemu-img to generate > 1G of json,
and hence could be a node attack vector. cpu_time was never mentioned,
and I think was added originally as a belt and suspenders addition. As
such, bumping it to 8 seconds shouldn't impact our protection in any
real way.

When dealing with vhostuser ports, plugins need to know the
name of such ports in order to perform plug/unplug.
The current implementation of vhostuser ovs plug computes
this vif name directly in the plugin while this information
could be directly stored in the object class.

This patch adds this port name (vif_name) to the VIFVHostUser
class to prepare future rework of this vhostuser ovs plug and to
enable different vhostuser plug mechanisms (including fast path)
that needs this vif_name as well.

An output of shell commands is processed in some methods

it's possible that the output contains unexpected characters

Setting LANG=C and LC_ALL=C assures that unexpected characters

alternative would be setting them in the 'execute'

We have a global regex that made all 'gate-rally-dsvm-rally-.*' jobs
non-voting. This now made the job gate-rally-dsvm-rally-ubuntu-xenial
non-voting as well, something that does not seem to have been the
intention of change I373327609709ad7322e8f0aea9b7f7395e45bd19,
since the job was voting before and in both check and gate queue.

Instead of a non-voting regex, add {suffix} to the
gate-rally-dsvm-rally-{service} jobs and use -nv for them. This has the
side effect of making gate-rally-dsvm-rally-ubuntu-xenial voting again.

Change jobs gate-rally-dsvm-verify in similar way - add suffix and use
-nv as appropriate.

Currently the Keystone leader charm creates new domains and stores
the UUIDs locally on disk. This approach predates charm relation-/
leader- storage, is error prone, and causes problems in HA setups.

Move to leader storage and remove old interfaces. There is no need
to migrate the on-disk stored data as it is read from the deployment
and stored as a part of the upgrade process.

Do not set default values for service_tenant_id, admin_domain_id and
default_domain_id. This will cause context to be incomplete on peer
units until the values are actually available.

Change functional tests to run on Keystone cluster to verify contents of
configuration and operation of services in clustered environment.

1. What is the problem?
Function assertNotEqual(None. ...) is still used in file driver.py.
OpenStack Style Guidelines suggest to use assertIs(Not)None to check for
None Unit test assertions, as assertIs(Not)None tends to give better
messages for more specific assertions. More info, see:

[H203] Use assertIs(Not)None to check for None (off by default) Unit
test assertions tend to give better messages for more specific
assertions. As a result, assertIsNone(...) is preferred over
assertEqual(None, ...) and assertIs(None, ...), and assertIsNotNone(...)
is preferred over assertNotEqual(None, ...) and assertIsNot(None,
...). Off by default.
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/hacking/#unit-tests-and-assertraises

2. What is the solution to the problem?
Rplace 'assertNotEqual(None, ...)' with 'assertIsNotNone(...)'

Trivial fix.

When we go to spawn a libvirt domain, we catch a few types of exceptions
and perform cleanup before failing the operation. For some reason, we
don't do this universally, which means that we leave things like network
devices laying around (from plug_vifs()). If a delete comes later, it
should clean those things up. However, if a subsequent failure prevents
that, and especially if we do a local delete at the API, we'll leak those
interfaces.

As seen in at least one real-world situation, this can cause us to leak
interfaces until we have tens of thousands of them on the system, which
then causes secondary failures.

Since we run the cleanup() routine for certain failures, it certainly
seems appropriate to run it always and not leave residue until a
successful delete is performed.

Due to a bug in core python library [1], if iterator passed
to imap or imap_unordered raises an exception, it hangs in
deadlock forever, the issue is fixed in python 2.7.10, but
upstream repositories have much older version.

This is based on previous work [1] and it's what I've been using to
test the TLS-everywhere work.

This introduces a template that will run on every node to enroll
them to FreeIPA and acquire a ticket (authenticate) in order to be
able to request certificates.

Enrollment is done via the ipa-client-install command and it does
the following:

* Get FreeIPA's CA certificate and trust it.
* Authenticate to FreeIPA using an OTP and get a kerberos keytab.
* Set up several configurations that are needed for FreeIPA (sssd,
  kerberos, certmonger)

The keytab is then used to authenticate and get an actual TGT
(Ticket-Granting-Ticket) from Kerberos

The previous implementation used a PreConfig hook, however, here it
was modified to use NodeTLSCAData. This has the advantage that it
runs on every node as opposed to the PreConfig hook where we had to
specify the role type so it's a usability improvement. And, on the
other hand, this does set up necessary things for the usage of
FreeIPA as a CA, such as getting the certificate and enrolling to the
CA.

Some jobs are not particularly relevant anymore: we periodically
test neutron-lib master changes against neutron [1] and we are
no longer actively working on vpnaas.

This patch frees up some slots.

Following change is meant to enable running python jobs
for Python3.5. Change was inspired by the recent
changes regarding cross-python compatybility and attempts
to make monasca compatible with Python 3.x.

New gates will be non-voting so they won't make new/existing
changes blocked but will allow to detect all incompatibilities
between Python 2.x and Python 3.x

Additionally, added full set of Python CI for monasca-events-api.
This project development is going to be restarted and by that
reason it should be fully compliant to Python CI.

The image cache operation uses thread locks, for which reason it is
prone to race conditions when using shared storage. This is avoided
by using file locks, placed on the shared path.

As per findings [1], the hook was found to be a burden. That is
because of the lazy join on every DB lookup required to fetch
the MAC for the subport. Instead of issuing a gazillion JOINs
(one per each subport), this patch modifies the loop and speed
it up at the expenses of some temporary memory cost: it does so
by building a temporary map, looking up ports by IDs (which is
bleeding fast) and reassembling the data from the temp map as
the API expects it to be. Pronto!

Developers usually use method CONF.set_override to change
config option's value in tests. By default the parameter
enforce_type=False, it doesn't check any type or value of
override. If set enforce_type=True , will check parameter
verride type and value. In production code, oslo_config
always checks config option's value. In short, we test and
run code in different ways. For more details when we set method
set_override with parameter enforce_type=True, please see:

The linuxbridge agent for Neutron expects that the public bridge will
already be created by the time it starts. On devstack, this only occurs
as part of the l3 agent configuration. If a compute node doesn't have an
l3 agent and is using a linuxbridge agent, then br-ex won't be created
and the process will not be able to start (causing stack.sh to fail).

This causes the gate-grenade-dsvm-neutron-linuxbridge-multinode-nv gate
to fail. To avoid the issue, skip the bridge mappings setup unless L3 is
configured. This is done in a backward compatible fashion: if localrc
uses the old q-l3 tags, the is_service_enabled neutron-l3 would not be
able to succeed.

When listing instances in the cellv2 world we look them up
from three locations:

1. Build requests which exist before the instances are created
   in the cell database (after the scheduler picks a host to
   build the instance). Currently instances and build requests
   are both created before casting to conductor, but that's going
   away in Ocata with the support for multiple cellsv2 cells.
2. The cell0 database for instances which failed to get scheduled
   to a compute host (and therefore a cell).
3. The actual cell database that the instance lives in. Currently
   that's only a single traditional nova database, but could be one
   of multiple cellsv2 cells when we add that support in Ocata.

If a marker is passed in when listing instances, if the instance
lives in an actual cell database, we'll get a MarkerNotFound failure
from cell0 because the instance doesn't exist in cell0, but we check
cell0 before we check the cell database. This makes the instance
listing short-circuit and fail with a 400 from the REST API.

This patch simply handles the MarkerNotFound when listing instances
from the cell0 database and ignores it so we can continue onto the
cell database.

Maintaining the context is important for keeping the request ID
and subsequently operator/developer sanity while debugging.
The resource_type is also helpful to have since a function could be
subscribed for multiple resources.

This maintains and deprecates the existing 'subscribe' method for
backwards compatibility with callbacks that don't support receiving
the context and resource type. A new 'register' method is added
for callbacks to use that are compatible with receiving the context.

Adds the plumbing to the Placement REST API for filtering resource
providers by a set of resources. We re-use the existing
resource_providers handler in the placement API and add the single
""resources"" query string parameter.

This patch moves the ""allowed_filters"" handling out of the
ResourceProviderList object and into the REST API handler, using a
JSONSchema object to provider the validation to match what is done for
the POST/PUT requests.

This makes us automatically set up a usable CellsV2 environment in
the base test case, if we're setting up database stuff. If the test
uses the DB normally, we get a cell0, a real cell, and create
hostmappings for any compute services that we start. If we're not
a DB-using test, we mock out the cell mapping stuff so that
everything appears to just be in the same cell.

This includes a fix for the nova-manage tests, which need to control
their own cells destiny now.

This includes a fix to the pci tests for libvirt, which were starting
the same compute service twice in a row. That no longer works because
we fail to create the duplicate hostmapping record, but we should not
have been doing that anyway. This makes us only create it once.

This includes a fix to the connection switching test to set up the
database fixtures itself since it requires a specific environment
that we now confuse by always going through the CellDatabases fixture.

haven't checked that the voting tests in this chagne actually work on

This patch adds a plugin that reads metrics from JSON files. This
makes it very easy to integrate with Monasca -- instead of writing
a new plugin, simply write your metrics to a file.

The advantage of this mechanism is that:
- It's simple and easy to understand
- It is asynchronous with Monasca Agent. There are two technical
  advantages to this:
    - Your check does not need to run at same frequency as
      the agent.
    - If your check blocks, this does not affect other checks
      in the agent because the agent is not blocked.
- You can create the metrics as a side effect of doing other
  stuff. For example, a server process can write the JSON
  file while it is processing requests. With the normal plugin
  architecture, you need to write code that talks to your
  server process to access the metrics.
- You can write the check code in any language.

Certain mocks were not set with autospec=True, meaning that calls to
methods or attributes of those mocks that don't exist would pass
silently. Additionally, an error string raised during incorrect test
behavior would have failed due to an incorrect use of Python's join()
method. Additional information is included in the error message now,

This function was added as part of [1] as a way to
prevent _find_ipv6_router_port_by_network from returning
the DVR SNAT port. However, the same thing can be
achieved by making _find_ipv6_router_port_by_network
just check that the interface matches the expected
device owner for regular router interfaces before
returning it.

This function is the last inherited function in the
DVR mixin other than _get_device_owner.
Once a solution for _get_device_owner and the
router extra attributes processing is found, all of
this code can be moved out of the mixin in to the
DVR driver.

Neutron is strict in what it accepts, so
openstack.network.create_port is failing with an HttpException and
details about unrecognized attributes when setting, e.g.,
binding_vnic_type. This is because the old resource class, which network
is currently based on, didn't transform binding_vnic_type into
binding:vnic_type, it just sent both of them.

While https://review.openstack.org/#/c/364052 will solve this in the
long term by transitioning to resource2, where we don't have this sort
of problem with sending extra names, we would need to wait for it and
all other related changes to merge and also be released, so I'd prefer
to make this small change that will tie us over until that larger effort
is completed. This shouldn't affect that change much as this is just
adding an extra method on the Port class, not changing anything else in
the prop names.

We want to update both the attach_volume API and

- Update attach_volume() with versionedobjects
- Update detach_volume() with versionedobjects
- Update test cases related to attach_volume()
  and detach_volume() in file

This patch updates attach_volume API to use
volume versionedobjects.  Changes were made to
be backwards compatible with older RPC clients.
It only includes changes to the core cinder code.
Changes in the drivers are left to each driver
maintainer to update.

synchronize the deletion of the objects between the controllers

fails consistently in tripleo as you can see in the logs at

Adding the sleep makes the HA proxy have enough time to sync
the deletion of the objects, and the container is deleted

The device count process can be quite slow on a system with
lots of interfaces. Doing this during report_state can block
it long enough that the agent will be reported as dead and
bindings will fail.

This adjusts the logic to only update the configuration during
the normal device retrieval for the scan loop. This will leave
the report_state loop unblocked by the operation so the agent
doesn't get reported as dead (which blocks port binding).

common.get_instance() raises a single exception HTTPNotFound only,

This patch moves these calls from the block so that we will be
able to avoid digging what exceptions are raised on the method in
the future (On Ie1fc20fe5e028dd53116d5549814442232ddfe49 review,

This patch removes the need of having dictcompat from
the image object. Luckily we have around 5 objects in
zun that would need this changes.

DictCompat is not really needed, since that's the old
way of referencing an object field just like a dictionary
object in python.

Currently a better way needs to be implemented to avoid
conversion of the image object to a dict
back and forth. This could be achieved if we implement
the API validation blueprint.

This adds a janitor worker to the L3 DB module that
will run every 5 minutes looking for floating IP ports
with the device_id of 'PENDING'. If it finds any, it
will keep track of the port ID to see if any stay in
'PENDING' with the next iteration.

If the device ID is still PENDING after 5 minutes, it
means one of two things has happened. Either the server
died after creating the floating IP port, but before
creating the floating IP itself; or, it died after creating
the floating IP port and the floating IP record, but before
updating the device_id of the floating IP port to the
floating IP ID.

The janitor handles both cases by deleting the floating IP
port if it has no associated floating IP and by updating
the floating IP port device ID if it does have an associated
floating IP.

This change adds a NIC config to the multiple-nics sample NIC
config templates for a compute node running DVR. In order for
DVR to work on the compute nodes, they must share an external
bridge with the controllers. All of the other sample NIC
configs already have an external bridge (defaults to 'br-ex'),
but the multiple-nics compute role does not, so now the
compute-dvr.yaml NIC template will demonstrate DVR with
multiple NICs.

*********** For illustration purposes only ***********

This is just a quick hack to share with an alternate approach
to the attach flow in Cinder.  It's not tested, doesn't have
a nova branch yet, and likely has some holes in it.

The purpose however is to contrast condensing init/attach and
term/detach (V2 attach flow proposal) and a less dramatic change
that for the most part just cleans up the flow we already have,
gets rid of all the crazy ``if this-param: elif that-param...``

This approach tries to simplify things, store a connector and access
records strictly by attachment_id.  This also would take previous
ideas around how to do multi-attach and clean them up making it
easier to achieve that goal.

Latest modifications:
----------------------
10/6/16
  Added the no-connect flag to deal with attaching to
  shelved instances.  Uses an update_attachment to update
  and perform the connection on unshelve, also fixes the
  problem of detaching from a shelved instance that was
  never unshelved
---------------------

This patch aims to make the attach/detach process a bit
simpler and less prone to race conditions and solve
some confusion in it's usage.

For the first step we aren't implementing much, just
some new calls for attach and detach.  We'll call them
create/remove_attachment for now, and they'll just consolidate
all of the calls we used to make.

For example, instead of:
 1. reserve
 2. initialize
 3. attach

We'll just call create_attachment(volume, connector,
                                  instance_uuid, mountpoint)

For now that will simply call the existing initialize_connection
and attach methods, but the advantage here is it's a single call
for the consumer, and more importantly we can require all of the
various info we need up front.  This solves things like
multi-attach problems, because now we have all the info from
initialize, when we make the call to attach.

Eventually the old steps should be reimplemented and made more
efficient than they are currently, but if we get past this first
step we can have a stable, easy to use API to work off of that
shouldn't have to change AND best of all we don't break any
compatability.

There are several OpenStack projects which use novaclient multiple times.
Each time new instance of novaclient is created and each time method
discover_extensions is called.

`discover_extensions` can take some ""real"" time to discover extensions via
python path and entry points. To reduce this time, let's cache the results.

Avoid using of schema reflection when we don't really need it (we
already have this data in SQLAlchemy metadata produced from model
definitions). In other cases we can only reflect only the pieces we
need, like table table names instead of full tables metadata.

It's not crucial when tests are run against an in-memory SQLite DB,
but still allows to get a short cut in CPU time and memory usage
(5.8s vs 7.5s or ~22%, ~2 MB of RAM when running only these tests
with testtools).

This bug happens when using libvirt/QEMU and image_type=rbd.

Rescue instance creates a rescue kernel and ramdisk disk in local.
It will also creates a rescue disk which will saved in ceph by rbd.
When users want to unrescue instance, nova will remove all rescue kernel
and ramdisk disk in local.
But rescue disk which was created in rescue step will still exist.

Because of unrescue action will remove local rescue file and lvm disk
but it didn't remove rbd disk. Therefore we need to add libvirt

In fact, Quotas.count() always returns 0 although InstanceGroup.add_members()
