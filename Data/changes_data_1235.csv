Since our upgrade tarball has both upgraders for master node and
openstack upgrader, we should provide a way to run only certain
ones. For instance, it's a very useful workflow when we can run
just openstack upgrader to test openstack patching.

Upgraders to run could be specified throughout special env variable,
which is widespread way to parametrize some process in Unix world:

Usage example:

    $ UPGRADERS='openstack' ./upgrade.sh

The command above will run just openstack upgrader, no matter which
upgraders was hardcoded in upgrade.sh.

This changeset introduces iniset_sudo, a root wrapper around the
devstack function, iniset.

The wrapper function makes it easier to have comments explaining
lines changes to configuration files.

Instead of sourcing the devstack library in the root environment as
well, iniset_sudo works on a temporary copy of the configuration file
and uses root privileges only to copy the result back into place. It
would have to be modified before it could edit files that the script
user has no permission to read.

The changeset illustrates the use of the function with a patched
apt_install_mysql.sh

Powering off a VM without giving the Guest Operating system a chance
to perform a controlled shutdown can lead to data corruption.

The proposed changes will make the default behavior for stop, rescue, resize,
and shelve to give the GuestOS a chance to perform a controlled shutdown
before the VM is powered off.

The change will encapsulate the complexity of signaling to and waiting for
the GuestOS in the hypervisor, and allow image owners the ability to tune
the associated timing via image metadata to take account of GuestOSs that
require an extended period to shutdown (such as Windows).

Users will be able to specify the shutdown behavior on a per operation basis
via a new shutdown_type parameter where, in keeping with the current reboot
operation, a ""soft"" shutdown will give the GuestOS a chance to perform a
clean shutdown, and a ""hard"" shutdown will cause an immediate power off.  The
default behavior will be a ""soft"" shutdown.

which will enable more complex policy rules to be expressed than
with the current code where we pass only a subset of the context
data.

RabbitMQ: advance thru the list of brokers on reconnect

In RabbitMQ implementation, when using multiple rabbit_hosts, we don't want to
immediately retry failed connection for the same failed broker. This was not
the case in existing implementation though, where we've always attempted to
reconnect starting from the first broker in the list of candidates. So if the
first broker failed, we initiated reconnect to the same failed broker.

This change makes reconnect() implementation to select the next broker in the
list. This also means that non-failure reconnect attempts will also switch the
current broker. All in all, users should not rely on any particular order to
use brokers from the list, so this should not constitute an issue.

Code inspection around an exception found a piece of code handling an
error from execute_with_timeout() in a problematic way. A call was
made to delete a file and if the file did not exist,
execute_with_timeout() would throw an exception. However, 'rm' is not
very friendly, and only returns 0, -1, +1 and not errno
(ENOENT). Therefore the code was (literally) looking in stdout for the
string 'No such file or directory'.

The recommended way of handling missing files with rm is to use the
command line '-f' option which will suppress errors on nonexistent
files. The mechanism of searching for a literal string is not good for
a couple of reasons but the most significant two are that it requires
a thrown exception (which would get logged as an exception), and that
in languages other than English, the error string would be something
else (not 'No such file ...').

A test to ensure that wipe_ib_logfiles() properly suppressed the
exception is now redundant and has been deleted.

If the libvirt driver has not been configured to use KVM, then
the libguestfs module should be forced to use TCG. This is
particularly important when running Nova inside a VM, which
might claim to have VMX/SVM support when it is in fact broken.
This will avoid libguestfs hanging in such scenarios.

'rbd list' CLI returns error code when there are no rbd volumes, which
causes problems during live migration of VMs with RBD backed ephemeral
volumes. It's safer to use the library that only raises an exception in
case of a real problem.

The only case where rbd CLI is still justified is import, which is
needed to correctly import sparse image files.

All code related to cleanup of RBD volumes is moved to rbd.py, this
fixes a yo-yo problem with single-use methods scattered across 3
different files, and minimizes impact of this fix on imports in
imagebackend and utils.

On some drivers CHAP credentials are tied to accounts
which may be unique for each OS and/or backend Tenant.

For example:
  Volume is created with project_id xyz
  Backend creates an account for xyz with specific CHAP

  Volume is transferred to project_id abc

Currently we don't update the model_info, so even though
on the backend we updated the owner and CHAP settings we
never propogated that back up to the DB object so the volume
can't be used by the new owner.

This patch just adds an option to return model_update
on the accept_transfer call to the driver and updates
the db accordingly.

Also adds a call in the SF driver to actually get the
new model info to be fed back to the manager.

This patch will allow properly configured Glance servers to return a temporary
URL for an object hosted on Swift. It will require Glance to use Swift
as its backend. A temporary URL allow a deploy driver to download an image
from Glance without requiring an auth_token, which gives access more than
just Glance. This requires a set of config options: the Glance endpoint URL,
a shared secret temporary key, and the account configured in Glance to talk
to Swift with, which owns the container images are stored in.

A later patch will explore using the direct_url in Glance to simplify the
config options.

We/I need to add a note in the docs about Swift being a possible dependency
for Ironic deploys using IPA, along with how to set the Temp URL key.

Swift performance concerns will be addressed in this blueprint:

Previously the policy runtime utilized a handful of special-purpose
interacting theories.  The intent was to explore a number of different options
for monitoring and enforcement.  But for our current focus on
simply monitoring, interacting theories is overly complex; moreover,
it makes it difficult to support multi-tenancy.

This change removes the interacting theories from the policy runtime.
Now every policy is isolated from every other policy. This also
makes multi-tenancy possible.  We've chosen to use the Nonrecursive
Theory as the default.  This avoids stale-state bugs likely
to appear in MaterializedViewTheory, which seems to be a
problem currently.

Sometimes the policy runtime creates new tables from existing table
names.  When it does so for a tablename that references an external
datasource, e.g. neutron:ports, it leaves the datasource prefix
in tact.  This causes the DSE incarnation of the policy engine
to try to create a data source with a non-existent data source
name.

This fix checks if the table-name is auto-generated before
trying to spin up a datasource service.

It is only very slightly less of a security issue to expose
Token IDs in the logs than it is to expose password details. This
change obscures the Token ID in the debug output in all cases to
ensure that the ID is not presented in any of the logs that could
be read by a unprivileged source (e.g. lower priv log watchers,
centralized logging, etc).

The main use case is to ensure that it is possible to correlate a
token to the various requests made. In some cases this has shown
where a token has expired (tokens weren't properly refreshed).
This use case for debugging eliminates simple redaction of the
token id from the logs.

SHA1 is no longer allowed as a hashing mode for CMS token hashing.
This is because SHA1 is being used to obscure tokens in the
session object debug. This is done to  prevent the debug output
from being potentially exposing a valid token (PKI->sha1-short-id)
in some configurations of Keystone / auth_token middleware.

The raw data elements from the token (e.g. user, roles, expiration
etc) could be added into debug/trace level logging at a future time.

UserManager/TenantManager seems private classes in keystoneclient

django-openstack-auth tests actually don't need these managers,

It prevents setting defined storage engine for created tables.

Issue with ummutable dict was discovered during testing of

The error handling code that gets connections reset if necessary
caught ConnectionError. It really needs to catch MessagingError,
which ConnectionError inherits from. There are other types of
MessagingErrors that may occur, such as InternalError, and they need
to cause the connection to reset, as well.

This fix has already been merged into oslo.messaging.

and is read from the error message using regular expressions.

The duplicated value can't be extracted from SQLite error messages,
so we do our best here for other db backends that we support.

Includes ""Don't match editor backup files in environment"" and ""Order
execution of environment.d scripts"". These had to be squashed because
the first change alone changes the order env.d scripts are sourced in.

The current glob match for environment files can source editor backup
files (foo.bash~) which will override the real changes you have made.
Other parts use the regex to avoid matching such files, so do
the same for environment file matching.  Note this has to match "".""
unlike the other regex, as most env files are ""foo.bash""

Also sort the files before sourcing them to ensure a reliable order.
This change should be in line with current expectations, given the
convention is to numerically prefix scripts in this directory.

Python 3 introduced a next() function to replace the next()
method on iterator objects. Rather than calling the method on the
iterator, the next() function is called with the iterable object
as it's sole parameter, which calls the underlying __next__() method.

As the next() function was backported to Python 2.6, we can
use it either in the 2.x or 3.x simultaneously - that's why
six.next() usage was also removed from the source code.

New tox (>=1.7.0) sets a random python hash seed by default. This is
generally good for testing because it will help keep projects working
regardless of the hash seed, but ceilometer unittests don't currently
pass with a random hash seed so set it to the python default seed.

This change will allow us to use new tox again and remove the
restriction on tox<=1.6.1 to run unittests.

Redundant setenvs for specific test envs are removed to prevent them
from overriding the PYTHONHASHSEED value.

Note this change will need to be backported to the stable branches to
keep unittests there working with new tox as well.

When using version >= 2.2 of the MySQL module, setting up
the database for Keystone depended on the MySQL service
(Service['mysqld']). However, if the service is not managed
by Puppet (e.g. it is managed through Pacemaker instead),
this would cause catalog compilation to fail because there
is no Service['mysqld']. This is the case when the MySQL

During the refactoring of the conductor_workers parameter from nova::api
to nova::conductor, the conductor_workers default changed from
$::processorcount to the parameter being absent.

While this is consistent with the nova default behaviour, it changes the
value for people who currently have a different default set. The solution is
to do nothing, in case no value is given.

This patch adds an osbash support library for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

It allows osbash to build basedisks based on that distribution.

The patch also documents the new option in localrc.

Note that the new library differs from the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS version only
in the URL of the ISO image. The URL could be passed as an argument and
both libraries merged. Such a refactoring can be undertaken later on,
should we keep adding libraries we almost identical content.

Also note that these libraries do not pass bashate (formerly know as
bash8). Maybe we can find a better way to store the boot argument string
that is bashate conformant, readable/editable, and correct code.

This draft represents a combination of the work done in two earlier
versions of the resolution ([anteaya][eglynn]) and notes from the
TC meeting on 8 July 2014 ([logs][markmc]).

This version adds details based on the background for each position,
so that readers who have not followed the discussion will have a
better understanding of why we are talking about these issues. It
also tries to provide a clear reporting structure and cover some
of the technicalities of who can administer the election while some
members of the TC are running.

It also focuses on resolving issues amicably and educating the
community, rather than publicizing faults in a way that may punish
someone harshly for a simple mistake. I think this is in keeping
with the ""benefit of the doubt"" attitude I sensed from the most
recent meeting.

New tox (>=1.7.0) sets a random python hash seed by default. This is
generally good for testing because it will help keep projects working
regardless of the hash seed, but cinder unittests don't currently pass
with a random hash seed so set it to the python default seed.

This change will allow us to use new tox again and remove the
restriction on tox<=1.6.1 to run unittests.

Redundant setenvs for specific test envs are removed to prevent them
from overriding the PYTHONHASHSEED value.

Note this change will need to be backported to the stable branches to
keep unittests there working with new tox as well.

When passing bad body in a request, most APIs return BadRequest response.
However, agents API doesn't do it.
This patch fixes the error status code and adds a unit test related to
this change.

This patch's idea most came from
Ken'ichi Ohmichi's patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/107266/

An empty recordset is just a logical entity with a given record type.
Right now we save the recordset name and type even when it is a null set,
thus preventing us from re-using the name as a different type (eg. A to
CNAME). It would be better to check for this empty recordset condition
and delete if possible, rather than throwing error 400.
This commit also adds CNAME type to Record and RecordSet fixtures

Currently _create_port_for_vip calls ml2 create_port() method

The patch fixes that while making VIP creation process non-atomic.
But that is fine as long until create_vip() returns vip id, it's

Adds context tracking decorators that were missing
from router interface methods. Without them, new
sessions were being created instead of using the
existing context which was causing transaction
issues.

Modifies the servermanager to store context references
as weakrefs so if multiple functions are called before
the rest functions are called, the first one doesn't steal
the only context reference with a pop() call.

Removes a DB lock for update in the server manager that occured
during rest calls that was triggering deadlocks due to the
file lock synchronization for the rest calls.

The current cloning process in the LVM
driver uses a snapshot to do the data
copy in the background.  Trouble here
is that if the creation or activation
of the new volume fails, we don't
cleanup the snapshot we created.

Just move the create_volume and activate
calls down into the try block so the finally
clause can do the cleanup for us.

requests-mock is a mocking layer for the requests package. It is
Apache-2 licensed.

The httpretty library has been used to provide a mocking layer for HTTP
requests. This has generally been successful however there have been a
number of problems with it over our usage, including poor python 3
support and a number of backwards incompatible releases from the
maintainer. It is also difficult to package by distributions.

httpretty was particularly chosen because it was compatible with both
httplib and requests, this is no longer such a requirement as almost all
OpenStack libraries have now moved to requests. Given that we can move
to a library with less complexity and more inline with OpenStack tools.

It is written in such a way that it is fairly simple to convert existing
httpretty test suites or httmock test suites to requests-mock.

I am the author of requests-mock and am also happy to move it to
stackforge, or otherwise connect it to gerrit so as we will not have any
future incompatible issues.

More info:
 - https://github.com/jamielennox/requests-mock
 - http://requests-mock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

This would ideally not need to be in the icehouse branch however grenade
and other gate tests all run with the most current client release and so
require that the dependencies of the client match what is in the
requirements.

eventually going through keystone.tests.test_v3.v3_request().
The v3_request method always requires an auth token by default.
But since V3 auth token API is an unprotected API, there's no need
for an auth token in order to make the request.

Currently treat_devices_added_or_updated in the OVS agent skips
processing devices which disappeared from the integration bridge
during the agent loop.
This is fine, however the agent should not mark these devices as
processed. Otherwise they won't be processed, should they appear
again on the bridge.

This patch ensures these devices are not added to the current
device set.

The patch also changes treat_devices_added_or_updated. The
function now will return the list of skipped devices and not
anymore a flag signalling whether a resync is required.
With the current logic a resync would be required if retrieval
of device details fails. With this change, the function
treat_devices_added_or_updated will raise in this case and the
exception will be handled in process_network_ports.

For the sake of consistency, this patch also updates the
similar function treat_ancillary_devices_added in order to
use the same logic.

Finally, this patch amends an innaccurate related comment.

Closes-Bug: #1329546

Conflicts:
	neutron/plugins/openvswitch/agent/ovs_neutron_agent.py

Required changes:
- fetch all device details first before proceeding with handling ports
  to reflect Juno behaviour.
- unit test was modified to run with get_device_details since
  get_devices_details_list is not available in Icehouse.
- fixed E128 violation in the backported code.

New tox (>=1.7.0) sets a random python hash seed by default. This is
generally good for testing because it will help keep projects working
regardless of the hash seed, but neutron unittests don't currently pass
with a random hash seed so set it to the python default seed.

This change will allow us to use new tox again and remove the
restriction on tox<=1.6.1 to run unittests.

Note this change will need to be backported to the stable branches to
keep unittests there working with new tox as well.

This adds record and domain deletion to the designate.sh devstack
exercise.  This also adds DNS checking for the domain/record operations,
to verify that the changes were made in DNS.  Some functions in
designate.sh were moved to lib/designate and refactored slightly.
This also removes some IPA variables that were refactored into a
backend specific file, and fixes a bug in the ipa backend file.

of this model works similarly to the AccessInfo model from

This patch fixes three issues that combined to break tunnel networks.

The first issue was the the failure mode was being set on the
integration bridge after the canary flow was installed. This
immediately wiped out the canary flow.

The second problem was that the main loop would sync tunnel networks
right before resetting the tunnel bridge when the canary flow was
missing. This meant that it would sync all of the tunnels via RPC and
then wipe them out.

The final issue was that after resetting the tunnel bridge in the
main loop, the tunnel_sync variable was not set to True, so the
tunnels would never be resynchronized.

This patch addresses the three issues in the following ways:
1. Set the failure mode on the bridge before the canary flow is
installed.
2. Run the OVS restart logic before the tunnel synchronization.
3. If the restart logic is triggered, set tunnel_sync to True to
trigger synchronization.

Previously, whenever auto_schedule_networks() networks would be called
it would move networks that were mapped to one dhcp-agent to another
dhcp-agent if there status was reporting down. The problem with this
is that it didn't remove the network mapping from the previous dhcp-agent.
Since the status implementation on the agents isn't very robust eventually
all networks will be mapped to every dhcp-agent. This patch avoids
this by not taking the status into account for networks that already
exist. Newly created networks though will be mapped to agents with an
active status.

This reverts commit bfec80a776a53b554a8f2d023d2974539edef3ce.

This patch needs to be reverted until we resolve the issue with
patch 109180.

The previous change introduced a situation where we can only
override the default server side setting from the client side
for ""--distributed"" when the default is False. But we cannot
override when the default is True.

This is a requirement for DVR and at the same time we don't
want to introduce any new changes that would affect any current
plugins. So we will decide on it later and in the mean while I
will revert it.

Calculates an exponential backoff delay with jitter for retrying
operations which might fail.

The exponential delay on each attempt gives the service a chance
to process its backlog of retries after it starts responding again.

The jitter adds some randomness to the delay to prevent
multiple synchronised backoff retries from hitting the
service at exactly the same time.

The next change in this series makes use of this function.

Barbican repo method find_by_keystone_id will check the DB for a
tenant ID.  It also takes a flag, supress_exception, so that a
""tenant not found"" type of error won't result in an exception
being percolated to its caller.

When the query is done for a tenant that has never been used
it will raise a NoResultFound which gets caught and only
percolated if the supress_exception flag is false.

Previous to this change, we would log this NoResultFound which
in many cases is expected behaviour (hence the supress_exception
flag).  This could be confusing for someone looking at barbican
logs (or an automated log crawler) since this exception is actually
expected behaviour.

This change moves the logging of the exception so that it only
happens if the supress_exception flag is false.  This keeps these
expected exceptions out of the logs.
