In order to do more sophisticated scheduling (e.g. schedule based on volume
type), filter scheduler is introduced. Several changes are made to make this
possible, some of them are similar to the counterpart in Nova:

- add HostState class to host_manager in order to store volume capabilities
- implement get_volume_stats() method of iSCSIDriver as an example to
demonstrate how volume backend driver reports capabilities as well as status
- add scheduler_options.py and 'scheduler_json_config_location' flag to be
allow loading json configuration file for scheduler at run time
- port common filters/weights from oslo
- add capacity weigher (scheduler/weights/capacity.py) for picking up
target volume backend by weighing free capacity of the host. The default
behavior is to spread volumes across hosts; by changing the
'capacity_weight_multiplier' to negative number, volume placing behavior will
become stacking.
- add capacity filter which filters those hosts have insufficient storage space
to serve the request.
- add 'reserved_percentage' config option to indicate how much space is
reserved. Capacity reservation is needed when volume resize is enabled.
- add 'publish_service_capabilities()' method to volume RPC API to allow
scheduler to have volume service report capabilities. This bumps volume RPC
API to version 1.2
- remove 'volume_force_update_capabilities' config option, volume status will be
report to scheduler in every checking.

The implication of this change to storage/backend driver developer:
- implementation of get_volume_stats() of the driver is now a *MUST*, filter
scheduler heavily relies on the status/capabilities reported by backend driver
to makeplacement decision.  To ensure Cinder works seamlessly on the storage
system, driver should at least report following capabilities/status:
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  Capability/Status   |      Description          |         Example
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
 'volume_backend_name'| back-end name, string     | 'Example_Storage_Backend'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'vendor_name'       | vendor name, string       | 'OpenStackCinder'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'driver_version'    | version, string           |  '1.0a'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'storage_protocol'  | supported protocols,      | 'iSCSI', 'RBD', 'FC', 'NFS'
                      | string or list of strings | ['iSCSI', 'NFS', 'FC']
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'total_capacity_gb' | capacity in GB, integer   |  102400
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'free_capacity_gb'  | available capacity in GB, |  1000
                      | integer                   |
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
'reserved_percentage' | reserved space in         |  0, 10
                      | percentage, integer       |
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------

The implication of this change to Cinder administrator:
- the default setting for filter scheduler should work well with the benefits
of:
  * being able to fully utilize capacity of backends (driver now has to report
  actul total space and space utilization and scheduler uses these info) not
  limited by the 'max_gigabytes' config option any more;
  * being able to choose placement policy between spreading & stacking for
  volume creation (by modifying the 'capacity_weight_multiplier' in
  CapacityWeigher)
- with filter scheduler, Cinder is now able to utilize the advanced features/
capabilities provided by different storage back-ends via: defining different
volume types with proper extra_specs. Volume types can be considered as sets
of back-end capabilities requirement.
 For example, a volume type which has 'storage_protocol':'FC' key/value pair
definition in its extra_spec can only be served by those back-ends who report
they support FiberChannel protocol. Another example is volume type has 'QoS'
requirement can only be served by back-ends support QoS.

Note/TODO:
* Currently scheduler makes its decision based on the status and capabilities
information reported by volume nodes, and these information is stored in memory
of scheduler process. More sophisticated way may be add on table in DB to
record status/capabilities of all volume nodes, like Nova does for compute nodes.

Some operators have made some choices in their underlying MySQL architecture,
which our helpful assertion that they want to run on InnoDB breaks.

Add an option to nova which will allow such operators to tell us what they
want to run on. This is an advanced option and assumes that they know what
they are doing and defaults to the easy and sane choice of InnoDB.

The baremetal hypervisor tracks references to instances which are
deleted asynchronously from the commit to the nova bm. As such, its a
normal but rare condition for a bare metal node to refer to a deleted
(and even garbage collected) nova instance. We should treat such

list_instances(), permitting starting new instances and listing

In order to do more sophisticated scheduling (e.g. schedule based on volume
type), filter scheduler is introduced. Several changes are made to make this
possible, some of them are similar to the counterpart in Nova:

- add HostState class to host_manager in order to store volume capabilities
- implement get_volume_stats() method of iSCSIDriver as an example to
demonstrate how volume backend driver reports capabilities as well as status
- add scheduler_options.py and 'scheduler_json_config_location' flag to be
allow loading json configuration file for scheduler at run time
- port common filters/weights from oslo
- add capacity weigher (scheduler/weights/capacity.py) for picking up
target volume backend by weighing free capacity of the host. The default
behavior is to spread volumes across hosts; by changing the
'capacity_weight_multiplier' to negative number, volume placing behavior will
become stacking.
- add capacity filter which filters those hosts have insufficient storage space
to serve the request.
- add 'reserved_percentage' config option to indicate how much space is
reserved. Capacity reservation is needed when volume resize is enabled.
- change default scheduler to 'filter.FilterScheduler'.
- add 'publish_service_capabilities()' method to volume RPC API to allow
scheduler to have volume service report capabilities. This bumps volume RPC
API to version 1.2
- remove 'volume_force_update_capabilities' config option, volume status will be
report to scheduler in every checking.

The implication of this change to storage/backend driver developer:
- implementation of get_volume_stats() of the driver is now a *MUST*, filter
scheduler heavily relies on the status/capabilities reported by backend driver
to makeplacement decision.  To ensure Cinder works seamlessly on the storage
system, driver should at least report following capabilities/status:
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  Capability/Status   |      Description          |         Example
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
 'volume_backend_name'| back-end name, string     | 'Example_Storage_Backend'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'vendor_name'       | vendor name, string       | 'OpenStackCinder'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'driver_version'    | version, string           |  '1.0a'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'storage_protocol'  | supported protocols,      | 'iSCSI', 'RBD', 'FC', 'NFS'
                      | string or list of strings | ['iSCSI', 'NFS', 'FC']
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'total_capacity_gb' | capacity in GB, integer   |  102400
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'free_capacity_gb'  | available capacity in GB, |  1000
                      | integer                   |
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
'reserved_percentage' | reserved space in         |  0, 10
                      | percentage, integer       |
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------

The implication of this change to Cinder administrator:
- the default setting for filter scheduler should work well with the benefits
of:
  * being able to fully utilize capacity of backends (driver now has to report
  actul total space and space utilization and scheduler uses these info) not
  limited by the 'max_gigabytes' config option any more;
  * being able to choose placement policy between spreading & stacking for
  volume creation (by modifying the 'capacity_weight_multiplier' in
  CapacityWeigher)
- with filter scheduler, Cinder is now able to utilize the advanced features/
capabilities provided by different storage back-ends via: defining different
volume types with proper extra_specs. Volume types can be considered as sets
of back-end capabilities requirement.
 For example, a volume type which has 'storage_protocol':'FC' key/value pair
definition in its extra_spec can only be served by those back-ends who report
they support FiberChannel protocol. Another example is volume type has 'QoS'
requirement can only be served by back-ends support QoS.

Note/TODO:
* Currently scheduler makes its decision based on the status and capabilities
information reported by volume nodes, and these information is stored in memory
of scheduler process. More sophisticated way may be add on table in DB to
record status/capabilities of all volume nodes, like Nova does for compute nodes.

These tables will be a place to record actions taken on an instance, and
related underlying events.  This will provide a log of what has taken
place which can aid in debugging or just satisfy curiosity.  It will
also hold error information in the event that something exceptional
occurs during the action.  This is setting up the ability to report
error information without needing to set the VM to an ERROR state.

implements blueprint hp3par-volume-driver

We have the driver broken into 2 files:
hp_3par_common.py and
hp_3par_iscsi.py

The reason we do this is because we have a fibre channel driver
that will be submitted shortly after this is committed.   The
fibre channel driver and the iscsi driver share a lot of the same
code that talks to the 3PAR array for provisioning.  So,
it made sense not to have duplicate code.  The fibre channel driver
will be dependent on the fibre channel support I am actively working
on for nova/cinder grizzly release.

The driver uses a 2 mechanisms to talk to the 3PAR array:
1) a python REST client (hp3parclient) that lives in the pypi
   repository here:
   http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hp3parclient

2) SSH.  We had to pull in some of the ssh code from the base san
   driver to help fix an issue with executing commands on the 3PAR
   array.  The 3PAR has the ability to turn on CSV output for command
   results, which makes this easier to parse.  Unfortunately, there
   is no way to turn CSV mode on permanently for all ssh requests.
   So, we have to turn on the CSV output for every single ssh command
   issued.  Since we use ssh as well, we require the san_* options
   to be set.

We use a dual mechianism because the REST API that ships with the 3.1.2
firmware doesn't support all of the capabilities a cinder driver needs
to export volumes.

When a newer version of the firmware comes out that supports host
management on the 3PAR array, then we will get rid of the SSH code.

Currently, horizon reboots instance via the 'HARD' mode which
stops instance by destroying it. This would trigger some unusual
behavior for instance(such as reboots twice due to fsck). Nova has
provided scheme to reboot instance in the 'SOFT' mode, which is
more elegant. Thus it is reasonable for us to switch to the 'SOFT'

Instead of having a servers controller that has parsing and
validation of the input wsgi request objects it is useful to
start to centralize this code into a API controller and then
hand-off the objects recieved to a set of request marshaling objects
whose sole job is to validate the input request (using shared
validation methods) and form objects for the API controller
to use.

This commit does this for the following methods:

1. 'index', 'detail' via a common 'SearchUnmarshaller'
2. 'create' via a 'CreateUnmarshaller'
3. 'update' via a 'UpdateUnmarshaller'
4. 'changePassword' via a 'ChangePasswordUnmarshaller'

Add a new middleware implementing some basic container quotas.

Quotas are subject to several limitations: eventual consistency, the timeliness
of the cached container_info (60 second ttl by default), and it’s unable to
reject chunked transfer uploads that exceed the quota (though once the quota
is exceeded, new chunked transfers will be refused).

However, they get most of the way to container quotas fairly inexpensively.

Quotas are set by adding meta values to the container, and are validated when
set:

  X-Container-Meta-Quota-Bytes: Maximum size of the container, in bytes.
  X-Container-Meta-Quota-Count: Maximum object count of the container.

This is the final step in enabling availability_zones using aggregate
metadata. Previously all services had an availability_zone, but the
availability_zone is only used for nova-compute.  Services such as
nova-scheduler, nova-network, nova-conductor have always spanned all
availability_zones.

After this change only compute nodes (nova-compute), will have an
availability_zone. In order to preserve current APIs, when running:
* nova host-list (os-hosts)
* euca-describe-availability-zones verbose
* nova-manage service list
Internal services will appear in there own internal availability_zone
(CONF.internal_service_availability_zone)
Internal zone is hidden in euca-describe-availability_zones
(non-verbose)

CONF.node_availability_zone has been renamed to
CONF.default_availability_zone and is only used by the nova-api and
nova-scheduler. CONF.node_availability_zone still works but is
deprecated

Instead of implementing availability zones in the service table,
availability zones are implemented using general aggregate metadata.

This patch does not remove availability zones from the service table, a
latter patch will do that.

* In theory supports a single compute node in multiple availability zones
* Drop availability_zone column from Aggregate table (is now a property)
* map aggregate metadata 'availability_zone' so API does not change

For some reason that isn't entirely clear to me, the attempt to update
instance metadata in _instance_update() results in a stale sqlalchemy
object state. This is a similar issue to the one fixed in commit:

  9fdf7552779d518af9cda4e366bf81fddb0cb6f2

For some reason, session.refresh() doesn't work for instance['metadata']
in the same way, which also raises suspicion that perhaps it's not the
right fix for system_metadata either.

This patch adds an _instance_update_metadata_in_place() method that
updates the actual instance['metadata'] list _and_ the database,
mirroring the high-level behavior of instance_metadata_update(), but
without requiring us to refresh or re-fetch the metadata or the
whole instance (as a workaround).

Initial draft to support multiple publication, for review only.

Don't want to use ""git review -D"", to involve more public
discussion.

Three components are involved: pollster, transformer and publisher.

Pollster will collect raw data from sources like nova etc, and then
feed that information into transformer, which act as a bridge between
pollster and publisher.

The transformer will translate the raw data into publisher-specific
counter, like metering data for billing or metric for CW. Each transformer
can support multiple pollster input, and also output to multiple publisher.

Publisher will send the counter out with publisher specific conduits.

This will also make interaction with nova simple, we can potentially use
one pollster to get all information from nova, with one API, and different
transfomer will handle Disk, CPU, memory etc. And admin can disable the
transfomers through configure files.

Several thing ahead if this method is ok:
a) change the libvirt pollster, to provide more raw data. For example,
   currently DiskIOPollster will caculate all disk access, however, this
   aggregation can be done in transfomer, while pollster can pass per-disk IO
   access information as is.
b) Remove ceilometer/publish.py
c) Change the notification also if needed
d) Add config optioin to transformer, so that it can decide publishers that
   should be disabled.

Updates the Nova conductor so that it uses instance_get_all()
and instance_get_all_by_host() from the Nova DB API to
implement its own like named functions.

This fixes a regression that occured in d22b0ca where we switched
from using the DB API's instance_get_all_by_host and instance_get_all
methods over to the DB APIs instance_get_all_by_filters.

This caused some subtle regressions due to the fact that
instance_get_all_by_filters has different defaults for
deleted records.

The previously used (prior to d22b0ca) instance_get_all() and
instance_get_all_by_host() functions rely on the context.read_deleted
and also handle the display of deleted and soft deleted records differently.

When the rpc message envelope patch went in, the serialization done in
impl_zmq was replaced with what is done in rpc.common.  Instead, it just
needs to be done as an additional stage of serialization.  The reason is
that the amqp drivers can handle passing dicts into the messaging
libraries.  The zeromq library can not handle that, so it has to ensure
it is a string before passing it down to the library.

This patch restores the original (unmodified) _serialize() and
_deserialize() methods in impl_zmq that were removed and calls them as
appropriate.

Nested stack templates (e.g WordPress_Composed_Instances.template)

returns a string ""None"" for Outputs.* which will allow template
validation to succeed, and will still return the actual output when
the nested stack has actually been created.

responsibility of each storage driver to a common location.

This patch introduces a new base exception StoreException.  This object
has the member 'uri'.  It is subclassed by relevant storage related
exceptions.  When a StorageFull exception is thrown by a storage module
the member variable uri is checked.  If it is not None a locations is
created and passed back into the storage modules delete method for
cleanup.  Some modules do not need cleanup on error (like s3).  Those
modules simply leave the uri parameter as None when creating the
StorageFull exception.  Currently the only module that throws the
StorageFull is the file system module.

Glance CLI programs list '--version' as an option in the output from

because the option parsing tools expect the given version to be a string,
but glance returns a duck type of a string.  The parsing tools later call
replace() and that object and because it is not there an exception is
thrown.  This patch adds the replace() method to the version object.

This patch syncs the latest changes to rpc and notifier from
oslo-incubator.  The most significant changes are for adding support for
a message envelope for all messages, including notifications, sent via
rpc.

Related oslo-incubator reviews:

    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/17554/
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/18057/

Note that a new notifier module was added: rpc_notifier2, which when
used, sends notifications out with a message envelope.

DocImpact.

Implements bp version-rpc-messages.

This patch allows for managing service types through the API.

The patch also provides a 'dummy' API extension, which uses the
'dummy' service plugin, as a PoC for usage of service type.
The dummy API extension is used in unit tests only.

Previously the default test behavior was to capture stdout and stderr.
Make the new default to not capture stdout and stderr then set
.testr.conf to always capture these streams when running tests under
testr.

The motiviation behind this change is that you will want these streams
to be captured when running under testr, but when not running under
testr you may not want to capture them. An example of this would be
running `python -m testtools.run test_name` with a change to test_name
to invoke the python debugger (capturing stdout and stderr interferes
with normal debugger functionality).

Also, only invoke the test timeout by default when running under testr.
This is done for the same reason as above. When running a test under the
debugger the timeout interferes with debugging.

Update compute's init_host() to get the list of instances on this host
via the conductor service.  This removes a db read from compute.

Most of the test fixes are to ensure conductor is running anywhere that
compute is running.  The EC2 availability zones test change (from 13 to
15) is because this output includes info on each service that's running,
so running nova-conductor in this test suite added more info here.

Note that this uses the previously-added ping() call in conductor to
determine when the service is available. The compute manager pings the
conductor every ten seconds for ten attempts and then falls back to the
default configured RPC timeout. This should be a reasonable compromise
between requiring strict service startup ordering and extreme delays.

fixes bug 1096486

The previous code used a special extension loading mechanism to
selectively load the Quota model is the plugin matched and object path.
This was intended to load models required by plugins, but this loading
actually occurred after the db schema was created, so the model was not
always loaded.  This fix refactors the code to make the QuotaV2 ext
behave similarly to the other extensions ensuring the models are loaded
prior to database schema creation.

The LibvirtOpenVswitchVirtualPortDriver VIF driver and the

based guest configs. The only difference is that the former
uses libvirt's modern <network type='bridge'> with vport
profile specified, while the latter uses <network type='ethernet'>
and does all openvswitch setup itself. The reason for the latter
is to support running against libvirt versions older than 0.9.11

Rather than require the host admin to figure this out themselves,
merge the two classes together and automatically choose the right
impl based on the libvirt version we're running against

The LibvirtOpenVswitchVirtualPortDriver class is kept around as
a trivial subclass of LibvirtOpenVswitchDriver for backwards
compatibility. It will be removed in the Hxxx release.

This review allows periodic tasks to be enabled or disabled in the
decorator, as well as by specifying an interval which is negative.

The spacing between runs of a periodic task is now specified in
seconds, with zero meaning the default spacing which is currently 60
seconds.

There is also a new argument to the decorator which indicates if a
periodic task _needs_ to be run in the nova-compute process. There is
also a flag (run_external_periodic_tasks) which can be used to move
these periodic tasks out of the nova-compute process.

I also remove the periodic_interval flag to services, as the interval
between runs is now dynamic based on the number of seconds that a
periodic task wants to wait for its next run. For callers who want to
twiddle the sleep period (for example unit tests), there is a
create() argument periodic_interval_max which lets the period
periodic_tasks() specifies be overridden. This is not exposed as a
flag because I cannot see a use case for that. It is needed for unit
testing however.

This introduces *EXPERIMENTAL* compute cells functionality as a way to
scale nova in a more distributed fashion without having to use complicated
technologies like DB and message queue clustering.

Cells are configured as a tree and the top level cell should contain
nova-api without any nova-computes while child cells contain everything
except nova-api.  One can think of a cell as a normal nova deployment in
that each cell has its own DB server and message queue broker.

The top level cell keeps a subset of data about ALL instances in all
cells in its DB.  Child cells send messages to the top level cell when
instances change state.  Data in 1 child cell is not shared with another
child cell.

A new service, nova-cells, is introduced that handles communication
between cells and picking of a cell for new instances.  This service is
required for every cell.  Communication between cells is pluggable with
the only option currently implemented being communnication via RPC.

Cells scheduling is separate from host scheduling.  nova-cells first picks
a cell (currently randomly -- future patches add filtering/weighing
functionality and decisions can be based on broadcasts of
capacity/capabilities).  Once a cell has been selected and the new build
request has reached its nova-cells service, it'll be sent over to the host
scheduler in that cell and the build proceeds as it does without cells.

New config options are introduced for enabling and configuring the cells
code.  Cells is disabled by default.  All of the config options below go
under a '[cells]' section in nova.conf.  These are the options that one
may want to tweak:

enable -- Turn on cells code (default is False)
name -- Name of the current cell.
capabilities -- List of arbitrary key=value pairs defining capabilities
                of the current cell.  These are sent to parent cells,
                but aren't used in scheduling until later filter/weight
                support is added.
call_timeout -- How long to wait for replies from a calls between cells

When using cells, the compute API class must be changed in the API cell,
so that requests can be proxied via nova-cells down to the correct cell
properly.  Thus, config requirements for API cell:

--
[DEFAULT]
compute_api_class=nova.compute.cells_api.ComputeCellsAPI.
[cells]
enable=True
name=api-cell
--

Config requirements for child cell:

--
[cells]
enable=True
name=child-cell1
--

Another requirement is populating the 'cells' DB table in each cell.
Each cell needs to know about its parent and children and how to
communicate with them (message broker location, credentials, etc).

The VIF driver QuantumVIFDriver has been added. This currently supports the
following vif types: 'ovs' and 'bridge'. Adding support for '802.1qbg' and
'802.1qbh' is pretty straight forward.

The patch does the following:
1. It enables a generic Quantum VIF driver to treat the vNic according to the
   type of vNic (that is, per the vif_type)
2. In order to be backward compatible and to enable plugable vif driver the
   following configuration variables have been added:
   i. libvirt_vif_default - a default driver in the event that the 'vif_type'
      is not received from Quantum (maybe an older version of Quantum)
   ii. libvirt_vif_ovs - the class to handle OVS drivers. This is configurable
      in order to enable the user to work with diffent libvirt versions, different
      OVS implementations etc.
   iii. libvirt_vif_bridge - the class to handle standard linux bridge drivers.

When message envelopes were added for rpc messages, notifications were
explicitly left out.  This was due to the fact that notifications are
consumed outside of OpenStack.  However, notification consumers will
likely want to eventually start taking advantage of some of the features
that the envelope is a prerequisite for, such as message signing.

This patch adds a new notification driver that produces message based
notifications including the message envelope.

the GET /v2/ API call is documented to return urls to both
wadl and pdf documents. However our call returned non working
urls to 1.1 versions of those documents. Fix this.

Also fix the unit tests to actually test the output of versions.
Previously we were over stubbing the test_verions.py so it was
testing only itself, and not the output you'd actually get from
the real versions.py module.

Renamed the variables used for the expected variables to reduce
confusion about what is an expected variable vs. the variables
coming from versions.py to try to ensure we don't have cicular
always passing tests in the future.

This patch adds a single service_get_all_by() method to the
conductor, which services the following database calls:

 - service_get_all()
 - service_get_all_by_topic()
 - service_get_all_by_host()
 - service_get_by_host_and_topic()
 - service_get_all_compute_by_host()

It also makes compute/manager use conductor for this case.
The special case for the service_get_all_compute_by_host() call
is rather unfortunate, and I wonder if it might be okay to (later)
make the generic function automatically joinedload in the compute
case.

It appears that only libvirt implements this method, and the change

mean the consumer attempting to send its reply while other tests

It also makes compute/manager use conductor for these operations, with
one exception. Currently, ComputeManager.init_host () lists all

The compute/manager makes several unnecessary db calls to fetch
the instance system_metadata, which is available in the instance
object itself now. This patch replaces those uses, avoiding the
need to farm them out to conductor.

This patch moves the compute/manager's use of block_device_mapping_destroy
operations to the conductor. Specifically:

 - block_device_mapping_destroy()
 - block_device_mapping_destroy_by_instance_and_device()
 - block_device_mapping_destroy_by_instance_and_volume()

Once again, this just adds a single destroy operation to the conductor's
RPC API and replicates the older interfaces in the public API. Further,
the first now takes a list of bdms to be destroyed (unlike the db
operation it mirrors) so that multiple RPC calls can be avoided for
bulk delete operations.

some nasty refactoring in some of compute's helper methods to
pass around instances instead of just uuids so that we can
properly pass the former to the conductor.

This patch moves the uses of the following methods in compute/manager
to the conductor:

 - block_device_mapping_create()
 - block_device_mapping_update()
 - block_device_mapping_update_or_create()

As in the past with adding multiple similar operations to conductor,
only one method is actually added to the manager and RPC API, which
is similar to the update_or_create variant above. The public API for
conductor maintains all three variants and their original calling
conventions.

Fixes bug 1091698.

_disassociate_floating_ip and _associate_floating_ip got an extra
parameter since this change:
https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/b93e851c0d90c17868a0e68a3b54e136bb5cd54d
However, the multi-host codepath was not amended, thus multihost case
is broken since that. This fix adds the extra parameters for those rpc
calls.

The tests for timeutils use some canned datetime values that include
timezones, and override the result of utcnow() with the same. This
is not correct because the real utcnow() returns naive datetime
objects, so tests that assume the contrary are incorrect.

This came about because I was unable to satisfy both the oslo unit
tests and the nova ones with the same code. That happened because
the oslo ones override utcnow() with an invalid result, and the
nova tests use the real one.

There is a nova.virt.VIFDriver class which the hypervisor
VIF drivers inherit from. None of the hypervisor subclasses
pay any attention to the API contract defined to the parent
class. Some of the hypervisors don't bother trying to use
the VIFDriver class at all (hyperv, baremetal).

It is not worth trying to make the hypervisor subclasses
follow the same API contract, since the base parent class
offers no re-usable functionality of its own. The hypervisor
base classs nova.virt.ComputeDriver also has no need for the
VIFDriver API to exist, since its integration point is the
'plug_vifs' method.

As such the nova.virt.VIFDriver class serves no purpose
other than to mislead reviewers into thinking there is a
common API where none actually exists. It should thus be
deleted

As described here:

  http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2013-January/004240.html

keystone tests check out various different versions of keystoneclient
and uses them to run a set of tests against the keystone API.

A recent change to keystoneclient in version 0.2.1 introduced a new
dependency on the requests module which is not currently listed as
a dependency for keystone's tests.

Rather than chasing latest keystoneclient on stable/folsom, let's
just test the 0.2.0 version.

don't want to map failure of those to a NovaException
that indicates an issue with the image as opposed to the

exception thrown by guestfs, so as to avoid masking other issues.

hacky call to inject_data() with no data to inject.

Updates the Nova test runner so that it enables

Fixes a slew of issues in the tests including:
 -adds a whole bunch of missing kwarg's to exception constructors
 -removing an extra print statement in ec2/test_cloud
  (this was causing failures...)
 -removing a duplicate (and misnamed) flavor test case:
    test_remove_tenant_access_with_bad_access
 -removing an odd test case which tested throwing an exception with
  and without kwargs explicitly (the part testing without kwargs was
  removed)
 -explicitly update test/test_misc.py's test_exceptions_raise to disable
  formatting checks for now. This allows it to continue to pass.

This patch adds a message envelope that includes a envelope format
version number.  This message envelope will allow us to embed
additional metadata later on, such as a signature for the message
payload.

Up to this point, we've deferred message serialization as a
responsibility of the messaging library we're using by passing it a
message as Python types and letting it deal with how to pass it over a
network.  This patch adds json serialization in the rpc layer of the
application message payload before passing the message down into the
messaging library.

There are some benefits to be gained by doing a pass at serialization
ourselves.  As an example, we occasionally hit serialization bugs that
only affect some messaging drivers.  The kombu driver has always had a
nice advantage.  It uses anyjson internally for serializing messages,
which we hook into using our jsonutils module.  When there is a problem
serializing, we automatically use to_primitive() to fix it.  This patch
allows all drivers to take advantage of this automatic message fix-up.

This also creates a convenient common hook point for messages coming in
and out of the system, regardless of the driver in use.

While this changes the base format of the messages sent between nodes,
it has been done in a backwards compatible manner.  The new message
format will not be used by default.  The idea is that all nodes will be
upgraded to a version that is capable of receiving the new format
(Grizzly) before switching it on.  We will turn it on post-Grizzly.

Implement blueprint version-rpc-messages.

Changing glance-manage to use argparse sub-parsers does result in an
incompatible change. This no longer works:

  $> glance-manage db_sync --config-file=...

because --config-file is interpreted as an argument to the db_sync
command rather than a global argument. Instead you now have to do:

  $> glance-manage --config-file=... db_sync

The incompatibility is unfortunate, but the new behaviour is pretty
standard.

Implements the provider network extension support. The list of valid network
types has been updated to reflect the types supported by the nvp plugin.
This was necessary otherwise validation would have always failed.
Multiple logical switches might be associated with a quantum network; the
first logical switch will always have the same id as the quantum network.
