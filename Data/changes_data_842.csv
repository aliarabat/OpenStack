When conductor/api_url is not configured in ironic.conf, Ironic queries
keystone for the url. When using Undercloud ssl, this results in
deployments using ssl and IPA is not able to talk to Ironic over ssl

Previously, this was not the case, and it would choose the internal url

somewhere and the tripleo-ci promote jobs using undercloud ssl are now
failing to promote due to this issue.

probably the probe tests will fail after a long time passed for the

The iptables apply logic performs diffs between the rules in the
system and the desired rule state. If the format generated in
Neutron does not match the format of iptables-save, Neutron will
generate unnecessary deletions and adds for rules that it thinks
are different when they are actually the same.

A simple way to detect mismatches is to run the _apply function
twice each time and generate an error if the second one results
in changes since that implies that the rules the first one applied
did not match the format of iptables-save. However, this comes at
a performance cost and doesn't offer benefits to operators.

This patch adds a config option to debug_iptables_rules that
is set to False by default. When set to True it will perform
the secondary check described above.

This enables it for all of the jobs that call the gate_hook.sh
script.

This is only meant to assist catching development errors of
iptables, it SHOULD NOT be turned on by operators.

When the only way to define a Software Config was via a Heat resource, the
input and output configs were validated by the properties of the resource.
However, subsequently a REST API to create Software Configs directly was
added. That means that configs created in this way do not have the contents
of the inputs and outputs sections validated. This change adds validation
to ensure that the configs always follow the correct schema.

Neutron is refactoring a lot of its code. For example, common entities
are being moved to neutron-lib. When code is refactored it is marked
with debtcollector, which issues a deprecation warning. In the next
release the old entity will be removed. Consuming projects (like
tricircle) must update to comply with the new entity before the old
one is removed.

Tricircle maintainers must monitor deprecation warnings and act on them
before the next release.

Many deprecations are triggered early (on imports, for example)
before the warnings are enabled by the WarningsFixture in the
base test class.

To make sure all DeprecationWarning messages are emitted we enable
them via the PYTHONWARNINGS environment variable.

This is an initial change to introduce oslo.privsep.  As an example test
candidate, this change also migrates remotefs from rootwrap to privsep.

Since privsep works around python function calls rather than rootwrap's
command lines, the migration is not a simple substition.  The approach
taken here is that all privileged command lines are built on the
privileged side from meaningful arguments that can be verified
separately.

In addition, it is expected that a paranoid deployment of this change
will run the privileged process as a non-root uid, with CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
This non-root uid will need to be able to write to relevant filesystem
locations (eg: /etc/pstorage/clusters/ if using vzstorage), but it means
zero use of uid=0 or sudo, and file operations can be performed in
natural python rather than execing chown, tee, etc.

This patch changes how Cinder responds to detach calls
for volumes that are attached to multiple VMs on a single host.

When multi-attach is enabled and a single volume is attached to
multiple vms on a single host, we don't want to call the driver's
remove_export as this will most likely remove the target and cause
failures for the remaining attachments.

The current datastore selection method in cinder vmdk driver is: get
all the hosts, then iterate over all the datastores of the hosts, this
needs API calls to get datastores of each host, when an adequate
datastore is selected, the loop and selection process will terminate.
If no datastore meets the requirement, it will iterate over all the
hosts.

So if there are many hosts in the environment, and the top hosts in
the host list don't meet the requirement, openstack will keep
iterating and interactiving with the next host, the result is
openstack interactives too much times with vcenter(api calls).
If the user is going to do an operation, for example: create a volume,
it will be very slow to create a volume, it's an potential
performance problem.

Through investigation, the time cost mainly focuses on datastore
selection phase, so this commit aims to improve the performance
problem during datastore selection.

Up to now only a subset of LVM commands (pvs, vgs, lvs & lvdisplay)
ran with an appropriate LVM_SYSTEM_DIR value set in their environment,
based upon the lvm_conf_file config option.

As a result this meant that the /etc/lvm/lvm.conf file still had to
permit scanning of the devices providing the LVM PVs backing Cinder's
Volume Groups. Which of course means that the host and Cinder LVM
operations were not truly isolated from each other.

This has now been rectified by ensuring that all LVM commands are run
with an appropriate LVM_SYSTEM_DIR environment setting.

All LVM commands are constructed as a cmd list prior to being passed
to the _lvm() method or lvm_cmd() staticmethod.

Updated the etc/cinder/rootwrap.d/volume.filters entries for all the
LVM commands to reflect this; they now use the EnvFilter rather than
CommandFilter. Removed redundant _lvmconf filter entries.

Affected unit tests, such as those for Brick LVM, have been updated
to work with this new model.

Notes with regard to Upgrades:
==============================
There shouldn't be any impact on upgrade as a result of this patch
unless a pre-existing effort has been made to fully isolate the host
LVM environment from the Cinder LVM environment by having the host
/etc/lvm/lvm.conf file ignore the devices that will be backing the
Cinder LVM VGs.

However, given that this patch is intended to fix the issues that
prevented the deployment of a system with true isolation of the
host and Cinder LVM environments, I don't believe there is likely
to be any upgrade impact.

If no lvm_conf_file is specified in cinder.conf then before and
after this change any Cinder LVM commands will have been using the
system default lvm.conf file.

If an lvm_conf_file was previously specified, and it used filtering
to limit the set of devices scanned to only those devices that
Cinder should be targeting, then the effect would have been limited
to the show/display commands, whereas now all Cinder generated
LVM commands will be affected. This shouldn't cause problems since
Cinder LVM commands shouldn't be trying to access other devices on
the system anyway.

Now that we support having multiple c-vol nodes serving the same storage
backend under one ""host"", they no longer clean all resources from that
host on start, only those from their own node.  So we need a way to
trigger the cleanup of the resources that were being processed by a
failed node.

This patch adds a new API endpoint (/workers/cleanup) that will trigger
cleanup for c-vol nodes as microversion 3.3.

The cleanup will be performed by other nodes that share the same host,
so at least one of them must be up to be able to do the cleanup.

Cleanup cannot be triggered during a cloud upgrade, but a restarted node
will still cleanup it's own resources during an upgrade.

If no arguments are provided cleanup will issue a clean message for all
nodes that are down, but we can restrict which nodes we want to be
cleaned using parameters `service_id`, `host`, `binary`, `node_id`,
`disabled`, `name`.

Cleaning specific resources is also possible using `resource_type` and
`resource_id` parameters.

We can even force cleanup on nodes that are up with `is_up`, but that's
not recommended.

API will return a dictionary with 2 lists, one with nodes that have been
issued a cleanup request (`cleaning`) and another list with nodes that
cannot be cleaned right now because there is no alternative node to do
the cleanup in that host (`unavailable`).

Data returned for each node in the lists is the same as the summary list
of nodes: `id`, `name` and `state`.

To be able to support multiple nodes working with the same resources we
have added the workers table to keep track of which node is working with
each specific resource.

This patch makes c-bak service work with this new table by adding
entries on cleanable operations and removing them once these operations
have completed.

Service cleanup on initialization has also been changed to use this new
table so nodes will cleanup only resources from operations they left on
the air and leave any operations that are being processed by other nodes.

Backup nodes have been traditionally tightly coupled to volume nodes,
and though we now have the possibility to scale out backups
independently of volumes we may still force backups only to work if the
backup and volume services are on the same node.

And it's for this case, where we have them in the same node as we used
to, that we need c-bak to also support the workers mechanism, because we
can deploy c-vol in HA A-A fashion together with c-bak.

When working in Active-Active configurations nodes may go down, and we

The number of seconds is defined as a multiple of `service_down_time`

Even if this functionality is disabled by default we can easily enable
it with configuration option `auto_cleanup_enabled` or we can manually
trigger it using new API entry point `/workers/auto_cleanup` with
microversion 3.4.

In the same way that the `/workers/cleanup` does, this new API will
return a dictionary with a list of nodes that are going to be cleaned

there is no other node in the host that can do the cleaning

This command will only work on servers supporting API version 3.3 or
higher.

New command:

cinder work-clean [--name <node-name>] [--host <hostname>]
                  [--binary <binary>] [--service-id <service-id>]
                  [--node-id <hostname>] [--resource-id <resource-id>]
                  [--resource-type <Volume|Snapshot>]
                  [--disabled <True|true|False|false>] [--exclude-down]
                  [--include-up]

Volumes nodes will perform cleanup on start, but for cases when a node
doesn't come back up or doesn't have a passive node that will replace it
because we are using an Active/Active configuration Cinder has an auto
cleanup mechanism.

We can auto trigger this auto cleanup mechanism even when it is
disabled.

This patch adds the 'work-autoclean' command to trigger the auto cleanup
on the cloud.

During volume migration, if the driver can provide the direct
path for the source volume directly, there is no need to get
it via attaching the source volume.

This patch adds the implementation of the method
get_direct_volume_path to provide
the path, which can be used to access the volume data directly.
If this method returns None, there is no direct path available.
Otherwise, the path it returns can be used to access the volume
to copy the data. This patch takes LVM as the reference
implementation.

We should also update volume's mutiattach attribute when creating
from snapshot, source volume, or source replica. Currently the
created volume always set multiattach to False, even the source
snapshot/volume/replica/ is allowing multiattach.

This patch adds code to inherit multiattach from the source where
volume is created. The code is added in API layer so that I can
distinguish whether user has explicitly specified a multiattach
attribute. I didn't change API v1, because I think new feature
should only be added to newer version of APIs. I didn't see code to
create volume from source CG, so there is no multiattach inheriting
for that yet (If someone points that out I'm glad to change).

A new API microversion, 3.2, is also added.

The SolidFire config ref was updated to include the requirement
of specifying sf_svip in the config file when using vlans,
however the update doesn't mention the fact that when specifying
this option the admin MUST also include the port number in the ip.

So rather than just ""10.5.3.4"" it must be of the form ""10.5.3.4:3260"".

The mitaka release (forward) will automatically append a default
port number in the driver, but that's not available in Liberty.

This patch just updates the Liberty docs to point out that port
number is required in the argument.

uses the framework from base_resource_filter and base_scheduler, it
is possible to make l3 agent scheduler use one of multiple options to
count its weight. The LeastRoutersScheduler and AZLeastRoutersScheduler
can use this option.

Depending on the current report from l3 agent, the options of
'l3_load_type' could be 'routers', 'interfaces', 'floating_ips', or
'ex_gw_ports'. The default value will be 'routers', which is for backward

Networking-OVN use manager_option configuation for NB and SB

NB and SB dbs are handled by separate ovsdb-server processes. The
ovsdb-server proess manage dbs based on the schemas for OVN NorthBound
and SouthBound. These schemas do not have any Manager Options similar
to the Open_vSwitch schema. As a result, for e.g., the frequency of
inactivity probes sent to clients from the ovsdb-server cannot be
modified.

This patch addresses the above problem by creating independent
 ""conf.db""s for NB and SB. The ovsdb-server process which handles
the NB will handle a NB_conf.db as well, ditto for the ovsdb-server
that handles the SB.

Similar result can be obtained by adding a Manager Table to the
NorthBound and SouthBound DBs as well. In such case there would
not be a need for a separate ""config"" database. I'm willing to
consider this solution as well pending feedback.

Sample Calls for modifying the inactivity probe timeout value:

ovs-appctl -t /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/ovnnb_db.ctl vlog/set any:any:dbg
ovs-appctl -t /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/ovnnb_db.ctl ovsdb-server/list-remotes

If enable isolated metadata for network, a metadata proxy will be
spawned for network with isolated subnets. After the network becomes
non-isolated, metadata proxy from router will provide connection to
metadata service, and metadata proxy for network will be useless.

The process will do no harm, but will have a load issue in large scale
env. Because every network is born to be isolated, every network will
have its own metadata proxy. After lots of networks connecting to
router, there might be many useless metadata proxy from networks, which
will cost the load of host.

This patch will spawn/kill network metadata proxy process, when router
interface create/udpate/delete. So the network metadata proxy will be
spawned/killed, when the network switch between isolated/non-isolated.

This is part of work of refactoring l3 agent scheduler. Since l3
and dhcp scheduler are using the same framework. It is possible
to unify AZAwareWeightScheduler in dhcp agent scheduler and
AZLeastRoutersScheduler in l3 agent scheduler.

This patch will move the logic of AZ scheduling to base_scheduler,
hopefully, other schedulers can leverage the new
BaseAZWeightScheduler to implement their own AZ scheduling.

 This patch documents the two approaches that can be
 considered to support the common flow classifier functionality.
 Multiple Neutron Stadium features need flow classifier functionality.
 Instead of each feature creating its own FC API, we should have one
 common FC API that can be used by all the features. Currently
 the features that need FC are: Tap as a service, SFC, QoS, FW, BGP/VPN.
 Common FC APIs should be a superset of FC rules used by existing features.
 The goal is to come up with one consistent way of defining the API and
 classification rules. Through this common FC API, each Neutron feature
 can define its own FC and then associate the FC instance with the feature itself.

 An approach will be chosen based on design comprehensiveness, usage simplicity,
 future extensions, implementation, upgrade, and performance complexities.

 More patches may follow up on design internals for the
 adopted implementation approach.

Currently, in both unscoped and scoped federated tokens, the
username value in the token is equal to the userid and not to
the value of the username in the external identity provider.
This makes WebSSO login to show the userid of the logged-in
user in the Horizon dashboard, whereas before it was showing
the actual user name.

This patch fixes the value of the username in the federated
tokens, which will fix the WebSSO issue as well, since Horizon
looks at the username value and displays that as the logged-in user.

The related_href was used to parse out the bridge_mappings table.
Unfortunately, *how* you queried for the data identified what the URI
would be.  An earlier change to remove some host_uuid's ended up
malforming the URI and breaking the bridge_mapping logic.

This change fixes how we look at the URIs to see if a SEA is on a given

Apparently that's a thing that people want? At any rate, 30+ projects
have this bug marked ""Fix Released"". However, without a check to keep
them from regressing, there is a long tail of follow-up patches that
distracts developers and reviewers from addressing user-facing bugs. See
the following Nova changes, spread out over the course of a year, for an
example:

The way from_dict is structured today means that it is virtually
impossible for a subclass to use it. The function looks only at its own
__init__ variables and then creates a class with them. If a subclass is
adding something to to_dict (they almost all do) then there is no way
for that subclass to add anything to the from_dict so that it is
correctly reconstructed.

This problem is solvable by the pattern of passing keyword args through
to the constructor and having from_dict add to these arguments if they
are not already present. This pattern is already used by from_environ.

This change also moves from an inspecting __init__ args to explicitly
specifying the arguments supported by from_dict. This will be required
to start doing debtcollector and parameter cleanup without breaking
compatibility in the subclasses where the values returned by inspect may
not be those we actually want to pass to __init__.

Validations can be triggered either manually by user or by dispatching
the RunValidation action. GUI is notified about validation progress
via Zaqar messages. The status of the validation is determined either
by validation output (when listing validations) or by Zaqar message
payload. format of both is equal, which makes use of those sources
simpler.

Currently when a container cache is built, the lxc-create action is
forced to make use of the existing template cache, regardless of
the image age.

Once the cache is prepped, our cache replaces the upstream
downloaded template.

While this is good for the general container creation process, it
is important that when the cache is prepped it is using a fresh
upstream base. This prevents the collection of cruft, ensures that
packages implemented are up to date and that the image contains
what is expected.

Currently the cache prep ends up re-using the previously prepped
cache.

This patch ensures that a fresh upstream image is downloaded if
the existing cache has aged enough based on LXC's default
algorithm.

A plug of a VIF does two operations.  It creates the client side
adapter.  But it also does a 'treat' of the VIF so that the neutron
agent is aware of it.

It is expected that when the nova compute boots up that all of the VIFs
get plugged.  Specifically so that they can be retreated.

As a performance optimization, the PowerVM driver did not run the
plug_vifs if we detected that the client network adapter was already
there.  However, this led to an issue.  The VIF wasn't being
re-'treated' on the nova compute boot.

This wasn't an issue, unless you had the I/O running through the VM that
the nova-compute was running on (like OVS or Linux Bridge).  If that
VM were to be rebooted, then the elements on the trunk adapter (like the
OVS UUID) are lost.  They do not persist via reboot.

This is the OpenStack design and specifically why OpenStack calls
plug_vifs on each compute node reboot.  This change brings the
nova-powervm driver in line with that behavior.

The biggest change is that the OVS will now set the UUID on the trunk
port and therefore the OVS neutron agent will finish its initialization.

To fix bug #1582893 we have removed admin_token_auth middleware
from public/admin/v3 pipelines. It turns out that this change made
it impossible to use dockerctl check command in swarm tests, since
openstack util were unable to authorize itself using admin_token.

I have modified keystone-only.pp to temporary add admin_token_auth
middleware during puppet execution.

This patch moves the module into the canonical place. It does it in
backwards compatible way, by leaving the model available under the old
location, only emitting a deprecation warning on access from there. In
the future, the old module will be completely cleaned up.

This patch also makes head.py file that is used to import and register
all models in the tree to import everything from under neutron.db.models
without explicitly naming each module. In that way, we can avoid the
need to import each new module with models as long as it's located in
the designated place. The file is a well known abuser in terms of git
conflicts, and it's better to avoid manual work.

This patch allows to download from official jessie-backports instead
of building packages. It also allows to add parameters to the ./bb
build backport package shell script in the sid-list file directly.

To test it, we're adding a download of pyopenssl, using:
pyopenssl --download-from-jessie-backports
in the sid-list file.

The current code assumes that there is only one node per compute host,
and thus will try to create mappings for the same host if that host
has multiple nodes (i.e. in ironic).

Change to a set so we do it only once per host.

If a network has been configured as the ""default_interface"" in a

nics argument in create_server. If a nics or a network argument are
given to create_server, that should, of course, win.

Configuration indicating that a network is external only needs to
validate in one direction. Namely, if you indicate that network a is
external, and there exists a network be that can also be inferred to be
external, that's fine. But if you indicate network a is external and we
do not find network a, that's a problem.

The previous test using list length was woefully inadequate for this
purpose.

be cared about - does the server have an ip that would be considered the

There are currently two caches, the global cache, and the per-resource
batch operation caches. The global cache is managed by dogpile. The
per-resource caches are managed by hand. However, dogpile has a mode of
operation that is precisely what we do in our batched operation
per-resource caches by hand. So set ourselves up to have and use
per-resource caches.

Step one is to make the decorator accept an argument that it'll use to
look up the cache.

This change has been inspired while writing release notes here
If0b8b731c2a1a1c41fc612d506c350073d832efa . It was observed that the
bugs mentioned missing config opts in the sample files and have been
marked fixed. However, in order to make the release notes consistent
with that claim and to mention, as a part of the release notes, that
those bugs have been fixed, refreshing this has become important.

IPv6 privacy extensions can cause issues by preferring a temporary
network over a public one. This preference may limit connectivity
in certain situations. An example of a connectivity issue can be
seen where the command ``traceroute6`` fails or misses all hops
while other traffic to a given domain with a ""AAAA"" record may
succeed. To resolve this issue the IPv6 privacy extensions have
been disabled.

Cherry-pick 9e8834489e6caec1b7e640ae56d2fbf4bf2e3775 from master

Currently autoheal functionality is a subset of OCF script
functionality (autoheal is concerned only with network partitions, OCF
also handles all sort of cases where rabbitmq becomes stuck). But as
both of this functions cause stopping and starting of rabbits, it
results in unwanted interference - as we've observed in 1585128, where
it triggered bug in autoheal code.

Even if rabbitmq bug will be fixed, it makes no sense to use both
autoheal and OCF script (actually, when clustered rabbit will stop
getting stuck during network split, autoheal will be as good as OCF
script).

The version class allows us to parse, and compare, API version strings
as per the OpenStack API WG Microversion Specification. Several formats
are supported:

In current code files, the exception handle of deleting vnf
in functional tests like this:

 # Delete vnf_instance with vnf_id
        try:
            self.client.delete_vnf(vnf_id)
        except Exception:
            assert False, ""vnf Delete of test_vnf_with_multiple_vdus failed""
This case just judge the failure of deleting vnf. But if it
didn't delete vnf, there is no possibility of falilure. So this code:

        except Exception:
            assert False, ""vnf Delete of test_vnf_with_multiple_vdus failed""

will be skipped. But acctually, most cases we just think about
delete vnfd successfully. This judgement is wrong.
So add a exception handle like this:

 # Delete vnf_instance with vnf_id
        try:
            self.client.delete_vnf(vnf_id)
        except Exception:
            assert False, ""vnf Delete of test_vnf_with_multiple_vdus failed""
        try:
            vnf_d = self.client.show_vnf(vnf_id)
        except Exception:
            assert True, ""Vnf Delete success"" + str(vnf_d) + str(Exception)

Use show_vnf(vnf_id) again, which make sure the success of deleting vnf.

Protection plugin now needs to implement the set_activities()
method, which will be called with an Activity object. It is the
protection plugin's reponsibility to set activities for each
operation (protect, delete, restore).

Activity can be any callable. In case the activity returns a
generator, it is iterated until completion. The iteration interval
is defined in configuration. The last yielded value is taken as the
activity result.

Main activity is called after worker activities and dependent
resource's main activities are complete.
Worker activities are called independently of other activities
status.

Because option groups can be specified as either bare strings or
OptGroup objects, it is possible to end up with duplicate sections
in the resulting output file.  This is confusing, and can cause
problems for config management systems so we should avoid doing it.

This change avoids the dupes by always keying the group list on
the group name, but including the OptGroup object in the data
when available so the output code can make use of the extra
information in an OptGroup.

This adds the 2.37 microversion to the REST API for automatically
allocating a network, i.e. get me a network.

The majority of the changes to the REST API concern request
validation. 'networks' is now required in the server POST body
after this microversion. The 'auto' or 'none' special network
uuid values are used, but if specified, can not be specified
with any other requested network values.

The other special case that is checked is when the minimum
compute service version is not new enough to support this change,
i.e. a Mitaka compute will not have the network API code that
knows how to deal with the special auto/none network IDs. Because
the REST API is checking the service version, the service caches
the service version after the first check. Once all computes are
updated to Newton then a restart of the nova-api service(s) will
be required to flush the cache. A release note is provided for
this situation.

The api-ref docs are also updated for this microversion including
an example API sample request.
