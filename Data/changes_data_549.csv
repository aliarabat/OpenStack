In Py2, a file object write method returns NoneType.

In Py3, a file object write method returns a count of
bytes written, which can be used to interpret success.

As this code, at least for now, still needs to work
on Py2 without raising what appears to be errors, we
need to remove the assumption that data is returned
upon write.

Should a write fail, IOError is still raised in Py2,
which means the existing exception handling should be
sufficent.

Also, added an explicit flush for before we release the file
lock, just to ensure that the data is actually written out of
python's buffers before the lock is released.

Previously, when calling StackResource._validate_nested_resources() (which
we do whenever we create or update a nested stack), we would load the
nested stack into memory to validate the number of resources in the nested
stack, unless the max_resources_per_stack config option was set to -1. This
meant we would load the nested stack into memory in the same engine as the
parent on every update.

To reduce the memory high-water mark, fetch the information we need over
RPC from another engine instead.

To ensure this is only called once, move the call into the validate code.

The Py2 version of the csv module cannot accept unicode text. In Py2
we replaced the csv module with the unicodecsv module which encodes
unicode text prior to calling the standard Py2 csv module. Thus when
the cvs formatted output is emitted on stdout it is presented as a
encoded byte stream. But stdout has been replaced with a StreamWriter
which encodes to the desired encoding. The problem is the StreamWriter
attempts to encode all objects passed to it's write function,
including str objects. Instead it should only encode unicode text objects
and allow bytes to pass through unmodified.

This patch adds an override of the codecs.getwriter function which
only encodes unicode text objects. In addtion we pass the encoding
value obtained from the stream to the unicodecsv writer.

The patch fixes the codec error when outputing csv formated text that
contains a non-ASCII character. The unicodecsv implmentation will emit
byte encoded str objects to the stream. When the core StreamWriter
attempts to encode a str object Python will first promote the str
object to a unicode object. The promotion of str to unicode requires
the str bytes to be decoded. However the encoding associated with the
str object is not known therefore Python applies the default-encoding
which is ASCII. In the case where the str object contains utf-8
encoded non-ASCII characters a decoding error is raised. By not
attempting to encode a byte stream we avoid this error.

A more complete discussion of the above issues can be found here:

There are some configuration applies that we need to do during the
deployment. These currently live as manually constructed bash runs which
are missing the --detailed-exitcode handling to know when we have
failures.  In order to reduce the duplicated code and simplify this
exeuction, this change creates a docker_config_scripts with
docker_puppet_run.sh in containers-common that can be reused by any of
the docker services. This allows use to properly handle
--detailed-exitcodes while also reducing the amount of duplicated code
bits that we have within THT.

Additionally this change adds a new shared value for ContainersCommon to
pull the required volumes for the docker_puppet_apply.sh script into a
single place. Unfortunately the existing volumes from ContainersCommon
includes a mount for /etc/puppet to /etc/puppet which causes problems
because we need to be able to write out a hiera value.  The /etc/puppet
mount is needed for the bootstrap_host_exec function which is consumed
by various docker_config tasks but the mount conflicts with the puppet
apply logic being used.

This is most likely the GA version of os-traits for the queens

There are only 3 changes in this release. The minor version is
bumped because there are new minimum required package dependencies
in this release.

The release notes URL for the pike deliverable is also updated.

for each RBAC test.

  * Implementation of RbacUtilsMixin
  * Associated unit tests
  * Refactor base RBAC classes to use the mixin

This patch addresses the scalability limitations by removing all class

By design, nova.compute.provider_tree._Provider is intended to be
accessed only through ProviderTree interfaces to ensure thread safety.
However, certain ProviderTree methods were returning _Provider objects,
allowing callers to think it was okay to access their internals
directly.

With this change, we truly hide _Provider behind ProviderTree.  As long
as callers are well-behaved (accessing only public methods of public
classes), there is no longer any way to access _Provider internals.

Summary of the changes:

- ProviderTree.find is removed.
- ProviderTree.new_root and .new_child now return the UUID of the
  newly-created _Provider, rather than the _Provider itself.  (We return
  the UUID because it may have been generated; and there is currently no
  other way for the caller to discover it.)

Note: It is possible that future changes will be necessary to provide
(read-only) access to some _Provider attributes.  No such accessors are
implemented herein.

There is an existing kernel race that prevents libvirt to be notified when
a new mediated device is created thru sysfs. As a result, it is impossible for
Nova to dynamically create those mdevs upon request.
The proposed workaround is to allow a flag to prevent the mdev creation and
rather just use a pool of pre-created mdevs (by the operator) as the only
resource for finding which one to allocate to an instance.

Note that the inventory isn't impacted since the operator should create all the
possible mdevs from a single capable physical device hence that device having
an 'availableInstances' value equal to 0.

 - Unit tests.
 - Proof test on my box.

Since mediated devices are not persisted upon reboot with libvirt, we need a
way to consider non-dynamically generated UUIDs and rather use hashed UUIDs so
when we restart nova-compute, it can pass the same UUID for creating it again.

Fortunately, RFC4122 proposes 2 versions for our purpose: v3 and v5.
Let's take v3 (MD5 hash) and use it by generating an UUID based on the existing
instance UUID and the current index of the number of mediated devices we want
to create.

For example, say instance A uses 2 mediated devices in its guest configuration.
Instead of looking up the guest XML (which can be wrong in case of a hard
reboot for example), we can recreate the mediated devices by having the same
UUIDs.

This change moves most of the common code for prepare, deploy,
tear_down and clean_up methods of agent and iscsi deploy
interfaces into the deploy_utils module.

Apart from that, iscsi deploy interface was triggering
boot.prepare_instance for nodes in ADOPTING state in the prepare method,
which in turn sets boot device. It should not be the case, as BMC of
ADOPTING nodes should not be accessed. Other things, like pxe config
switching, are necessary tho. On the other hand, agent deploy interface
was not calling boot.prepare_instance in prepare method for ADOPTING
nodes, so pxe configs did not get generated, but they should be, in case
of iscsi or netboot. This patch also fixes these inconsistencies.

Legacy jobs in the check and gate queues are being moved to the Neutron
repo in [1]. As a consequence, this change removes most of the Neutron
legacy jobs definition in this repo.

This is a follow up patch to 530258 which will show
extra infromation on empty rings.

This patch goes one step further. On a completely empty ring:

  Devices:   id region zone ip address:port replication ip:port  name weight partitions balance flags meta
  There are no devices in this ring, or all devices have been deleted

It will still start the device list and then say no devices.. Why. let's
see what happens now on an empty ring with devices still marked as
deleted:

  $ swift-ring-builder my.builder add r1z1-127.0.0.1:6010/sdb1 1

  There are no devices in this ring, or all devices have been deleted

Now even when all devices are removed we can still see them as they are still there, only marked as deleted.

The port is firewalled off by default so mysql is not reachable except
to localhost users. In any case it is good to set a password for the
mysql root user.

We are 'reusing' the user_db_password parameter, because it is actually
unused, instead of adding yet another parameter.

Tested this change against an existing undercloud and observed that
the mysql root user got a correct password and that the /root/.my.cnf
file got generated.

This patch is introducing the maintenance mechanism for the database
consistency work.

This new mechanism is based on the futurist library [0].

The ``check_for_incosistencies`` task will compare the
""ovn_revision_numbers"" table with the Neutron's ""standardattributes"" table
and check if there's any difference between the revision numbers. If
some inconsistency is found, the resource will be sync'd with the
latest version in neutron. A OVSDB lock is used for this task as well
to guarantee that only one check is running in the entirely cluster.

The maintenance mechanism runs on its own OVN worker [1] so the OVSDB
lock doesn't conflict with the OVSDB monitor one.

Currently in this patch, only the ``network`` resource is being
addressed to keep it small and easy to review. New resources will be
added on subsequently patches.

To cut down on unnecessary RPC calls, check the template first locally to

There is no need to create set of similar exceptions for every
record that we have in our database it actually makes life harder:

1) More code
2) More exceptions
3) More places to make mistake
4) Every time question to reuse exceptions or create new one
5) Handling of DB related exceptions becomes very hard

As well having single tree of exception related to DB makes handling easier:

- DBException (if you want to handle everything related to DB layer)
-- DBConlfict (conflicts with statuses)

* use the openstack-heat-agents package to install all of the
  python-heat-agent packages, instead of having to specify
  each individually

This reverts commit ab89c7d69c6bba6a6e394ff7a4ae520268bb2b16.

This commit checked for DIB_PYTHON_VERSION and only installed the v3
packages.  This is unfortunately backwards-incompatible, as consumers
such as the openstack gate are relying on this package installing pip
& virtualenv packages for python2 AND python3.

This was sort-of expressed in the docs, where it discusses what the
resulting setup of the system will be, but I've added a note to make
it clearer.

If we want to change this, I think we'll need either a new element, or
a non-defaulting flag.

This commit adds a new kwarg to the process_utils.execute() function to
specify the python executable to use when launching python to check
prlimits. This is necessary when processutils.execute() is called from
inside an API server running with uwsgi. In this case sys.executable is
uwsgi (because uwsgi links libpython.so and is actually the interpreter)
This doesn't work with the execute() function because it assumes the
cpython interpreter CLI is used for the arguments it uses to call the
prlimits module. To workaround this and enable API servers that may run
under uwsgi to use this those applications can simply pass in an
executable to use.

Longer term it might be better to migrate the prlimits usage to call
multiprocessing instead of subprocessing python. But that would require
a more significant rewrite of both processutils and prlimit to
facilitate that.

There is discussion on the mailing list about ceilometerclient removal.

This is a patch to remove the metric service. It's here to be a place
where we can discuss and decide which direction we'd like to go.

On the one hand, it's a REST API so there is no need for us to not
support it. As a general rule removing support for services that we have
is a bad thing.

On the other hand, we haven't cut the 1.0 yet, and as ceilometer doesn't
exist anymore we can't really do devstack testing of it. It's already
special-cased in the Connection constructor because it doesn't exist in
the service types authority, so if there was ever a time to get rid of
it, that time is now.

On the third hand, at least heat, aodh, rally and mistral are using
ceilometer client in some manner, so keeping it here could provide an
option for them if they wanted to keep ceilometer support for some
reason.

VNIC type needs to be specified when creating a server with an SR-IOV
port. In this case, a user first creates a port with vnic_type=direct
and creates a server with the created port. To allow this scenario,
horizon needs to allow users to specify VNIC type for port.

This commit also clean up the code duplication on the port security and

shade has a function called iterate_timeout which is used to, you
guessed it, iterate until a timeout is met. Update wait_for_status and
wait_for_deleted to use iterate_timeout.

While doing that, shift iterate_timeout to be in openstack.utils.

An attempt was made at shifting the parameter names of wait_for_ and
iterate_timeout to align, but aligning in both directions reads wrong.
wait_for_server with wait and interval reads well. iterate_timeout with
timeout and wait reads well. I think consistency is just going to have
to take a back seat to flow on this one.

In cases where a user already has a Session that they're happy with,
making a Connection to wrap it should be quite easy. The only settings
that are needed are Adapter level settings, and all of those have sane
defaults and don't actually need to be set.

Add a factory function that can be used in those cases.

Also, while we're in there, make CloudRegion use the word ""region_name""
like everyone else.

This removes the get_region_name method that we added originally to occ in an
early attempt to support openstacksdk. However, nothing in the data
model makes sense if one service has one region_name and another service
has another region_name. Connection is a connection to a region of a
cloud.

Previously when a user accesses the network topology panel

This requires one API call to nova per VM, and this causes

Actually there is no need to resolves VM console URL when

VM can be resolved when a user actually accesses a console.

This patch adds a new status module which defines statuses of a lease,

these statuses.

The LeaseStatus class provides a lease_status method which is used as a
decorator for the *-lease method of the ManagerService class.
A status of a lease is checked and updated before/after executing
*-lease methods by decorating these methods. This patch decorates some
*-lease methods with it.

This patch also replaces status literals with members of the *Status
classes, e.g. the 'pending' literal is replaced by
ReservationStatus.PENDING.

On Dell Force10 switches, if an interface is left untagged in another
VLAN, networking-generic-switch will silently fail to plug the port to
the network. Only when Neutron is in debug mode, the following line is
displayed as part of the Netmiko session:

    % Error: <interface> Port is untagged in another Vlan.

With this patch, the Dell Force10 device driver detects the error
returned by the switch command and raises a new exception:
GenericSwitchPlugPortToNetworkError.

While this is not a fatal error since Neutron retries the bind_port
operation 10 times before continuing, it ensures that the problem is
logged at ERROR level, and thus may be better noticed by operators.

On hosts that do not have any containers (ie. computes) network bridges
are not needed and may introduce some unwanted overhead. This
configuration was possible until Mitaka, but broke with the
dynamic-address-fact.yml tasks in Newton.

This change checks if the bridge actually exists and otherwise uses the
IP configured in the inventory instead.

The name CloudConfig has always sucked. While working on the next patch,
it occurred to me that what a CloudConfig represents is the config for a
given region of a cloud. We even reference ""Cloud Region"" as a unit of
work when giving conference talks.

Take the opportunity while we're doing this sdk/occ merge to rename it.
Obviously we can provide naming compat shim in OCC itself.

Leave in *some* naming compat shims to get us past the 0.10 release so
that OSC continues to have the happies.

This is required for nova to see new ironic nodes. Currently, we run
'nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts' in tripleo-common, but it only
affects nodes enrolled via our workflows. Nodes enrolled via auto-discovery
are not affected by it, and it may be impossible to deploy on them.
The same applies to node enrolled via ironic CLI directly.

The periodic task is already enabled by default for ironic in the overcloud
with a period of 15 seconds. This patch enables the same in the undercloud.

After this change lands, calling nova-manage from mistral won't be

A few changes on the HEAT templates plus some new fragments now
allow, by default, to have monitoring enabled in Swarm clusters
running with Docker v1.10.

The templates will install a cadvisor and node-exporter container on
each node and master. As an ExecStartPost, the cadvisor service on the
nodes will launch a script to deploy (if absent) a Prometheus
container and a Grafana container with affinity to Prometheus.  An
auxiliary container will be launched to do the node discovery in the
cluster and update the Prometheus configuration (the cluster master
nodes are not yet included in Prometheus config - TBD).

In the end, a Grafana UI will be available with the default login
admin:admin. The user has to inject the Prometheus datasource running
in the same node in port 9090.

The respective API modifications, fine tuning, adding TLS to
monitoring containers and adding compliance with Docker v1.12 are
improvements in progress, to be added in future reviews.

Added in change I2bbdac5cd431e72517cb1c72bb925660ec8e868b,
ironic needed to run the multi-node jobs in singleconductor
mode because they rely on reschedules working in nova, which
doesn't work in superconductor mode where the top-level conductor
and scheduler are on a different message queue from the compute
service and cell conductor.

With the alternate hosts series in nova in Queens, we should have
the reschedule problem fixed such that when originally scheduling,
we not only get a target host but also a list of alternates for
retries within the cell. This allows us to run ironic multi-node
CI jobs (and all ironic non-upgrade related jobs for that matter)
in the default superconductor mode which is the recommended way
to run nova with cellsv2.

According to Open vSwitch FAQ [1], max-rate value which is set for
all queues in qos is set as link speed in case when it is not specified.
This can lead to inaccurate ingress bandwidth limits in case when QoS is
applied e.g. directly on tapXXX port (which is ""tun"" interface type) and
configured bandwidth limit is higher than interface's link_speed.
This patch set max-rate parameter in qos's other_config table to not use
default value determined by Open vSwitch and to make rate limits more
accurate.

The modification is covered by functional tests in
https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/neutron/tests/
functional/agent/test_ovs_lib.py.

_get_host_states returns a generator which closes over seen_nodes, which
is local, and self.host_state_map, which is global. It also modifies
self.host_state_map, and will remove entries whose compute nodes are no
longer present.

If a compute node is deleted while a filter is still evaluating the
generator returned by _get_host_states, the entry in self.host_state_map
will be deleted if _get_host_states is called again. This will cause a
KeyError when the first generator comes to evaluate the entry for the
deleted compute node.

We fix this by modifying the returned generator expression to check
that a host_state_map entry still exists before returning it. An
existing unit test is modified to exhibit the bug.

This addresses a review comment from change
I8666e0af3f057314f6b06939a108411b8a88d64b for some
missing tests. This code is tightly coupled between
how the SchedulerManager calls FilterScheduler.select_destinations
and how the provider_summaries variable is interpreted differently
when it's None or {}, and is also tightly coupled to how
HostManager._get_computes_for_cells considers compute_uuids being
None or not when grabbing all compute nodes from a cell. Because
of this coupling and complexity, the NOTE in the method is also
updated for clarity.

The Cinder 3.48 API provides a shared_targets and service_uuid
field in the volume resource which tells the caller whether or
not it should lock operations on that volume.

This change adds that logic to the DriverVolumeBlockDevice attach
and detach flows by first trying to get the volume at the 3.48
microversion and if that's not available, it simply falls back
to get the volume the same as before.

If 3.48 is available and the volume storage backend uses shared
targets, we synchronize the attach/detach operations using the
volume service_uuid, which is based on the storage backend and
is also configurable by the deployer on the Cinder side.

This is a nice to have protection for ""normal"" volumes but
is really needed for multiattach volumes to be detached safely.

See Cinder blueprint add-shared-targets-flag-to-volume for details.

Nova is assuming 'host-model' for KVM/QEMU setup.

On AArch64 it results in ""libvirtError: unsupported configuration: CPU
mode 'host-model' for aarch64 kvm domain on aarch64 host is not
supported by hypervisor"" message.

AArch64 lacks 'host-model' support because neither libvirt nor QEMU
are able to tell what the host CPU model exactly is. And there is no
CPU description code for ARM(64) at this point.

So instead we fallback to 'host-passthrough' to get VM instances
running. This will completely break live migration, *unless* all the
Compute nodes (running libvirtd) have *identical* CPUs.

These files are quite large and disk space is limited so make sure we
compress the log files before copying them to storage. Additionally
os-loganalyze will only operate on gzipped log files so this should fix
os-loganalyze with tempest-full job's logs.

This is mostly a check to confirm everything works as expected but we
probably want to move the gzip step into the log publication roles so
that all log files end up compressed.
