Nowadays, Technical Writing SIG is lacking maintainer and the
current Chair Stephen Finucane would not be able to continue
leading this SIG.

In TC weekly meetings and PTG[1], we decided to merge this
SIG responsibility in TC and a few repos which are related
to upstream institute training will be moved to First Contact
SIG.

One repo 'training-labs' is left for now, which will be called
for the maintainer, and if there is no one, we can retire it.
We are not even sure who is using it. Upstream training and CoA
do not use this repo.

With PKI role in place in most cases you don't need to explicitly
provide path to the CA file because PKI role ensures that CA is trusted
by the system overall. In the meanwhile in PyMySQL [1] you must either
provide CA file or cert/key or enable verify.

Since current behaviour is to provide path to the custom CA we expect
certificate being trusted overall. Thus we enable cert verification when
galera_use_ssl is True.

returning a 404.

This should not clobber up the logs much more, due to the fact
that if you are sending a request to the metadata service, you're
supposed to already exist, so not being able to find the metadata
for an instance seems like a broken case.

This patch should help operators at least uncover why exactly
their instances are failing to get the metadata to further
troubleshoot.

It appears that the generated description of oooq feature sets
was not updated in some time. This isn't an issue as long as the documentation
is build before publishing, as this regenerates the matrix.

However the version of the matrix within repository was out of sync
with the version shown in the upstream docs.[0]

Furthermore, patches to the feature sets, or their documentation,
could contain changes to the feature matrix, that were seemingly inconsistent
with the changes to the '*.yml' files.

To remedy these issues, the matrix was regenerated locally and new version
submitted as a patch.

When the swift /info endpoint is queried, Tempest fails checking the
following missing keys:

1. max_meta_count
2. max_meta_name_length
3. max_meta_value_length

Those keys are not present because the related rgw settings are missing,
and as per [1], nothing is generated if the rgw_max_* are not set.
This patch is a workaround, on the TripleO side, to provide the missing
keys to the cluster.

This is follow up of the patch [1] which fixed updating MTU in the
snat namespace for the DVR routers.
In case of DVR-HA routers there was additional issue with that as
L3 agent tried to update MTU for the qr- interface in the
self.ha_namespace which, for DVR-HA routers is snat namespace.

This patch fixes that issue by setting MTU on the qr- interface in
qrouter namespace and also setting MTU on the snat interface in snat
namespace.

We discovered that two unit test cases added in
I0647bb8545c1464b521a1d866cf5ee674aea2eae cause errors like
  oslo_db.sqlalchemy.enginefacade.AlreadyStartedError:
  this TransactionFactory is already started

when the db tests run selectively with tox -e py38 nova.tests.unit.db
but does not cause errors if the whole unit test suit is run.

This error happened because our db code uses two global transaction
factory, one for the api DB and one for the main DB. There was a global
flag SESSION_CONFIGURED in our Database fixture that guarded against
double initialization of the factory. But the faulty test cases in
question do not use our Database fixture but use the
OpportunisticDBTestMixin from oslo_db. Obviously that fixture does not
know about our SESSION_CONFIGURED global. So if one of the offending
test case ran first in an executor then that initialized the
transaction factory globally and a later test that uses our Database
fixture tried to configure it again leading to the error. For some
unknown reason if these tests were run in the opposite order the faulty
re-initialization did not happen. Probably the OpportunisticDBTestMixin
was able to prevent that.

A previous patch already removed the global SESSION_CONFIGURED flag
from our fixture and replaced it with a per DB specific patch_factory
calls that allow resetting the state of the factory at the end of each
test case. This would already solve the current test case issue as only
our offending test cases would initialize the global factory without
cleanup and we have one test case per DB. So there would be no
interference. However if in the future we add similar test cases then
those can still interfere through the global factory.

So this patch fixes the two offending test case. Also it extends the
DatabasePoisonFixture used for the NoDbTestCase tesst. The poison now
detects if the test case starts any transaction factory.

This poison caught another offender test case,
test_db_sync_with_special_symbols_in_connection_string, that was marked
NoDb but actually using the database. It is now changed to declare
itself as a test that sets up the DB manually and also it is changed to
use the Database fixture instead of touching the global factory
directly.

In case of DVR-HA routers there was additional issue with that as
L3 agent tried to update MTU for the qr- interface in the
self.ha_namespace which, for DVR-HA routers is snat namespace.

This patch fixes that issue by setting MTU on the qr- interface in

This is follow up of the patch [1] which fixed updating MTU in the
snat namespace for the DVR routers.
In case of DVR-HA routers there was additional issue with that as
L3 agent tried to update MTU for the qr- interface in the
self.ha_namespace which, for DVR-HA routers is snat namespace.

This patch fixes that issue by setting MTU on the qr- interface in
qrouter namespace and also setting MTU on the snat interface in snat
namespace.

During resize, on the source host, in resize_instance(), the instance.host
and .node is updated to point to the destination host. This indicates to
the source host's resource tracker that the allocation of this instance
does not need to be tracked as an instance but as an outbound migration
instead. However for the source host's resource tracker to do that it,
needs to use the instance.old_flavor. Unfortunately the
instance.old_flavor is only set during finish_resize() on the
destination host. (resize_instance cast to the finish_resize). So it is
possible that a running resize_instance() set the instance.host to point
to the destination and then before the finish_resize could set the
old_flavor an update_available_resources periodic runs on the source
host. This causes that the allocation of this instance is not tracked as
an instance as the instance.host point to the destination but it is not
tracked as a migration either as the instance.old_flavor is not yet set.
So the allocation on the source host is simply dropped by the periodic
job.

When such migration is confirmed the confirm_resize() tries to drop
the same resource allocation again but fails as the pinned CPUs of the
instance already freed.

When such migration is reverted instead, then revert succeeds but the
source host resource allocation will not contain the resource allocation
of the instance until the next update_available_resources periodic runs
and corrects it.

This does not affect resources tracked exclusively in placement (e.g.
VCPU, MEMORY_MB, DISK_GB) but it does affect NUMA related resource that
are still tracked in the resource tracker (e.g. huge pages, pinned
CPUs).

This patch moves the instance.old_flavor setting to the source node to
the same transaction that sets the instance.host to point to the
destination host. Hence solving the race condition.

Setting new controller for bridge every time when neutron-ovs-agent
is restarted or is doing full-sync may cause some short data plane
connectivity loss and is not needed if same controller is already
configured for the bridge.
With this patch neutron-ovs-agent will first check if controller is
configured for the bridge and if it's the same as what should be
configured, it will skip setting it up.

With this patch also protocols added to the bridge will be first checked
if they aren't already there and only missing ones will be added if
necessary.

Setting of the connectivity mode and inactivity probe is
always performed as this don't cause connectivity issues and is cheap
so we can always ensure that those parameters are configured properly.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect

will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/xena branch, tests will
continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

after any errors.

Currently, if the build/run/export steps fail, it leaves behind images
which eventually clog things to the point podman won't run any more

This patch switches using f-strings instead of regular ones in places
where pep8 was complaining about with error C0209. That part is
cherry-picked from commit [1] in master branch.

This patch also removes lower-constraints job as we agreed some time ago
to not run that job in the stable branches.

Finally it also removes functional and tempest jobs which runs OVS and
OVN from master/main branches. We don't need to test that in the stable
release. Those jobs should be run in the master branch and in stable
branches are not needed anymore.

For some crazy reason ``puppet-ironic`` indicates a database
property is optional and by default populates a unsupported sqllite
database file.

While ironic *can* start and maybe partially work with such a backend
data file, the locking which occurs causes blocking access while write
locks are open to the API surface, which is functionally fairly blocking.

As such, the setting is now required.

  - provider_fw_rules

Unfortunately we can't get rid of the security group-related entries due
to the unfortunate presence of the 'security_groups' attribute on the

load of other tables. We'll address that separately. For now, just drop

Finish up removing these entries from the versioned instance
notifications. They're useless since we dropped support for the XenAPI
virt driver. The underlying model is retained for now: that will be
handled separately.

We've built up a large amount of tables that are no longer used for
anything, given the removal of their users in past releases. We'd like
to remove those, but before we do that we need to drop the models. This
means there are no references to the tables come N+2, at which point we
can remove the tables themselves.

XenAPI virt driver
  Feature removed entirely in Victoria.

  - agent_builds
  - bw_usage_cache
  - console_pools
  - consoles

Cells v1
  Feature removed entirely in Train.

  - cells

Volume Snapshots
  Feature removed entirely in Liberty.

  - snapshots

EC2 API
  Feature removed entirely in Mitaka. Note that these tables are *not*
  used by the separate ec2-api project.

  - snapshot_id_mappings
  - volume_id_mappings

There are still some tables related to nova-network left here. Those are
unfortunately referenced from elsewhere, so we need to clean them up
separately.

This patch apply the following changes to the fixture to make the
intention clearer and remove some unnecessary complexity:

* the fixture does a lot of dynamic thing in its __init__, these are
  moved to setUp() instead to facilitate proper reset functionality of
  the fixture

* the caching and applying of the DB schema is made a explicit and
  moved to setUp() too

* the explicit reset() function is removed as it is probably
  unintentionally overwrote the Fixture.reset(). Now the Fixture can be
  properly reset by calling the Fixture.reset() which is by default
  implemented by calling cleanUp() and setUp()

The SESSION_CONFIGURED global flag is used in the Database fixture to
guard against the reconfiguration of the DB context in each test as the
global transaction factory does not allow such reconfiguration. However
this global is error prone for multiple reasons:

 * there are tests that actually configure the factory outside of the
   fixture causing tests to interfere

 * we use one single global flag but we always have two separate
   Database fixture one for the api DB and one for the main DB. Still
   the fixture instantiated first will do the configuration of both

This patch replaces the global with two individual oslo_db enginefacade
patch_factory() calls that allows patching and resetting the global
factory per test case.

This topic was discussed on the ML and QA team proposed to test
lower constraints [1]. As decided in horizon weekly meeting in
the past[2], stable branches will drop the lower-constraints job from CI.

This patch also update ``.zuul.yaml`` to test stable/stein with
tempest 24.0.0 for the below reasons:

For every stable branch, Tempest as a range of versions
to work[3] and we can pick either first supported
or last supported version to test the specific EM stable
branch (when Tempest master is in not used).

For stable/stein, first supported version is Tempest 20.0.0
and last supported verson is 26.0.0.

Till now we used the last supported version and it was working
fine until jsonschema latest release 4.0.0 has some incompatible
changes. Now we can say our upper constraints should protect us
from this (like it protect in Tempest master case). But thing
is little tricky here on whether we use the compatible constraints
with tempest 26.0.0. or not.

Compatible constraints for Tempest 26.0.0 is stable/victoria constraints
(the time tag 26.0.0 was cut) but we used stable/stein constraints with
tempest 26.0.0 in stable/stein[4].

We should always use the compatible constraints and tag combination.

We have two option here to solve:

3. Use Tempest 24.0.0 and compatible stable/stein constraints (this commit)
4. Use Tempest 26.0.0 and compatible stable/victoria constraints

I am going with the 1st approach as it is simple and 2nd approach need
modification in run-tempest roles etc.

Same fix is done at devstack side for stable/stein gate fix

Podman isn't really well-equipped to handle processes that manage their
own cgroups (like libvirtd that manages cgroups for QEMU), as
rhbz#2009106 shows.

We have a systemd-managed podman container ""nova_libvirt"" which hosts
a service in charge of spawning qemu VMs. On first start, the
container's processes are all attached to the same cgroup created by
runc.

└─machine.slice
  ├─libpod-xxx.scope
  │ ├─  2913 dumb-init --single-child -- kolla_start
  │ ├─  2983 /bin/bash /nova_libvirt_launcher.sh
  │ ├─  3213 /usr/sbin/libvirtd --listen

the conmon process that checks the container runs under another cgroup:

├─system.slice
│ ├─tripleo_nova_libvirt.service
│ │ └─2852 /usr/bin/conmon ...... -r /usr/bin/runc ......

Any time the nova_libvirt's service is called, a new daemon process (a
qemu VM) will be started inside that container:

│ └─402633 /usr/libexec/qemu-kvm .......

This process shares the same libpod-xxx cgroup, but also uses other
ones (this is expected libvirt behaviour):

[heat-admin@compute-1 ~]$ cat /proc/402633/cgroup
12:cpuset:/machine/qemu-1-instance-00000003.libvirt-qemu/emulator
11:cpu,cpuacct:/machine/qemu-1-instance-00000003.libvirt-qemu/emulator
10:rdma:/
9:pids:/machine.slice/libpod-xxx.scope
8:freezer:/machine/qemu-1-instance-00000003.libvirt-qemu
7:memory:/machine/qemu-1-instance-00000003.libvirt-qemu
6:devices:/machine/qemu-1-instance-00000003.libvirt-qemu
5:perf_event:/machine/qemu-1-instance-00000003.libvirt-qemu
4:blkio:/machine/qemu-1-instance-00000003.libvirt-qemu
3:hugetlb:/machine.slice/libpod-xxx.scope
2:net_cls,net_prio:/machine/qemu-1-instance-00000003.libvirt-qemu
1:name=systemd:/machine.slice/libpod-xxx.scope

This cgroups placement shows libvirt using the direct cgroups apis and
not sytstemd. This is sufficient to let this process run even after we
stop this container with systemd/podman. Or recreate it with paunch or
container manager, which is essential for non-disruptive minor updates.

This configuration exposes the podman bug rhbz#2009106 that makes it
crash under a specific succession of actions. Within this particular
change scope, when we stop the container, the qemu process remains as
expected, but it also remains attached to the libpod-xxx cgroup, which
is not that we really want.

Name=systemd is a mount point systemd uses for accounting purposes.
It is what systemd uses when it wants to enumerate pids on a cgroup
that it needs to kill, whenever it tears things down. We dont want that
one to have libpod in it. If libvirt does not move qemu out of
the name=systemd mount, and systemd kills the libpid-xxxxxx.scope,
it might kill qemu as well.

Because of that, the (default) control-group KillMode should not be
used. Switch libvirt container to the process KillMode to mitigate
that.

Added a new OVN Client extension: OVNClientPlacementExtension. This
extension is in charge of handling the bandwidth information stored
in the OVN database, in the ""Chassis"" registers on the
""ovn-cms-options"" dictionary.

Three new keys are created to store the resource provider information
needed to parameterize the network backend bandwidth information,
following the implementation done in OVS and SR-IOV:
- resource_provider_bandwidths
- resource_provider_inventory_defaults
- resource_provider_hypervisors

When the OVN Client is started, the Placement extension will check if
the ""placement"" extension is loaded. It will also create an event to
check any configuration change done in any ""Chassis"" register.

The Placement extension will read the initial configuration stored
in the OVN database and will populate it to Placement API, creating
the needed resource providers, traits and inventories.

NOTE: This patch belongs to a series of patches to implement
minimum bandwidth scheduling blueprint in OVN backend. The next
patch will make OVN backend scheduling aware using the information
stored in Placement API and the port information passed by Nova when
a VM is created.

NOTE: this patch improves [1], fixing the error [2] reported in [3].

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/off-path-smartnic-dpu-port-binding-with-ovn

Off-path SmartNIC DPUs introduce an architecture change where network
agents responsible for NIC switch configuration and representor
interface plugging run on a separate SoC with its own CPU, memory and
that runs a separate OS kernel. The side-effect of that is that
hypervisor hostnames no longer match SmartNIC DPU hostnames which are
seen by ovs-vswitchd and OVN agents while the existing port binding
code relies on that. The goal of this specification is to introduce
changes necessary to extend the existing hardware offload code to cope
with the hostname mismatch and related design challenges while reusing
the rest of the code. To do that, PCI(e) add-in card tracking is
introduced for boards with unique serial numbers so that it can be used
to determine the correct hostname of a SmartNIC DPU which is responsible
for a particular VF. Additionally, more information is suggested to be
passed in the ""binding:profile"" during a port update to facilitate
representor port plugging.

Until now, the inventory path used by the overcloud_delete.py was wrong,
since it wasn't using the ""stackname"", leading to a wrong
/home/stack/config-download/{}/tripleo-ansible-inventory.yaml path.

While it's not a big issue with non-TLS-e deploy, it becomes an actual
problem when we involve FreeIPA and TLS-e, since the deletion won't
remove the nodes nor services from FreeIPA.

It turns out that you can't use the devstack post_config phase
for this because it happens too late.  The quota settings must
be made to cinder.conf before cinder-manage db_sync is called
where they're used to set the max limit for the tables used by
the db quotas driver.

Currently with KillMode=none, if podman -t hangs, the command repeats
leaving the process and its cgroup around.
But if a stop/start command hangs, we should not start another one.

Instead time it out properly via TimeoutStopSec set to the 2x of
the timeout given to the managed podman action. Then if it expires,
kill its cgroup all the way (KillMode=control-group is a default)
before rerunning the same operation. Also note that using KilMode
process is not recommended by systemd man pages.

Increase the grace stop timeout defaults 10->42s to align it with:

This is follow up of the patch [1] which fixed updating MTU in the
snat namespace for the DVR routers.
In case of DVR-HA routers there was additional issue with that as
L3 agent tried to update MTU for the qr- interface in the
self.ha_namespace which, for DVR-HA routers is snat namespace.

This patch fixes that issue by setting MTU on the qr- interface in
qrouter namespace and also setting MTU on the snat interface in snat
namespace.

Some firmware seems to take an objection with EFI nvram
entries being deleted after one is added, resulting in the
entire entry table being reset to the last known good state.

This is problematic, as ultimately deployments can time out
if we previously booted with Networking, and the machine, while
commanded to do other wise, reboots back to networking regardless.

We will now delete entries first, before proceeding.

Additionally, for general use, this pattern may serve the
community better by avoiding cases where we would have
previously just relied upon efibootmgr[0] to warn us of duplicate
entries.

This patch removes the client-ceph-config job which was intended to
update the ceph-client-etc configmap with the mon_host IP addresses
so that ceph pods would get the IP address configuration when they
startup. However, the strategy has changed to use a common Helm
toolkit method to do this from the startup script of the Ceph pods
which require to talk to Ceph monitors. So this job is no longer
needed.

The checkDNS deployment, however, is still needed, just in case
one of the Ceph monitor IP addresses change, the other pods will
be updated by the checkDNS pod within 5 minutes.

We discovered that two unit test cases added in
I0647bb8545c1464b521a1d866cf5ee674aea2eae cause errors like
  oslo_db.sqlalchemy.enginefacade.AlreadyStartedError:
  this TransactionFactory is already started

when the db tests run selectively with tox -e py38 nova.tests.unit.db
but does not cause errors if the whole unit test suit is run.

This error happened because our db code uses two global transaction
factory, one for the api DB and one for the main DB. There was a global
flag SESSION_CONFIGURED in our Database fixture that guarded against
double initialization of the factory. But the faulty test cases in
question do not use our Database fixture but use the
OpportunisticDBTestMixin from oslo_db. Obviously that fixture does not
know about our SESSION_CONFIGURED global. So if one of the offending
test case ran first in an executor then that initialized the
transaction factory globally and a later test that uses our Database
fixture tried to configure it again leading to the error. For some
unknown reason if these tests were run in the opposite order the faulty
re-initialization did not happen. Probably the OpportunisticDBTestMixin
was able to prevent that.

A previous patch already removed the global SESSION_CONFIGURED flag
from our fixture and replaced it with a per DB specific patch_factory
calls that allow resetting the state of the factory at the end of each
test case. This would already solve the current test case issue as only
our offending test cases would initialize the global factory without
cleanup and we have one test case per DB. So there would be no
interference. However if in the future we add similar test cases then
those can still interfere through the global factory.

So this patch fixes the two offending test case. Also it extends the
DatabasePoisonFixture used for the NoDbTestCase tesst. The poison now
detects if the test case starts any transaction factory.

This poison caught another offender test case,
test_db_sync_with_special_symbols_in_connection_string, that was marked
NoDb but actually using the database. It is now changed to declare
itself as a test that sets up the DB manually and also it is changed to
use the Database fixture instead of touching the global factory
directly.

This patch apply the following changes to the fixture to make the
intention clearer and remove some unnecessary complexity:

* the fixture does a lot of dynamic thing in its __init__, these are
  moved to setUp() instead to facilitate proper reset functionality of
  the fixture

* the caching and applying of the DB schema is made a explicit and
  moved to setUp() too

* the explicit reset() function is removed as it is probably
  unintentionally overwrote the Fixture.reset(). Now the Fixture can be
  properly reset by calling the Fixture.reset() which is by default
  implemented by calling cleanUp() and setUp()

The SESSION_CONFIGURED global flag is used in the Database fixture to
guard against the reconfiguration of the DB context in each test as the
global transaction factory does not allow such reconfiguration. However
this global is error prone for multiple reasons:

 * there are tests that actually configure the factory outside of the
   fixture causing tests to interfere

 * we use one single global flag but we always have two separate
   Database fixture one for the api DB and one for the main DB. Still
   the fixture instantiated first will do the configuration of both
   DB factory.

This patch replaces the global with two individual oslo_db enginefacade
patch_factory() calls that allows patching and resetting the global
factory per test case.

Create VFs using udev rules are required for attaching
and removing PF from a VM. On a reboot, when udev rules
trigger VF creation script and when a VF is attached to
vfio-pci driver, some of the VFs on that PF are not
initialized properly, resulting in VF not found issue.
Though it looks like driver issue, this patch avoids
this scenarios by removing the nic-paritioned VF from
the udev rule, as when one of the VF is attached to host,
the PF cannot be used by the VM.

The function setUp_pf_stubs() was added in the vdpa patch:

When Nova is asked to create an instance snapshot of an instance booting
from a volume using the imageCreate API it will make a request to Cinder
to snapshot the underlying volume. This request is asynchronus and
returns to Nova before the volume snapshot becomes available.

This can easily race other volume operations if callers did not wait for
the volume snapshot to become `available` and overall state of the
volume to return to `in-use`.

Bug #1908269 outlines an example of this race where
AttachVolumeMultiAttachTest.test_snapshot_volume_backed_multiattach
attempts to delete the overall volume while the earlier request to
snapshot the volume was still in progress leading to a failure.

This change simply introduces the use of the
wait_for_volume_resource_status waiter into the create_image_from_server
utility method when a volume snapshot is identified in the snapshot
image metadata for the instance. This should result in the volume
snapshot reaching `available` and volume returning to `in-use` before
the test attempts to cleanup both the instance and volume.

The DEFAULT_IMAGE_NAME variable is used to reference the name of the
default image in glance after it has been uploaded by devstack. It is
used both inside and outside of devstack for that purpose. However, when
configuring tempest there are some tests which also do image uploads and
need a filename for specifying which file they should upload into glance
for testing purposes. Previously we were just using DEFAULT_IMAGE_NAME
for both purposes, but this causes a conflict if the name of the image
we upload into glance does not have a file extension. So instead of
conflating the things this commit differentiates between them and adds a
new DEFAULT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME variable to use for this purpose.

This conflicts because there were several intermediate changes before
this was finished. This just skips to the end state. Additionally the
change id is removed because to get things working in the gate
consistently this needs to land in a very specific order. This can't be
done if the change-ids all match.

Currently the <service>::wsgi::apache::ssl parameters have inconsistent
default values. Some parameters default to true while the other default
to false.

Based on the following points, false is considered to be the more
reasonable default.
 - Usage of SSL is optional and is not always required
 - There are other methods(like load-balancer) to implement SSL
   termination
 - Enabling SSL doesn't work with the default values currently
   defined, and requires additional parameters like ssl_cert.
 - false is the default value defined in the base implementation in
   puppet-openstacklib.

This change is the preparation to change the default value, and
introduces a warning message to make users aware of the future change.

This patch clears up confusion resulting from both tripleo and
cinder creating ""default"" volume types. The quotes indicate subtle
differences in how the term is used, and how it causes confusion for
cloud users.

TripleO added support for configuring cinder's default volume type,
and later cinder itself added its own support for a default volume
type. The cinder project's motivation was to provide a volume type
for all volumes, even when cloud administrators hadn't defined one.
But from tripleo's perspective, cinder's volume type was redundant
because tripleo *does* define a default volume type.

The confusion for cloud users is that cinder chose ""__DEFAULT__"" for
the name of the volume type, and ""Default Volume Type"" for its
description. This is misleading because tripleo's CinderDefaultVolumeType
is the actual default volume type.

Clearing up the confusion depends on whether the overcloud is a green
field deployment where no volumes have been created, or a brown field
deployment where cinder's __DEFAULT__ type may be in use. If no volumes
exist then it's safe for tripleo to simply delete cinder's __DEFAULT__
type. Otherwise, the __DEFAULT__ type's description is updated so that
it indicates the actual default type is the one established by the
CinderDefaultVolumeType parameter.

Lastly, CinderDefaultVolumeType is now constrained to prevent it being
set to an empty string. That should never happen, so this is just a
safety net.

As set out in the governance repo for Xena CentOS 8 stream with py36 is
a supported platform and runtime for the release:

https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/runtimes/xena.html

As a result the Nova team want to run CentOS 8 stream based jobs within
the integrated-gate-compute template.

An additional tempest-full-py3-centos-8-stream job is added to Tempest's
check and gate queues to ensure coverage here.

Both jobs are given additional swap to workaround bug #1949606, a
behaviour change in QEMU >= 5.0.0 when using [libvirt]virt_type=qemu
that causes additional memory to be consumed by each running instance.

This workaround of additional swap will be removed in the future once
Nova is able to workaround this itself through a new libvirt domain
configurable.

When the nova-compute service starts, by default it attempts to
startup instance configuration states for aspects such as networking.
This is fine in most cases, and makes a lot of sense if the
nova-compute service is just managing virtual machines on a hypervisor.

This is done, one instance at a time.

However, when the compute driver is ironic, the networking is managed
as part of the physical machine lifecycle potentially all the way into
committed switch configurations. As such, there is no need to attempt
to call ``plug_vifs`` on every single instance managed by the
nova-compute process which is backed by Ironic.

Additionally, using ironic tends to manage far more physical machines
per nova-compute service instance then when when operating co-installed
with a hypervisor. Often this means a cluster of a thousand machines,
with three controllers, will see thousands of un-needed API calls upon
service start, which elongates the entire process and negatively
impacts operations.

In essence, nova.virt.ironic's plug_vifs call now does nothing,
and merely issues a debug LOG entry when called.

Setting new controller for bridge every time when neutron-ovs-agent
is restarted or is doing full-sync may cause some short data plane
connectivity loss and is not needed if same controller is already
configured for the bridge.
With this patch neutron-ovs-agent will first check if controller is
configured for the bridge and if it's the same as what should be
configured, it will skip setting it up.

With this patch also protocols added to the bridge will be first checked
if they aren't already there and only missing ones will be added if
necessary.

Setting of the connectivity mode and inactivity probe is
always performed as this don't cause connectivity issues and is cheap
so we can always ensure that those parameters are configured properly.

autopep8 is a code formating tool that makes python code pep8
compliant without changing everything. Unlike black it will
not radically change all code and the primary change to the
existing codebase is adding a new line after class level doc strings.

This change adds a new tox autopep8 env to manually run it on your
code before you submit a patch, it also adds autopep8 to pre-commit
so if you use pre-commit it will do it for you automatically.

This change runs autopep8 in diff mode with --exit-code in the pep8
tox env so it will fail if autopep8 would modify your code if run
in in-place mode. This allows use to gate on autopep8 not modifying
patches that are submited. This will ensure authorship of patches is
maintianed.

The intent of this change is to save the large amount of time we spend
on ensuring style guidlines are followed automatically to make it
simpler for both new and old contibutors to work on nova and save
time and effort for all involved.

A continuation of [1] in which we are trying to reduce the dependency on
NovaServiceManager when interacting with cpu_dedicated_set and
cpu_shared_set.

This commit introduces two new configuration options:
 * whitebox_hardware.dedicated_cpus_per_numa
 * whitebox_hardware.shared_cpus_per_numa

These options describe the number of pCPUs alloacted to either shared or
dedicated sets for a given compute host. We are making the assumption
that although the pCPUs allocated to their respective sets may be
different on each compute host, the number of pCPUs allocated are the
same.

Commit also removes NSM from three of the four base emulator thread
testcases and reduces some of the complexity originally present in the
tests. Since vcpu_pin_set and cpu_dedicated_set are no longer
directly modified in the test, their respective child tests have been
removed leaving just the parent to covering scenarios based on the
deployment.

Some firmware seems to take an objection with EFI nvram
entries being deleted after one is added, resulting in the
entire entry table being reset to the last known good state.

This is problematic, as ultimately deployments can time out
if we previously booted with Networking, and the machine, while
commanded to do other wise, reboots back to networking regardless.

We will now delete entries first, before proceeding.

Additionally, for general use, this pattern may serve the
community better by avoiding cases where we would have
previously just relied upon efibootmgr[0] to warn us of duplicate
entries.

This reverts commit 89e321b7b5c88ab7cfab53103295774ca535f0df.

Reason for revert: The previous change require develper to install multiple spcific version python 
locally to run the test envs and it arbitrally pins lower constratins to the 
oldest python we support but lower contratis shoudl work with the newwst python we support too.
on fedora or other operating systems that ship with default python version that exceed our supported
versions test can be run with tox -e py38 if required.

similarly our updated constratins shoudl work with the older python.

This patch introduces a new parameter compute/allow_migration_across_az
so that operators can controll whether it is allowed to migrate an
instancde to a different availability zone.

It is useful to dislabe this parameter when cinder/cross_az_attach is
disabled, because it allows us to avoid issue caused by az mismatch
between an instance and its volumes after migration.

There are currently workloads that do not support live-migration during
the upgrades process. Example workloads include guests with SR-IOV
ports, pci-passthrough, ovs+dpdk vhost ports, or cpu pinning. Nova would
also like to test the results of upgrades when a workload is not
migrated off a host and is left in place.

This commit checks a workloads metadata and takes the appropriate action
based on the data. I.e. it will live, cold, or not migrate based on the
metadata of the instance. If no meta-data is present on the instance
describing the workload action, it will default to live migration unless
compute_cold_evacuate is set, in which case it will default to cold
migration.

This patch changes the blacklist scenario tests to use the test name
in the regex to make it more unique and easier to trace for debugging.

This patch clears up confusion resulting from both tripleo and
cinder creating ""default"" volume types. The quotes indicate subtle
differences in how the term is used, and how it causes confusion for
cloud users.

TripleO added support for configuring cinder's default volume type,
and later cinder itself added its own support for a default volume
type. The cinder project's motivation was to provide a volume type
for all volumes, even when cloud administrators hadn't defined one.
But from tripleo's perspective, cinder's volume type was redundant
because tripleo *does* define a default volume type.

The confusion for cloud users is that cinder chose ""__DEFAULT__"" for
the name of the volume type, and ""Default Volume Type"" for its
description. This is misleading because tripleo's CinderDefaultVolumeType
is the actual default volume type.

Clearing up the confusion depends on whether the overcloud is a green
field deployment where no volumes have been created, or a brown field
deployment where cinder's __DEFAULT__ type may be in use. If no volumes
exist then it's safe for tripleo to simply delete cinder's __DEFAULT__
type. Otherwise, the __DEFAULT__ type's description is updated so that
it indicates the actual default type is the one established by the
CinderDefaultVolumeType parameter.

Lastly, CinderDefaultVolumeType is now constrained to prevent it being
set to an empty string. That should never happen, so this is just a
safety net.

Add ping test for gateway IPs on all networks, to ensure
all gateways are reachable.

The releated Bugzilla reports an issue where some network
fabrics fail when using the current node ping test, which
pings the first node in each role. The fabric simply does
not forward traffic before the gateway has been pinged.

One can argue that the fabric in question is broken. However,
with the current implementation the first node in each role
actually ping tests only against it's own address? So adding
the test to ping the gateway addresses improves the validation
in general.

The NFS driver doesn't allow to delete snapshots in error state when
snapshot support is disable.

I'm facing some scenarios where snapshots are enabled then a snapshot
is created and after that then snapshots are disabled. This results
in error state snapshots that can't be deleted.  Another scenario is
- with nfs snapshot support disable from the beginning- the API layer
allows the snapshot to be created but the NFS driver sets the status
to ""error"" leaving the snapshot in the DB with error state.
Because of that, I have snapshots in error state that I'm not able
to delete.

The purpose of this fix allow deleting snapshots in error state.
It makes sense to block creating snapshots when snapshot support is
False. However, when deleting snapshot we don't want to block
attempts to delete a broken snapshot DB entry, which is necessary to
clean up a failed snapshot create.

One of the functionalities the dnf Ansible module misses is the single
disabling and disabling of DNF modules [0]. Currently only installation and
removal are supported.

The tripleo_dnf_stream module is based on the dnf.py Ansible core module [1]
(so it will be simpler to contribute with this functionality to upstream
Ansible core) and covers the enabling and disabling of one or multiple
MODULE:STREAM.

This functionality is required when performing a minor update, as we
need to make sure that a set of streams are enabled to provide with
the right packages [2]. In this situation, the installation of the
whole module is not really required as a full upgrade will run after.

The module uses the options name (MODULE:STREAM) and state:[disabled or
enabled]. Example:
    - name: Enable the container-tools:3.0
      tripleo_dnf_stream:
        - name: container-tools:3.0
          state: enabled

This commit updates the default manila policies in
enable-secure-rbac.yaml to implement consistent support for project
personas (project-admin, project-member, and project-reader) with other
OpenStack services. The project-admin is still considered a system
administrator.

This behavior will change in future releases (likely Yoga) when we have
a community wide goal to finish system-scope adoption. At that point, we can
remove these overrides and use the defaults in manila, which adhere to system
and project personas and we'll get more functionality without these overrides.

The MAC_Binding table in the SB database may grow indefinitely (due
to a lack of an aging mechanism of its entries) and eventually
lead to OOM killers for neutron-server which maintains an in-memory
copy of the database.

In order to stop monitoring this table, this patch is invoking
the ovsdb-client tool to remove the entries associated to
Floating IPs that have just been detached. The execution of this
tool is really fast as it will just invoke a JSON-RPC transact command
which doesn't require downloading the database contents.

In a scale test, the memory consumption of neutron-server dropped
from 75GB to 7GB with this patch.

Closes-Bug: #1946318

(Manually cherry picked from Neutron f6c35527698119ee6f73a6a3613c9beebb563840)

Note: The functional test has been changed for this stable branch
because the update_tables() method from ovsdbapp is not availabie for
this version of networking-ovn. So I changed the functional test to
add the MAC_Binding entry via ovsdb-client instead of using ovsdbapp
to do so.

As with WS-Man iDRAC API setting boot device requires creating BIOS
job and there can be only 1 open job per subsystem present in iDRAC,
there is validation to check that the job queue is empty before
continuing setting boot device. This does not work well for cases when
using autoupdatescheduler that creates `Repository Update` job that
stays Scheduled until executed and then followed by new Scheduled
`Repository Update` job.

This patch allows non-BIOS jobs to be present in the queue when setting
boot device. This will still fail for cases when there are BIOS jobs
present. In such cases should consider moving to idrac-redfish that
does not create BIOS or any other job to set boot device.

Currently the <service>::wsgi::apache::ssl parameters have inconsistent
default values. Some parameters default to true while the other default
to false.

Based on the following points, false is considered to be the more
reasonable default.
 - Usage of SSL is optional and is not always required
 - There are other methods(like load-balancer) to implement SSL
   termination
 - Enabling SSL doesn't work with the default values currently
   defined, and requires additional parameters like ssl_cert.
 - false is the default value defined in the base implementation in
   puppet-openstacklib.

This change is the preparation to change the default value, and
introduces a warning message to make users aware of the future change.

Since a couple of series those oslo projects produce
independent deliverables not synched with the coordinated
series, de facto, they are branchless projects.

I don't think is it possible to follow the stable policy
without related stable branches.

The independent deliverables aren't compatible with this
policy.

Also we should notice that keeping these deliverables
under the stable policy umbrella mislead downstream
maintainers. Removing them inform maintainers to stick
to the upper-constraints available for a given series.

left it in, and accounted for the active entry indicator flag

(cinder-multibackend-matrix-migration).

This job tests the migration between two different backends
specified through the volume.backend_names configuration

Now the job leverages the existing zuul code, namely the
run-tempest role, which is called multiple times with all
the possible combinations of the 3 tested backends
(lvm, ceph, nfs) where the source and the destination differ.

The final JUnitXML output summarizes the test results
for each of the tested combinations.

To check the existance of a namespace, instead of listing the
namespaces directory (by default ""/var/run/netns""), this patch
directly checks the existence of the namespace directory, using
""os.path.exists"".

This check is faster than listing the whole directory and avoids
timeout problems as reported in the related bug.

Nova and QEMU[1] supports PCI devices with a PCI address that has 16 bit
domain. However there are hypervisors that reports PCI addresses with
32 bit domain. While today we cannot assign these to guests this should
not prevent the nova-compute service to start.

This patch changes the PCI manager to ignore such PCI devices.

Please note that this patch does not change fact that nova does not
allow specifying PCI addresses with 32bit domain in the
[pci]/passthrough_whitelist configuration. Such configuration is still
rejected at nova-compute service startup.

The 3PAR driver creates new SSH connection to the backend for each
operation (eg. create/delete volume).

There is a limit on maximum number of SSH connections from 3PAR
backend i.e 24 connections.

The problem is that when multiple concurrent operations are
performed, this limit gets reached & further operations get
errored out.

This patch performs two things:
[a] Instead of creating new session for each operation, an attempt is
made to reuse existing session for as most operations.
[b] Since WSAPI of 3PAR has evolved, wsapi (http/https) requests are
used; thus SSH connections are no longer required.
