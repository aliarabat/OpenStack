The test_create_backup test creates two backup snapshot images of the
instance right away and waits for the instance to be ACTIVE before
continuing each time, and before creating the third and final backup
image.

The problem is the instance is always ACTIVE, it's the task state that
is transitioning on the instance while it's creating backup snapshot
instances and checking for old rotations to delete.

The test needs to not only check that the instance is ACTIVE before
creating each new backup but also that the snapshot image backups
themselves are ACTIVE which is a better indication that the instance's
state transition is complete.

Fix an issue we have with the formatting of our auto-generated
REST API documentation. Sphinxcontrib-pecanwsme does not like
single-line method doc strings.

This patch adds some description of the RESTful parameters.

For methods that take no parameters (eg, get_all) it simply
converts the doc strings to multi-line, even though this does not
adhere to PEP257. This is a work-around for a bug.

where it is not convenient to store clients in Scenario classes but making
use of caching in osclients.Clients makes sense.

Fixes bug 1252891

In order to add missing foreign key constraints, rows that reference a
nonexistant key need to be purged. Unfortunately, DB migration 209 does
not clean up any rows in child tables that themselves have a foreign key
constraint on the tables with the missing foreign keys. This can result
in an integrity violation causing the migration to fail.

When purging the rows, make sure to purge rows in any child tables first.

The check was also waiting for the agent on the notcompute node,
according to the commit message the compute node was what was
intended(which makes more sense), this commit also changes the
check to wait for the agent on compute.

In cases where Nova falls back to simply locally deleting an
instance, the Instance object was not updated with the deleted_at
generated by the database implementation. Due to this, the
notification emitted to signify that the delete finished was
getting emitted without a deleted_at value.

This change uses the result from the instance_destroy call to
update the Instance object with the latest state from the database.
Thus, the compute.instance.delete.end notification is emitted
with the proper deleted_at value.

Creating the ""_member_"" role and ""Member"" role creates confusion.
""_member_"" has special significance to keystone, so we keep that.

Horizon is modified to use ""_member_"" as the default role in [1].
This change should be merged after that.

Red Hat's QA noticed that in case of the infamous ""xattr>=0.4""

startup scripts (not Systemd though -- that one knows exactly
if processes run or not).

The easiest fix is to return the error code like Guido's blog

Reasons:
 - tox update v1.6

Changes:
 - tox 1.6 allows us to skip the sdist step, which is slow.
 - It also allows us to override the install line. In this case, it's
   important as it allows us to stop getting pre-release software we
   weren't asking for.

This changeset implements a KVS interface that makes use of
dogpile's backends.  Included is an in-memory database (primarily
to be used for testing) that isolates data from modification via
liberal use of copy.deepcopy.  The memcached backend is a manager
pivot to allow the use of the various dogpile.cache memcache
backends while maintaining a simplified interface.

The KVS system implements a Distributed-Capable locking system that
hooks into the dogpile.cache backend mutexes. Locking can be
toggled at configuration time for a given KeyValueStore
instantiation.

The original kvs implementation has been moved to
keystone.common.kvs.legacy.  For compatibility all elements of the
old keystone.common.kvs namespace have been made available at
keystone.common.kvs.  The legacy kvs implementation has been marked
for deprecation after the release of ICEHOUSE.

Dynamically adding or removing a device needs to be synchronized
to work around a bug in XenServer 6.1 and 6.2 where simultaneous
events can be partially ignored, leading to a failure to plug or
unplug.  The bug is between two internal components in XenServer
which pass messages - the first component will ignore all messages
from the second while a plug/unplug is in progress, expecting
only one message to be received.  If two plug/unplugs occur in
this time, an internal assertion is raised as XAPIs internal state
is inconsistent.

Change I7b86325714e38b00a2f51bbf083b5532a6c51fa9 attempted to
work around the issue by retrying - however that does not catch
all failures.  This change should eliminate some of the known
INTERNAL_ERROR failures, but not all, so I7b8 need not be
reverted.

Change Ie7a64c481a9e3874df9d5924fbb050ac7ab117db does the same
as this, but only for VBD.plug.

Unifies haproxy reference implementation to make common agent based plugin driver
which is suitable for all vendors who wants to use async mechanism.

 - Agent API as well as device driver API changed to handle
   loadbalancer objects individually;
 - Agent loads device drivers according to config;
 - LogicalDeviceCache class was removed from agent as it was used only
   as a list - to put and remove entries ant check whether entry is in or not.
   It was replaced with instance_mapping dict in agent to store known instances and
   corresponding device_drivers;
 - Agent reports which device drivers are supported (needs for scheduling on plugin side);
 - Agent-to-plugin API was extended to provide an ability for agent to update
   statuses of pools/vips/members/health_monitors;
 - Vendor should only implement device driver; plugin driver just needs
   to inherit AgentBasedPluginDriver and override device_driver member;
 - This patch doesn't move files to make review easier;
   all rename/replace will be done in a subsequent patch;

DocImpact

NOTE: Since the change in the agent RPC API is backward-incompatible
(major RPC version change), LBaaS server-agent communications will be
completely broken until both sides are upgraded so users will be unable to
create new or update existing HAProxy loadbalancer instances during upgrade

The DHCP agent will happily run multiple creation operations for a
network at the same time. Unfortunately they are not aware of each other
and can cause all sorts of issues. Deletion of a network while it is
also being created is a possibility as well.

This patch also includes some alterations of code that seems to often be
called after things have been deleted that are assumed to still be
around. This is causing a few unexpected exceptions and messing up
cleanup in several cases.

This commit message will need to be amended if it is an appropriate fix
because I really don't know how many bugs this will address at the
moment... except that is likely more than one.

of a misspelled 'encryption' key to retrieve image encryption
information returned by calls to the 'qemu-img' command. In addition
to fixing the key ('encryption' -> 'encrypted'), the QemuImgInfo class
attribute has been renamed to reflect the change and the encryption

tox 1.6 allows us to skip the sdist step, which is slow. This does that.
It also allows us to override the install line. In this case, it's
important as it allows us to stop getting pre-release software we
weren't asking for.

Reverting the change to the trove.test.conf so that the tox tests are
not so verbose with all the logging when running through the tests. It
makes it very difficult to find out what failed and where without much

This was a change i made so that when you do a './redstack start-fake'
it would show the logs in the screen session. But this turned out to be
a bad idea when running in tox.

This new chapter is taken from the common/ section, and explains how to
install clients on machines outside the OpenStack cluster. The install
guide can be misleading about how to use clients to administrate the
cloud, adding this section will hopefully help clarifying this.

pom.xml is modified to add an audience target (installer), used to build
specific parts of the common files.

Many plases in tests code use assertEqual(AA, None),
the same with True and False and negatives of such comparisons.

As comparison to singletons must use `is` operator, appropriate usage
is assertIs, assertIsNot, assertIsNone, assertIsNotNone

These assertions are provided by the `testtools` package,
so this change is not breaking backward compatibility with Python 2.6

This first patch inlcudes roughly half of the files touched by these changes
(up to and including test_n*) to ease the review.

tox 1.6 was released, which means that we can now take advantage of
the feature we added to it - which is using setup.py develop to
install the code into the virtualenv. The logic was taken from
run_tests.sh - so the performance issues around using tox vs. using
install_venv should now be gone.

Additionally, override the tox pip install command to avoid using the
""--pre"" option which is the default in tox.  ""--pre"" means ""Include
pre-release and development versions.""  By default, pip will only
install stable versions of software, and that is the behavior we want.

In Cinder to clone a volume we typically take a snapshot
of an LVM, create a new volume and dd the contents of the
snap to the new volume, then delete the snap.

For linear LVM this is fine because there's a signficant
performance penalty for having snapshots of an LVM volume.

With LVM thin however this isn't the case as all the data blocks
are shared in the pool.  This means we can create and actually use
snapshots, and delete parent LV's without issue.

This change implements the use of snapshots for operations like
clone (create from volume) and create from snapshot.  Rather than
do the intermediate snapshot and dd, we just create an LVM snapshot
with the volume properties and use it.

The files that nova shares with libvirt and QEMU may contain user
sensitive information and it might be a problem if those files are
visible for all the users in the machine. These files include the images
under instances_dir, the base images and snapshots.

This patch uses the decorator introduced in the previous patch, which
will change the user file-creation mask temporarily, during the call of
a method, allowing us to mark methods that shouldn't create world
readable files and thus, protecting them.

Also in this patch, all the calls that interact with libvirt owned files
have been modified to use rootwrap so they can still access these files
(for resizing or creating an image or when migrating an instance).

As a side effect, by setting the proper permissions to libvirt files and
accessing them using rootwrap, this patch avoids problems with cached file
attributes that might trigger problems as the one described in bug 1218372

volume_clear to each backend, but it does impact usability and

Previously, one could update a port's device_id to be that of
another tenant's instance_id and then be able to retrieve that
instance's metadata. In order to prevent this X-Tenant-ID is now
passed in the metadata request to nova and nova then checks that
X-Tenant-ID also matches the tenant_id for the instance against it's
database to ensure it's not being spoofed.

DocImpact - When upgrading OpenStack nova and neturon, neutron
            should be updated first (and neutron-metadata-agent
            restarted before nova is upgraded) in order to minimize
            downtime. This is because there is also a patch to nova
            which has checks X-Tenant-ID against it's database
            therefore neutron-metadata-agent needs to pass that
            before nova is upgraded for metadata to work.

who wrote the thread pool code was afraid of regressions for existing

that this is always set to True or else users can have issues with

good so it doesn't mask the original libvirt failure in

In test_server_actions.py, one server is created in setUpClass()
and the server would be shared between all tests.
If the server status is not 'ACTIVE' before each test, rebuild_
server() deletes it and rebuilds a server again.

The server_id scope which is passed to rebuild_server() is class
variable not instance variable. In addition, the server_id scope
which is stored with the return value of rebuild_server() is
instance variable like the following:

  [[instance]]                         [[class]]
  self.server_id = self.rebuild_server(self.server_id)

If we need to rebuild a server, the server_id, which is passed to
rebuild_server(), cannot be changed due to its scope. As the result,
many server creations happens in each test.
Then it causes ""Quota exceeded"" exception.

This patch fixes the scope of server_id for sharing the same server
between each tests.

Code handling agents status updates coming via RPC checks,
if a corresponding entry for the given (agent_type, host)
pair already exists in DB and updates it. And if it doesn't
exist, a new entry is created.

Without a unique constraint this can cause a race condition
resulting in adding of two agent entries having the same value
of (agent_type, host) pair.

Note, that it's already not allowed to have multiple agents of
the same type having the same host value, but currently it's
enforced only at code level, not at DB schema level, which
effectively makes race conditions possible.

The @memoized decorator cannot cache function calls that take unhashable
arguments. So far it just ignored them, and silently called the function
directly without any cache. This commit adds a warning in such case, so
that we can see where @memoized is not really doing anything.

I used Python's warning mechanism, because we can easily configure the
particular warning to become an exception or to be ignored entirely.

tox 1.6 was released, which means that we can now take advantage of
the feature we added to it - which is using setup.py develop to
install the code into the virtualenv. The logic was taken from
run_tests.sh - so the performance issues around using tox vs. using
install_venv should now be gone.

Additionally, override the tox pip install command to avoid using the
""--pre"" option which is the default in tox.  ""--pre"" means ""Include
pre-release and development versions.""  By default, pip will only
install stable versions of software, and that is the behavior we want.

With the addition of ChanceWeigher, the policies of both the chance
and simple schedulers can now be implemented using the filter
scheduler. Keeping these schedulers unnecessarily increases the test
matrix and significantly increases the development effort of new
features that require scheduler support.

1. Integrated unit tests will now use the default scheduler.
2. For now, print a warning if either of these schedulers is used.
3. New features that require scheduler functions need not add support
   for simple and chance. Any bugs found should still be fixed.

Horizon's __init__.py has some code that explicitly allows it to
be imported by setup.py before Django is set up, by making import
failures just throw a warning instead of an exception. But that code
is defeated by a bunch of asserts that were added later, that just
make the error even more confusing.

I'm removing the asserts and replacing them with __all__.

add ordering

Fix bug with auto_assignment for Savanna + Neutron

[nailgun] New node naming convention in ssh.config

The slave nodes are called node-NN now istead of slave-NN.

	Flush IPs on all interfaces that are members of a bond

	- This is needed to prevent the situation when Puppet
	is trying to assign an IP to bond, which is already in
	use on some of bonded interfaces.

There are two changes in this proposal. One is to move the logic
for extracting cell data from the row datum (and handling auto columns)
to the Cell class, into a separate method for easy extending. The
second is to make that extending possible by making the cell class
configurable in the DataTable's meta.

Those changes are supposed to make it easier to extend the DataTable
with new kinds of cells -- for example, cells that contain an editable
widget, a progress bar, an icon, etc. as well as make it easier to
modify the behavior of the auto columns -- for example, by making it
possible to have some of the multi_select checkboxes preselected. Those
changes would also make it easier to integrate DataTable with a Django
FormSet.

Right now, in order to modify any of the proposed Cell.get_data
behavior, one has to make their own Row class and practically copy-paste
the whole Row.load_cells method, as there is no easy way to extend it.

Currently BatchAction message is generated by concatenating
'action' and 'data_type'. In most cases 'action' is a verb
and 'data_type' is an object. However in some action such as
TerminateInstance 'action' is a combination of verb and
object (e.g., ""Scheduled termination of"").  It is hard that
translators find translated strings which covers both cases.

This commit allows classes inheriting BatchAction to specify
a full action name containing '%(data_type)s' substitution
in action_present/ action_past so that translators can
control the order of phrases completely.

* _conjugate() in actions.py is renamed to _get_action_name()
  because this method no longer always conjugate words.
* Changes action_past strings which are not a form of verb + obj
  to strings with ""%(data_type)s""

The TC applies a number of criteria when considering project incubation
and graduation to integrated status, and when considering new programs.
These reference documents should track the minimal requirements that we
apply, so that candidate projects and teams know what is expected of
them.

These documents, by nature, do not contain all the criteria that each
member of the TC will apply when evaluating applications. They are
just the ever-evolving minimal set of requirements that are consensual
amongst TC members.

NB: Some currently-incubated, currently-integrated or currently-official
projects and programs do not fill all of those requirements, as some of
them are new requirements we recently imposed to raise the quality of
the end-result, based on past experience. Those teams and projects
should try to cover the gap during the Icehouse cycle.
