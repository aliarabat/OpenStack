If an aggregate fails to be created for some reason, for example because
the requested node is not in the freepool, some cleanup occurs. Part of
the cleanup is ensuring the target node is moved _back_ to the freepool.
This should theoretically ""heal"" cases where the node wasn't in the
freepool but also wasn't in some lease aggregate.

However, this call to Nova's API refers to the freepool aggregate by its
name, which is not supported here: the ID must be used[1]. This caused
this operation to fail and raise a NotFound, confusingly (because Nova
couldn't find an aggregate with ID='freepool' for example.)

In test_agent_management some tests depend on one agent to be unmodified
which was not guaranteed as some tests updated that agent.
The update happened because the update test assumed that neutron will
return list of agents in different order.
The fix is only to select always different agent for update than the one
used for other tests.

Tempest has defined the base job 'devstack-tempest-ipv6' which will
deploy services on IPv6.

This commit adds the new job 'senlin-tempest-api-ipv6-only'
run on gate which is derived from 'devstack-tempest-ipv6'.

Verification structure will be:
- 'devstack-IPv6' deploy the service on IPv6
- 'devstack-tempest-ipv6' run will verify the IPv6-only setting and listen address
- 'senlin-tempest-api-ipv6-only' will run the tests.

This doesn't add anything qualitatively different. It
adds polish in terms of formatting, slight word changes,
fixes broken links, and moves the order of a paragraph.

The Upgrading OpenStack section re placement was changed
to sync to what is in app-upgrade-openstack.rst (CDG).

Removed text on Ceph was transferred to

For some reason, probably because build requests are meant to be short lived
and we don't get a lot of bugs about paging misbehavior, when paging instances
with a marker, we didn't raise MarkerNotFound if we didn't find the marker in
the list of build requests. Doing so would match what we do when paging over
cells and listing instances using a marker. Once we find the marker, be that
in build_requests, or one of the cells, we need to set the marker to None to
stop looking for it elsewhere if we have more space to fill our limit.

For example, see change I8a957bebfcecd6ac712103c346e028d80f1ecd7c.

This patch fixes the issue by raising MarkerNotFound from BuildRequestList
get_by_filters if there is a marker and we didn't find a build request for
it. The compute API get_all() method handles that as normal and continues
looking for the marker in one of the cells.

Plugin documentation previously used ``.. list-plugins::`` for each
plugin command, which just produced the summary line. This might be
useful if there were also a link to the complete (per-project) docs for
the commands; but since we have the content available, we might as well
produce the complete plugin docs inline. That's going to be most useful
to a reader anyway.

So this commit switches from ``list-plugins`` to ``autoprogram-cliff``
-- except for the following, whose docs break the build when this is
done:

- octavia

- trove
- zun

With compute API microversion 2.53 there is a single
PUT /os-services/{service_id} API which takes the service
id as a UUID. Since the openstack compute service set
command only takes --host and --service (binary) to identify
the service, this change checks if 2.53 or greater is being
used and if so, looks up the service by host and binary and
calls the appropriate methods in novaclient.

If the command cannot uniquely identify a compute service
with the given host and binary, an error is raised. A future
change could add an --id option to be used with 2.53+ to
pass the service id (as UUID) directly to avoid the host/binary
filtering.

With compute API microversion 2.53, nova-compute services
can only be deleted with the ID as a UUID to uniquely identify
the service in a multi-cell deployment. This documents that for
the ""compute service delete <service>"" argument. The description
of the ""compute service list"" command is also updated to mention
that the ID can be retrieved as a UUID using 2.53 or greater.

When calling certain group or user APIs, keystone logic would attempt
to figure out the domain to scope responses to. This was specific to
enabling domain-specific driver support, where each domain is backed
by a different identity store. This functionality is turned off by
default. Since system-scoped tokens are not associated to a domain
(unlike project-scoped tokens or domain-scoped tokens), the logic to
determine a domain from a system-scoped token was breaking and
returning an erroneous HTTP 401 Unauthorized when system users
attempted to list users or groups.

This commit adds support for domain detection with system-scoped
tokens.

Fix service_name when calling process_certificates so it matches
what ApacheSSLContext expects.

Ceilometers Apache config is rendered using
ceilometer_contexts.ApacheSSLContext. This class is a subclass of
charmhelpers.contrib.openstack.context.ApacheSSLContext. The
ceilometer specialised class sets 'service_namespace = ""ceilometer""'.
This is then used by parent class to set the destination for certs
and keys to:

ssl_dir = os.path.join('/etc/apache2/ssl/', self.service_namespace)

The code to process incoming certificates from the certificates
relation does something very similar.
charmhelpers.contrib.openstack.cert_utils.process_certificates
takes a service_name parameter. It uses this to set the destination
directory that incoming certificates will be stored in:

ssl_dir = os.path.join('/etc/apache2/ssl/', service_name)

Obviously these two ssl directories need to match. But they do not
because process_certificates is currently called like this:

cert_utils.process_certificates('ceilometer-api', relation_id, unit)

The keystone-to-keystone auth flow diagram contained a minor error that
could lead to confusion. When a client POSTs a SAMLResponse to the PAOS
URL of the keystone Service Provider, the response is not automatically
a keystone token but an HTTP redirect that indicates the session is
successfully authenticated. The client then must ignore the Location
header of the redirect and instead start the token request process with
keystone's federated authentication endpoint. This change adds the extra
step to the diagram to help clarify the process.

This change is being backported because it provides a helper method in

If a user has a role assignment on the system, which implies another
role assignment, the system-scoped token response should include
both role assignments.

This patch exposes a bug in the system-scoped token implementation
where implied roles aren't expanded out before returning the
token response to the user.

Microversion 2.20 allows attaching a volume to a shelved-offloaed
instance. Since a shelved-offloaded instance does not have a host
associated it, a block device name is not reserved on the compute host
for the instance, since there is no compute host for the instance,
so BlockDeviceMapping.device_name is just set to None.

When showing details on this attached volume for a shelved offloaded
server, we get a 404 since it has some obscure legacy check for the
mountpoint to be set, assumingly to fill the response. Note, however,
that listing attachments does not care if there is a mountpoint. When
listing attachments, if there is no mountpoint the 'device' key is just
not part of the response.

To fix the 404, if there is no mountpoint and the instance is shelved
offloaded, we just return device=None.

This should not require a microversion bump since this code was
enforcing this mountpoint restriction long before the 2.20 use case
existed, and the 2.20 change arguably regressed this API. A user should
not have to attach a volume to a shelved offloaded server at 2.20 and then
have to use 2.43 to show details about that volume attachment. We do,
however, maintain backward compatibility with the response body such that
the 'device' key is still part of the response, even though the value is
None.

The current implementation of the method '_destroy_evacuated_instances'
in compute.manager deletes any instances from source after they have
been evacuated.

There is a possibility that if a VM fails as part of rebuild operation
on destination host after creating a migration record, then when the source
host is brought back up it may end up deleting the VM from source as well.

To fix this we should check the 'host' attribute in instances table before
deleting the VM and delete VM from source only if the host has been updated
in db after rebuild

It turns out many operators expect Nova to create ports using the admin
context, and have disabled the ability for regular users to create
ports. While we no longer need to use the admin context to create ports
(because we do the port binding via an update_port call), there is also
no good reason to break the users that expect us to use the admin
context to create ports.

Longer term, we should be making our request using a token that
represents both the user context and the Nova service user, so we can
avoid using such a powerful admin context for all these operations.
Once that is turned on by default, and the default policy is updated in
neutron, we should be good to get rid of this.

In the backport [0] it was removed the loop that iterated
over each role to create the upgrade_steps_tasks playbook
and included the generation as part of the previous
secion (pre_upgrade_rolling_steps_playbook) loop.
This causes the upgrade to stop working as upgrade_steps_
tasks will be build for only one role (the last we iterated
over in the previous loop) and running the upgrade for any
other role will end up in all the upgrade_tasks being
skipped.

In general we need to make use of the cinder datastore when booting
from a volume. In the event that the instance is unable to acces the
volume as cinder may select a datastore that is not accesible by the
host (this is when storage policies are not used).

We need to ensure that the cinder volume type is honored. If and only
if the volume is not accesible then we should reolcate.

This change bundles two fixes for CI-breaking
bugs and which hence need to be pushed together.

bug #1846601 / Fix TypeError when calling join on bytes sequence

In bagpipe_bgp.common.run_command module output and error
of command are of type ""bytes"" instead of ""string"".
That causes some issues when it's running on Python 3.

So this patch fixes it by converting those variables always to
the string type.

bug #1846767 / Force copy of dict items in ""for"" loop

In module bagpipe_bgp.common.dataplane_utils in
ObjectLifecycleManager.clear_objects() method there is for loop
which iterates over items from dict.
To avoid changes of dict during iterations this patch forces always
to create list which is copy of items from dict.

Previously the pagination marker was not being set for list
queries where `uuid` was not in the list of requested fields.
The affected endpoints were: port, portgroup, volume_target,
volume_connector, node and chassis.

The next marker contains the UUID of the last element that
was returned to the client. This information was being
removed from elements in the collection. This meant that we
could no longer return a UUID for this marker. An extra
parameter, `sanitize` was added to `convert_with_links`.
This allows us to delay stripping this field from the
elements until after the next marker has been set.

This fixes errors that occur when building PDF versions of the
docs.

svg2pdf is added as a docs dependency because the SVG images
can not be included in PDFs natively.

The literalinclude of nova.conf is too large and exceeds TeX's
memory limit in most environments.  To avoid this, we omit
this from PDF builds, but retain it in HTML builds.  In the
future, folks may wish to explore breaking the config file into
smaller sections which would solve this problem and potentially
improve the readability in the HTML form.

The nesting of the API reference is too deep for standard LaTeX.
However, Sphinx provides an override setting.  Here it is set
to 10 which is more than necessary for the current level of
nesting.

Add a functional regression test for the referenced bug:

If a migration is initiated, and update_available_resource runs on the
destination between when the migration record is associated with the
destination and when the migration context is added to the instance, it
will raise a TypeError attempting to _populate_assigned_resources for
that instance, because that method attempts to access the
(as-yet-nonexistent) migration context.

Note that this doesn't fail the migration; it just leaves ugly logs. In
real life it probably also leaves other pieces of
update_available_resource unfinished on the destination.

The ResourceTracker knows when it created a new compute
node record and thus would need to create its corresponding
resource provider in placement. So one would think that the
RT could just avoid doing that ""ensure resource provider"" check
on each periodic for an existing compute node record, but
because of nested resource providers, we need to continue to
always call _ensure_resource_provider which also fetches
any nested providers via GET /resource_providers?in_tree=<uuid>,
and nested providers can be added/removed from the tree out
of band by other projects like neutron and cyborg. So since
we can't avoid the in_tree call on each periodic, we might as
well just remove the TODO associated with it.

Blueprint custom-resource-classes-in-flavors in Pike added
support for reporting custom resource class inventory for
ironic instances and the ability to schedule to ironic nodes
based on that custom resource class being in flavor extra specs.
The goal was to eventually stop scheduling ironic instances based
on the standard VCPU, MEMORY_MB and DISK_GB resource classes and
just use the single custom resource class defined on the node
itself.

As part of that work, a data migration was added for existing
ironic instances to report their custom resource class usage
in the embedded instance.flavor.extra_specs.

Also in Pike the nova-scheduler started creating resource
allocations during scheduling, which before Pike was handled
by the ResourceTracker in the nova-compute service. Once all
computes were upgraded to at least Pike, the ResourceTracker
would no longer report those allocations. This was problematic
for existing ironic instances created before Pike since their
allocations were no longer being reported to placement which
meant the scheduler could incorrectly try to schedule new instances
to an already at-capacity node. This was fixed with change
Ibbf65a8d817d359786abcdffa6358089ed1107f6 to always report
allocations from nova-compute for ironic instances.

Another problem existed because even if ironic instances had
their embedded flavor migrated to report custom resource usage,
the driver would still report standard resource class inventory
which meant the scheduler could incorrectly try to schedule
non-baremetal flavors to ironic nodes. Since the code that reported
standard resource class inventory was removed in Stein with change
If2b8c1a76d7dbabbac7bb359c9e572cfed510800, a stable-branch only
workaround was added in Id3c74c019da29070811ffc368351e2238b3f6da5
so deployments that had completed the data migration for their
ironic instances could configure nova-compute to set
[workarounds]/report_ironic_standard_resource_class_inventory=False
so the driver would no longer report standard resource class inventory.
Note that the code to always report ironic instance allocations from
the compute service was also removed in Stein with change
If272365e58a583e2831a15a5c2abad2d77921729.

However (now we get to the current bug), if the driver no longer
reports standard resource class inventory but the standard resource
class usage on existing embedded instances does not have zeroed out
values for those standard resource classes, because of the fix for
Ibbf65a8d817d359786abcdffa6358089ed1107f6 the ResourceTracker will
try to report allocations to placement for the standard resource
classes which will fail if the ironic node resource provider does
not have standard resource class inventory - which happens if
report_ironic_standard_resource_class_inventory=False.

Given reporting standard resource class inventory and usage has been
removed in Stein this is not really an issue for Stein, but the
embedded flavor data migration code still exists in Stein and this
change deals with zero'ing out the embedded standard resource class
usage so it does not get reported to the scheduler (which as noted
above can fail depending on configuration). It should also be noted
that the standard resource class zero'ing out should have always
been a part of the data migration introduced in Pike, there is even
a comment about it in the code itself:

""This code can be removed in Queens, and will need to be updated to
also alter extra_specs to zero-out the old-style standard resource
classes of VCPU, MEMORY_MB, and DISK_GB.""

This change implements the latter part of that statement. Note that
even though the standard resource classes will be zeroed out in
the embedded instance flavor, that only overrides what is reported
to placement (it actually causes those resource classes to *not* be
reported for allocations - which is the fix), the vcpus/ram/disk
attributes on the flavor itself are left untouched so the user can
still get them as display information about their instance in the API.

Since Pike it has been possible to schedule ironic nodes
using custom resource classes. As part of that change, existing
ironic instances needed to undergo a data migration and until
that data migration was complete, ironic compute services needed
to continue reporting standard resource class inventory.

Once the data migration is complete, the problem with continuing
to report standard resource class inventory is non-baremetal
flavors can get scheduled to ironic nodes.

The standard resource class inventory reporting was removed
from the ironic driver in Stein:

Therefore as a stable-only workaround, this change adds an
option for operators to disable reporting standard resource
class inventory for ironic nodes once they have confirmed that
their ironic instance data migrations are complete, which they
can do via the related ""nova-status upgrade check"" added in
change Ifd22325e849db2353b1b1eedfe998e3d6a79591c.

Since Pike it has been possible to schedule ironic nodes
using custom resource classes. As part of that change, existing
ironic instances needed to undergo a data migration and until
that data migration was complete, ironic compute services needed
to continue reporting standard resource class inventory.

Once the data migration is complete, the problem with continuing
to report standard resource class inventory is non-baremetal
flavors can get scheduled to ironic nodes.

The standard resource class inventory reporting was removed
from the ironic driver in Stein:

  If2b8c1a76d7dbabbac7bb359c9e572cfed510800

Therefore as a stable-only workaround, this change adds an
option for operators to disable reporting standard resource
class inventory for ironic nodes once they have confirmed that
their ironic instance data migrations are complete, which they
can do via the related ""nova-status upgrade check"" added in
change Ifd22325e849db2353b1b1eedfe998e3d6a79591c.

When an user calls the GET on an ironic resource it returns
MAX_LIMIT number of resources at a time along with a next url.
The default MAX_LIMIT is 1000.

If the user requested specific set of fields from ironic API
using the fields query parameter (eg: /v1/resource?fields=f1,f2,f3)
The next url returned by the API ignores fields query parameter.
This results in fields missing from the results after MAX_LIMIT
is reached.

This change fixes this problem by passing the fields as parameter
to collections.get_next method and using the fields argument to
build the query parameter.

When a namespace is deleted, kuryr-controller is in charge of
deleting its associated openstack resources (net, subnet and ports)
as well as the associated KuryrNet CRD.

As removing OpenStack resources may take some time, if the
kuryr-controller is restarted by any different reason during that
process, the resources will be left behind as no new events for the
namespace (already deleted) will happen after the restart. This
patch fixes this problem by ensuring upon reboot that there are no
orphan KuryrNet CRDs for unexisting namespaces, and deleting them
in case there are (including its associated OpenStack resources).

A powerful metric to watch for a swift cluster is the
number of handoff partitions on a drive on a storage node.

A build up of handoff nodes on a particular server could
indicate a disk problem somewhere in the cluster. A bottleneck
somewhere. Or better, when would be a good time to rebalance
the ring (as you'd want to do it when existing backend data
movement is at a minimum.

So it turns out to be a great visualisation of the health of
a cluster.

That's what this check plugin does. Each instance check takes
the following values:

  ring: <path to a Swift ring file>
  devices: <path to the directory of mountpoints>
  granularity: <either server or device>

To be able to determine primary vs handoff partitions on a drive
the swift ring needs to be consulted. If a storage node stores
more then 1 ring, and an instance would be defined for each.

You give swift a bunch of disks. These disks are placed in what
swift calls the 'devices' location. That is a directory where a
mount point for each mounted swift drive is located.

Finally, you can decide on the granularity, which defaults to
`server` if not defined. Only 2 metrics are created from this
check:

  swift.partitions.primary_count
  swift.partitions.handoff_count

But with the hostname dimension a ring dimension will also be set.
Allowing the graphing of the handoff vs partitions of each ring.
When the granularity is set to device, then an additional
dimension to the metric is added, the device name (the name of
the devices mount point). This allows the graphing and monitoring
of each device in a server if a finer granularity is required.

Because we need to consult the Swift ring there is a runtime
requirement on the Python Swift module being installed. But
this isn't required for the unit tests. Making it a runtime
dependency means when the check is loaded it'll log an error
and then exit if it can't import the swift module.

This is the second of two Swift check plugins I've been working on.

- Expand on supported config file locations
- Add a section on using conditionals in the config file

This change works around the current problem of networking-calico
being incompatible with OpenStack master CI (because of [1]), so that
we can get other useful changes into networking-calico.  It changes
the master devstack CI run to be non-voting, and adds a voting
devstack run against OpenStack Rocky.  I've chosen Rocky because

- it was the earliest release where the devstack code supports running
on Bionic, and the OpenStack CI VMs are all now Bionic

- networking-calico's tempest testing passes with Rocky.

But it's possible that we'd be OK with Stein as well.

(Train has just been released, and I'm pretty sure the latest breakage
[1] was introduced before that release, so I expect that we would not
be OK testing against Train.)

[1] I believe the problem in master is an incorrect assumption in
python-openstackclient, that the Neutron plugin provides the 'routes'
extension.  In fact that extension is optional and the Calico Neutron
plugin does not provide it.  I've posted
https://review.opendev.org/#/c/685312/ to correct that assumption.

Currently both nova evacuate and fence compute in the Instance HA

With this patch we introduce the keystone_tenant parameter which is
needed when moving to the nova service user as it is different than
keystone_admin in that case.

Tested as follows:
1. Deployed a normal unpatched OSP13 with IHA
2. Run a redeploy with the following addition:

  ExtraConfig:
    tripleo::profile::base::pacemaker::instance_ha::keystone_password: ""%{hiera('nova::keystone::authtoken::password')}""

3.2. IHA still works correctly

Instead of manually curating a list of all the subprojects in a
project, we should use the governance repo that already includes
most, if not all, of this information.

For the moment, this change just adds the governance data to the
data already in the json files. This is because I'm not sure whether
there is a 1:1 relationship between what is in governance and what
is in the json files. It's possible we could eliminate the json files
entirely at some point, but for the moment this gets us updated
subproject lists for essentially free, since it's likely that many
projects' json files are missing subprojects added in the past few
years.

Bug: attach_handle's in-use status should not be changed from 1(True) to 0(False)

This bug was caused by:
drv_ah_make_diff in cyborg/conductor/manager.py
https://github.com/openstack/cyborg/blob/2bd24b9da0a6f8a16822215eb3b2fe37534b0c72/cyborg/conductor/manager.py#L342

Actually we don't need to update attach_handle's in_use state
when doing cycle periodic inspections.

So just removing this field.

After we delete this field, the in-use's value keeps to 1(True)
When creating vm successfully.

Currently, the serial console is hardcoded to ttyS0 in the bootloader
element.  This is a challenge for users that want to build images for
some baremetal servers. Supermicro servers, for example, use ttyS1 for
the serial over lan interface.

This patch adds a new environment variable DIB_BOOTLOADER_SERIAL_CONSOLE
that can be set to override the default.

Consolidate post deploy configurations in a single file. Octavia
controller services share many configurations. It is best to consolidate
them in the same configuration file. This fixes problems seen like
amphorae not having the controller_ip_port_list config value set on
failover triggered by the Health Manager service as that config was only
being loaded for the Worker service.

Per the linked bugs, this does not seem to have a quick resolution.
The bug mentions that the copr nightly repos have other known issues,
so there just does not seem to be a good solution until fixed packages
are imported upstream.  For now, pause Fedora jobs to get the gate
working.

The default does not include it.

Nova docs:
RetryFilter - Deprecated since version 20.0.0 (Train)
Since the 17.0.0 (Queens) release, the scheduler has provided
alternate hosts for rescheduling so the scheduler does not need to
be called during a reschedule which makes the RetryFilter useless.

CentOS sets a restrictive umask by default that will override the
rsyslog file permissions settings. This can cause our tempest tests
to no be able to read the log offload files in our CentOS gate jobs.
This patch clears this umask override in the devstack rsyslog
configuration.

Note: This is a global setting for rsyslog and you probably do not
      want to set this outside of a testing environment.

to list shares using the `--limit` option.
This change was tested in a very busy environment with 800 shares.
Before the change, the operation took about 25 seconds to be
finished. Now, the operation takes about 3 seconds in the same

Currently both nova evacuate and fence compute in the Instance HA
setup of tripleo user the keystone admin user in order to query nova,
evacuate instances, disable/enable the nova-compute service and
call the nova force-down API.

With this patch we introduce the keystone_tenant parameter which is
needed when moving to the nova service user as it is different than
keystone_admin in that case.

Tested as follows:
1. Deployed a normal unpatched OSP13 with IHA
2. Run a redeploy with the following addition:
parameter_defaults:
  ExtraConfig:
    tripleo::profile::base::pacemaker::instance_ha::keystone_password: ""%{hiera('nova::keystone::authtoken::password')}""
    tripleo::profile::base::pacemaker::instance_ha::keystone_admin: 'nova'
    tripleo::profile::base::pacemaker::instance_ha::keystone_tenant: 'service'
3. Observe the following:
3.1. Both the fence_compute and nova evacuate resources have updated attributes
3.2. IHA still works correctly

Some services, like Nova, default to requiring auth for their
versioned discovery documents. This means strict discovery
does not work on them, because discovery as it is now defaults
to not sending auth. Just changing the default would be a behavior
change resulting in sending unneeded data with *every* request.
Instead, respond to Unauthorized exceptions by retrying the request
with auth token. This way discovery will work for services that
are otherwise blocking unauthenticated access, and will get more
efficient over time as those services improve.

like the response body down below:

we may get exception in nova compute log like this:

The job broke around mid June and has not been fixed since that time.
Plus, Fedora 28 is no longer supported by the Fedora project and is not
tested by any of our dsvm scenario jobs. It is time to delete the job
from the periodic queue.

The community is more than welcome to help restore Fedora-based amphora
image builds. One might be interested in picking help change
https://review.opendev.org/#/c/673173/ where the build was successful
but was did not pass the dsvm scenario job.

In the resource tracker, we get a list of migrations and rely on the
Migration.instance property to look up the related instance. This
doesn't actually cache the instance, which means repeated calls will
continue to trigger RPC and DB hits. Further, in resource tracker,
we have already pulled a list of instances and then proceed to re-query
them through lazy-loads from the migration objects, even though we
already have them. To add insult to injury, neither this first list
of instances, nor the ones pulled from Migration.instance contain
instances with the 'flavor' or 'migration_context' properties
populated, which means we trigger *two* more lazy loads to pull those.

This patch does a few things:
 - Makes the Migration object cache its instance property
 - Makes the resource tracker request instances with flavors and the
   migration_context populated
 - Stitches the instance list into the migration list to avoid the
   two subsequent lazy loads of Instance and Instance.flavor

The method `Fernet.generate_key()` generates a binary string in Python 3:
```
>>> Fernet.generate_key()
b'qSMZlOK23pZUw_Uyy-ZRPUfPskMXKGCGmhG6AHCFiV8='
```

Unless properly written as a string to the Kolla `passwords.yml` file,
the Fernet key will end up in the final Barbican config like this:
```
[simple_crypto_plugin]
kek = b'qSMZlOK23pZUw_Uyy-ZRPUfPskMXKGCGmhG6AHCFiV8='
```

Due to the fact that the key is incorrectly written to the barbican
config file (it should be written as a string), every barbican secret
store fails with:

```

This commit fixes the issue described above by properly writing
the Fernet key as a string to the Kolla `passwords.yml` file.

The prepare-workspace-git role recently replaced the use-cached-repos
role, but its behavior is slightly different. While use-cached-repos
removed the 'origin' remote, prepare-workspace-git replaces it with a
zuul fake origin.

Release jobs used to add an 'origin' remote to enable notes fetching.
Those jobs now fail because the 'origin' remote already exists. We
fix this by resetting the URL for the 'origin' remote, instead of
adding a new one.

This change adds a new conductor sub-task which will make a
synchronous RPC call (using long_rpc_timeout) to the new method
""prep_snapshot_based_resize_at_source"" on the source compute.

If the instance is not volume-backed, the sub-task will create
an image and pass the image ID to the compute method to upload
the snapshot data.

If the migration fails at this point, any snapshot image created should
be deleted. Recovering the guest on the source host should be as simple
as hard rebooting the server (which is allowed with servers in ERROR
status).

This adds a new compute service method prep_snapshot_based_resize_at_source
which will be synchronously called over RPC from (super)conductor to the
source host during a cross-cell resize which will:

* Power off the instance
* Upload snapshot data if the instance is not volume-backed
* Delete the old BDM volume attachment records
* Destroy the guest on the hypervisor but retain disks in the
  case of a later fault or revert
* Activate the dest host port bindings

Think of this as a hybrid of how shelve_instance and resize_instance
work, with a lot of the flow matching what the migrate_disk_and_power_off
compute driver method does except for transferring disks to the dest host.

Also note that resources are not freed up from the ResourceTracker on
the source host at this point, nor are the instance.host/node values
nulled out since we are keeping a ""placehoder"" on the source in case
something fails later or the user reverts the resize.

This adds the sub-task to prep/verify the target host(s)
for the resize in the target cell. The PrepResizeAtDestTask
sub-task will make a synchronous RPC call (using
long_rpc_timeout) to method prep_snapshot_based_resize_at_dest
on the dest compute service which will claim resources on
the target host. The task also creates (inactive) port
bindings and volume attachments to be used on the target host.

If the prep task on the selected target host fails with a
MigrationPreCheckError, conductor will iterate over alternate
hosts and check them until a suitable target host is found
or we raise MaxRetriesExceeded.

The instance.migration_context is returned from the task so
it can be copied from the target DB to the source DB. This is
necessary for the API to route network-vif-plugged events later
when spawning the guest in the target cell.

The method `Fernet.generate_key()` generates a binary string in Python 3:
```
>>> Fernet.generate_key()
b'qSMZlOK23pZUw_Uyy-ZRPUfPskMXKGCGmhG6AHCFiV8='
```

Unless properly written as a string to the Kolla `passwords.yml` file,
the Fernet key will end up in the final Barbican config like this:
```
[simple_crypto_plugin]
kek = b'qSMZlOK23pZUw_Uyy-ZRPUfPskMXKGCGmhG6AHCFiV8='
```

Due to the fact that the key is incorrectly written to the barbican
config file (it should be written as a string), every barbican secret
store fails with:

```

This commit fixes the issue described above by properly writing
the Fernet key as a string to the Kolla `passwords.yml` file.

In non-openstack environment it will be useful to be able to
manage real authentication. We can do that by laying in a
foundation for building authentication handlers which are
subclasses of the superclass introduced here. Loading those
plugins will come in a subsequent patch.

The superclasses proves itself in this change because
NoAuthMiddleware continues to work as designed.

Add a configurable delay to Nova Evacuate calls

In case /var/lib/nova/instances resides on NFS we have seen migrations
failing with 'Failed to get ""write"" lock - Is another process using the
image' errors.

This has been tracked down to grace/lease timeouts not having expired
before attempting the migration/evacuate, so in this cases it might be
desirable to delay the nova evacuate call to give the storage time to
release the locks.

To w/a that for Centos 7 CI in Train, always use MPM prefork, so there

If an aggregate fails to be created for some reason, for example because
the requested node is not in the freepool, some cleanup occurs. Part of
the cleanup is ensuring the target node is moved _back_ to the freepool.
This should theoretically ""heal"" cases where the node wasn't in the
freepool but also wasn't in some lease aggregate.

However, this call to Nova's API refers to the freepool aggregate by its
name, which is not supported here: the ID must be used[1]. This caused
this operation to fail and raise a NotFound, confusingly (because Nova
couldn't find an aggregate with ID='freepool' for example.)

Currently the dashboard and magnum clients are unable to get the default
quota of a project, if a project does not have a quota set. This is due
to the API returning a QuotaNotFound exception, rather than falling back
to the default quota.

The result is that dashboard is not displaying quotas correctly. It also
means users are not able to see their default quota.

This patch updates the API by returning the default quota instead of a
QuotaNotFound exception. This makes magnum behave similarly to how other
projects like designate handles quota.

This reverts commit 168ca7f0a474f1207ee01dab0ca2e70f34783e9c.

Removing postgresql support from devstack was unnecessary
since it's not broken and not causing maintenance issues
as far as I know. The commit being reverted said that pg
support was deprecated in Pike but nothing in the docs or
commit message refer to official deprecation of postgres
support in devstack or openstack in general. Not to mention
that there are still postgres-based jobs that will no
longer work *and* the notification to the mailing list about
doing this happened *after* it was already done [1] leaving
stakeholders with no time to reply.

Currently both nova evacuate and fence compute in the Instance HA
setup of tripleo user the keystone admin user in order to query nova,
evacuate instances, disable/enable the nova-compute service and
call the nova force-down API.

With this patch we introduce the keystone_tenant parameter which is
needed when moving to the nova service user as it is different than
keystone_admin in that case.

Tested as follows:
1. Deployed a normal unpatched OSP13 with IHA
2. Run a redeploy with the following addition:
parameter_defaults:
  ExtraConfig:
    tripleo::profile::base::pacemaker::instance_ha::keystone_password: ""%{hiera('nova::keystone::authtoken::password')}""
    tripleo::profile::base::pacemaker::instance_ha::keystone_admin: 'nova'
    tripleo::profile::base::pacemaker::instance_ha::keystone_tenant: 'service'
3. Observe the following:
3.1. Both the fence_compute and nova evacuate resources have updated attributes
3.2. IHA still works correctly

The 'local-data' in path /var/lib/os-collect-config/local-data should
be a directory, not a file. However, even if we can fix this, now
os-apply-config will merge configs based on the order [ec2, heat and
local], but actually there is no deployments collected local. Then
unfortunately, the deployments collected from Heat will be
overwriten because the merging order in os-apply-config. At this
moment, we can't change os-apply-config since it's deliberate.
So the only reasonable way we can do now is using
/var/lib/heat-cfntools/cfn-init-data and /var/lib/cloud/data/cfn-init-data.

Previously, we'd preserve the sysmeta that we wrote down with the
original multipart-upload to track its S3-style etag on the new part,
causing it to have an ETag like `<MD5>-<N>`. Later, when the client
tried to complete the new multipart-upload, it would send that etag back
to the server, which would reject the request because the ETag didn't
look like a normal MD5.

Now, have s3api include blank values in the copy request to overwrite
the source sysmeta, and treat a blank etag override the same as a
missing one.

A recent patch fix for the Rocky branch from
commit 20fd02611674da5365e93d06f330d1f76fd71e3e have introduced an
AttributeError on Third Party Plugins that does not implement
certain extensions.

This is just related to FWaaSv1 and only applicable to Rocky and below
releases.

This change fixes an issue where in the course of sending firewall
update notifications to the appropriate agents an AttributeError
is encountered due to unsafe assumption of the availability of L3
extensions on the l3_plugin.

This change puts protections in place to avoid this issue.

When a firewall is created after the routers have been deployed,
we are supposed to manually do a firewall-update on specific routers
where we wanted the firewall policy to be applied in the case of
FWaaS-v1.
But in the case of DVR routers, we have seen the firewall-update
for routers that are deployed in the compute hosts are not getting
propagated properly.
The reason is the firewall update, firewall delete and firewall
create events are not notified to all the respective router hosts.
The original code only handles getting the host information from
the routers that are scheduled to the l3 agent, but in the case of
DVR routers, the routers are only scheduled to the network node l3
agents and the other distributed routers on compute are created
based on the service port binding.

This bug is applicable only for FWaaS-v1 and the patch should be
applied for Rocky release and below, since FWaaS-v1 is not supported
in Stein and Train release.

This patch fixes the problem described above by taking care of
collecting all the hosts involved with DVR routers and notifying
them.

to list shares using the `--limit` option.
This change was tested in a very busy environment with 800 shares.
Before the change, the operation took about 25 seconds to be
finished. Now, the operation takes about 3 seconds in the same
environment.

The contract for ReplConnection.replicate() is that if we can get a
response, we return it, and if we can't (because of a timeout, or a
socket error, or some other http_client error like BadStatusLine), we
return None to indicate the error.

Previously, _fetch_and_merge_shard_ranges() always assumed the
response would have a `status` attribute and raise an AttributeError
when response was None. Now it will treat that case like other
get_shard_range failures.

Add a configurable delay to Nova Evacuate calls

In case /var/lib/nova/instances resides on NFS we have seen migrations
failing with 'Failed to get ""write"" lock - Is another process using the
image' errors.

This has been tracked down to grace/lease timeouts not having expired
before attempting the migration/evacuate, so in this cases it might be
desirable to delay the nova evacuate call to give the storage time to
release the locks.

It is only necessary to pass subtransactions=True to session.begin()
when the new transactions may be called from inside an existing
transaction. There is *no* need to pass it from the top level
transaction in anticipation that there may be subtransactions. The
sqlalchemy docs are not 100% clear on this so we were doing both to be
sure to be sure, but we have confirmed that the latter is not required.

Since passing subtransactions=True when it is not required may cover up
other problems, remove it except in those cases where we know the API
may be called as a subtransaction.

The neutron_pg_drop Porg Group is created with some ACLs to drop
all the traffic by default. This group doesn't match any Neutron
resource and it's created once the first Neutron port with
port_security enabled gets created.

A race condition exists whn the first two ports get created
simultaneously by different works as both may attempt to create
this Port Group. The result is that one of the port creations will
fail. Setting may_exist=True should avoid this race
