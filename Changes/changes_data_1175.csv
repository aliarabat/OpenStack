Python 3 introduced a next() function to replace the next() method on
iterator objects. Rather than calling the method on the iterator, the next()
function is called with the iterable object as it's sole parameter, which
calls the underlying __next__() method.

The next() function was backported to Python 2.6 which allows us to use either
the 2.x or 3.x way simultaneously.

Ironic Conductor Manager now waits on its greenpool workers to finish
before del_host completes. This will ensure more-correct behavior, as
well as giving workers the opportunity to release locks before the
RPCService stops. Added a manager test to confirm del_host waits on the
manager's greenpool.

This modifies RPCService in two important ways:

1) The order of shutdown operations in RPCService.stop is changed to be
more correct. First, the server is stopped to prevent new requests from
arriving. Second, the manager is instructed to inform the cluster that
this conductor is shutting down. Finally, the conductor service stop()
method is called with graceful set to True to allow any tasks the
service currently has running to finish normally.

This is in contrast to the previous order of operations where the
service was told to immediately stop before stopping the server. This
could allow requests to arrive while the service has already stopped,
which is not ideal. Additionally, Service.stop was called in a way
which caused existing/running service tasks to immediately exit, which
could result in bad node or database state, necessitating manual
operator intervention.

2) The underlying Service object is told to shutdown gracefully, which
will allow tasks to complete before RPCService completely shuts down.

This has a negative test which tries to create a server with a number of
metadata items that exceed the quota limits but it intermittently
failing because the server gets created successfully (returns the 202).

This is most likely due to the quota class test which is making the
default quotas unlimited when it runs so we can hit a window where this
negative test will fail.

Anything compute tests in tempest which relies on quota checks for test
results should be using the compute_quotas lock fixture, so add that
here.

When this fails it's just a MismatchError in the logs so it's hard to
fingerprint this kind of race failure in logstash, especially since the
name of the test server is just 'test'.

Change to use the create_test_server method from the base class so the
instance name has the class name in it which would make this easier to
fingerprint in the result of an intermittent failure.

This is doubly useful since if this fails we're leaking a server
resource. By using create_test_server, if the assertion fails then at
least the base class is tracking the server created and will delete it
on tear down.

Casting exceptions using str() or unicode() can interfere
with the proper translation of the exception message.  This is
especially true when lazy translation is enabled, since it causes
the exception message to be translated immediately using the
the default locale.

The use of str() on a message with lazy translation enabled will also
cause a failure.

from Nova which flags these cases.

This patch does two things to improve this test, and
help debug issues with it failing.

- Add additional checks for contents of the first two
  expected notifications.
- Assert the length of the notifications list after checking
  its contents so that if it contains unexpected items, we can
  see what they are.  This should help with the current gate
  failures.

This fix raises an IpAddressInUse exception when subnet gateway IP is assigned

For a neutron network that is connected to a hardware router, its subnet
gateway IP address is not associated with a neutron port. But neutron allows
user to set this gateway IP as a loadbalancer VIP.  When both the router and LB
VIP uses the same IP address, traffic to and from the subnet may not reach its

Modify Rally docs (for readthedocs), sticking to the following principles:
* Make the docs structure as simple as possible:
    1. Overview
    2. Install Rally
    3. Rally step-by-step
    4. User stories
    5. Plugins
    6. Contribute to Rally
    7. Rally OS Gates
    8. Request a New Feature
    9. Project Info
* Keep in mind what questions different target groups usually have about Rally.
  The new structure relates to these groups as follows:
    1 -> Managers
    2, 3, 4 -> QA
    5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -> QA & Developers
* Make each docs page to be easy to get through;
* Prefer pictures over text;
* Use hyperlinks to easily navigate from page to page;
* Fix incorrect English & typos.

Also add a sample for SLA plugins.

When fetches an image from Glance, LibvirtDriver creates a

It is not deleted automatically even if the image is delete

If the response obtained by the client in the functional tests was not
successful, the de-serialization into a model object will throw an
exception, since the response doesn't contain a JSON string that could
be used for creating such an object; It will contain the error code
and a relevant error message. This fixes that and also adds a little
bit more logging when de-serializing objects.

The reason for adding this is that, even though the exceptions that
this threw were caught at some point, it only generated unnecessary
noise in the logs.

Currently several IPA error classes inherit from Exception. This
patch makes the base class of those classes RESTError. These
error classes are also restructured to initialize in the same
manner as other classes which inherit from RESTError. Additionally
test cases are added for these error classes.

This fixes and cleans up (making it consistent) how error
instances set their details value. The base class RESTError
will set the details value; all subclasses should call their
parent's __init__().

Unit tests were added to test that the Error instances are
initialized correctly.

Having a Rakefile will allow us to change the actual test commands on
our side rather than relying on changes to the openstack-infra
repository. This should make it a lot faster to change things, but also
easier to test since the jenkins jobs are actually run in this
repository, not the openstack-infra one.

This commit defines the jobs we previously had defined in Jenkins and
uses 'high-level' naming consistently (i.e. lint, style vs. foodcritic,
rubocop).

There is also a :clean task to help with deleting the files generated by
the other jobs.

Also changed foodcritic to run on the source cookbook rather than the
one installed by berks, see
e.g. https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf/issues/931#issuecomment-29668369

This is the third in a series of changes to move to using
the new oslo_<library> namespace that is being used for
oslo libraries.

There is currently a shim in place that is allowing the old
oslo.<library> imports to work, but we need to be prepared for
when the shims go away.  Thus, we need patches like this one to
move to the new namespace.

This patch also updates our hacking check to ensure that no instances
of oslo.config sneak back in.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, SUBMITTED EARLY FOR
DESIGN DISCUSSION AND REFERENCE. DO NOT MERGE.

This is a forward-looking set of changes adding
a set of commands for manipulating applications without
requiring a user to really need to understand the trappings
of plans, assemblies, and the other resources.

The eventual goal is to deprecate the other commands in the CLI
(not the client!) to streamline the Solum command-line experience.

This is at present a WIP because a number of these details
are difficult if not impossible to accomplish with Solum's API
for now. For example, invoking just a build or just a deployment of an
assembly, or maintaining any kind of build history for applications.

Help messages are now hand-crafted instead of
being generated by the CommandBase class. On
error, the client should return a relevant help
message about the subcommand tree, and also any
applicable error messages raised.

ArgumentParser has been subclassed to control both
the help messages and also more completely rein in
the sys.exit() behavior it is prone to.

To cut down on the size of solum.py, the command
classes have been moved to their own subdirectory.

* the correct switch to ask for the grub-install version is --version,
  -v has a totally different meaning (--verbose). Older versions of
  grub-install recognize the --version switch too.
* grub-install from GRUB 2.x is a binary, not a shell script, and it might
  require the shared libraries which are available inside the chroot only
  (and not in the bootstrap system). Therefore grub-install should be run
  in the chroot even if we are asking for its version.

This commit breaks distros that do not have proliantutils
packages. This is because Ironic is written to be fail
fast with regards to driver dependencies. Any driver
that is listed in the config file must have its dependencies
present.

We should not require all distros to carry these packages.
Rather we should implement a pluggable sub-element that
can be used only on distributions which support this
driver.

  * usage of rally.benchmark.wrappers.network, so networking implementation
    details are behind the scenes now and scenario code is simplier
  * scenario args `fixed_network' and `use_floating_ip' are removed
    because they make sense only for devstack where fixed network
    is available, so that is absolutely unusable on any real OpenStack

On a loopback device (e.g., when proxy-server and object-server are on

effect of Nagel interacting with the loopback MTU of 64K.

This effect has been directly seen by Mark Seger and Rick Jones on a
proxy-server to object-server PUT. However, you could expect to see a
similar effect on replication via ssync if the object being replicated
is on a different drive on the same node.

A prior change [1] related to Nagel set TCP_NODELAY on responses. This change
sets it on all outgoing connections.

It uses $EXTRA_ROUTE as the l-value; but since $EXTRA_ROUTE is never
previously set anywhere (as far as I can tell) I believe this is meant
to read EXTRA_ROUTE

Additionally, the '}' at the end of the quoted json was escaped, but the

This subclasses KSC's generic Password plugin to allow version discovery with
default Keystone configurations that leave admin_endpoint and public_endpoint
at the default values (http://localhost:xxxx).  This patch copies the scheme
and netloc from the original auth_url into the URL returned from version
discovery if the returned netloc begins with 'localhost'.

Due to the specific nature of this review, the Keystone team is not
inclned to include it in keystoneclient so it is addressed here.

The eqlx driver would identify one CLI command completion by looking
for the system name prompt in the output (""ARRAY_NAME>""). But some
cases where there is no ""ARRAY_NAME>"" in the output. The eqlx server
closes the ssh connection immediately after sends such message, which
lead to a infinite loop in _get_output() and 100% CPU utilization.

What the patch does is to check the return of chan.recv(), if the
length of returned string is zero, which means server has closed the
connection, the loop will be exited.

This is an attempt to fix bug #1394095 which reported that alarm_url can
be signaled only in a blocked way. The reason is that the resource_signal
API was a synchronous call. To avoid breakng CFN/OpenStack WaitCondition
behavior, a new 'sync_call' argument is added which default to False.

A not-so-related fix to test_engine_service.py (L2161-2163) was included
in this patch because without that fix, I was not able to pass the test
cases. It was so trivial, so I don't think it deserves a separate patch.

Until now, when an instance is rescheduled due to a failed
spawn the existing network structure that has been set up
can be used from a subsequent host because it it not host
specific. The only exception to this was when using the
Ironic. Now DVR has been introduced in neutron, network
ports are bound to a specific host. As a result any created
ports will be bound to the wrong host when an instance is
rescheduled and the new instance will not be connected to
its networks.

One solution is to add code that updates the port binding
in the spawn of a rescheduled instance, but that is as
complex as creating them in the first place.

As an alternative, this patch adds a method to the network
api called deallocate_on_reschedule(). This returns False
by default but is over ridden in the neutron api to return
True if the port binding extension is in use. This is used
to trigger network cleanup on reschule as is currently done
for the virt driver to cater for Ironic.

This alternative avoids unecessary complexity and keeps the
existing behavior for other network implementations.

Dashboard is built on top of Horizon, but does not state Horizon
as a requirement in requirements.txt. Instead it is done right
in the tox.ini file. In most of the production cases when Dashboard
is installed as plugin for the OpenStack Dashboard Horizon is already
installed therefore we need this requirement only for development
purposes.

Horizon is referenced as a link to tarball in tox.ini, but in stable/juno
branch wrong link was referenced, horizon-master.tar.gz instead of
horizon-2014.2.tar.gz.

Correct version for Horizon in the next release of Dashboard from stable/juno
is horizon-2014.2.1.tar.gz

We have customized ceilometer publisher to send metrics into openTSDB service.
Hence, we need more user-friendly VM information (e.g. VM hostname, IP
and project_cos) as metrics tags during populate metrics into openTSDB.

So we expected samples can attach nova meta data at publisher.PublisherBase's
publish_samples function. Then it's available for customized publisher
to access metadata.

However the current method add_reserved_user_metadata can't support various
naming convention which didn't have one particular prefix. So we need to
add one more config for metadata keys ""reserved_metadata_keys"" in
ceilometer.conf, and user can define the key name they cared in
instance.metadata.

Since DracClient is a wrapper for pywsman.Client, it makes sense to add
ability to construct the pywsman.ClientOptions based on a dictionary of

This is also necessary because pywsman.Client#invoke can't handle
constructing the request properly when a list is passed as a property.
In cases like this, a pywsman.XmlDoc instance need to created manually

iSCSI volume kills all iSCSI volumes visible from the nova compute node.
When we use different targets(IQNs) associated with same portal for
each different multipath device, all of the targets will be deleted
via disconnect_volume().

This patch fixes the behavior of detaching volume:

  1. Extract the targets for the detached multipath device.
  2. Delete/disconnect the targets for the detached multipath device.

In Icehouse with ""iscsi_use_multipath=true"", attaching a multipath
iSCSI volume may create unnecessary iSCSI sessions.

The iscsiadm discovery command in connect_volume() returns all of the
targets in the Cinder node, not just the ones related to the multipath
volume which is specified by iqn. If the storage has many targets,
connecting to all these volumes will also result in many unnecessary
connections.

There are two types of iSCSI multipath devices. One which shares
the same iqn between multiple portals, and the other which use
different iqns on different portals. connect_volume() needs to
identify the type by checking iscsiadm the output if the iqn is
used by multiple portals.

This patch changes the behavior of attaching volume:

   1. Identify the type by checking the iscsiadm output.
   2. Connect to the correct targets by connect_to_iscsi_portal().

created with the right permission/ownership.  Lastly, we set some valid

happening with recurse=yes as the directory gets created in another

This patch removes the logic for creating chained local switches in
the NSX backend for Neutron networks with flat or vlan bindings.
Switch chaining as a feature is no more useful since the underlying
backend limitation has been long removed.

The logic for reading chained logical switches is however
preserved by this patch, since some older neutron networks could
still be mapped to chained logical switches.

This spec proposes the following enhancements to the Consistency Groups
support:

* Create CG from CG snapshot
  * Add an API that allows a user to create a Consistency Group from a
    Cgsnapshot.
  * Add a Volume Driver API accordingly.

* Modify Consistency Group
  * Add an API that adds existing volumes to CG and removing volumes from CG
    after it is created.
  * Add a Volume Driver API accordingly.

* Create a New cg_volumetypes Table
  * This new table will be used to store volume types in a CG. This is
    to overcome the limitation of the current solution which stores all
    volume type uuids in one column of the CG table.
  * This new table will contain 3 columns:
    * uuid of a cg_volumetype entry
    * uuid of a consistencygroup
    * uuid of a volume type

When we schedule a router to an agent that has already been
scheduled to with that same router we do not indicate an error.
The method 'check_agent_router_scheduling_needed' simply
returns 'False' as opposed to raising a 'RouterHostedByL3Agent'
exception. This doesn't translate into an HTTP error (409)
so there is no indication of problem.

Note that his behaviour is the same for HA and legacy routers.

The solution is to simply raise 'RouterHostedByL3Agent' which
propagates and causes the server to reply with an
'409 Conflict' error.
This solution is matches the behaviour found when trying
to un-schedule a router from the same agent.

There are two driver modes currently, multi_svm_mode
and single_svm_mode.

""multi_svm_mode"" means usage of share-networks that contain
network info for dynamic creation of share-servers (SVMs).
""single_svm_mode"" means usage of predefined some endpoint,
without need to provide share-network and without creation
of share-servers (SVMs).

User might easily get wrong ideas about these driver modes based
on their names. ""multi_svm_mode"" sounds like more than one
share-servers are needed, and ""single_svm_mode"" indicate only one
share-server is enough.

We'd like to rename driver mode names:
  - multi_svm_mode    =>  dynamic_svm_mode
  - single_svm_mode   =>  no_svm_mode

The eqlx driver would identify one CLI command completion by looking
for the system name prompt in the output (""ARRAY_NAME>""). But some
cases where there is no ""ARRAY_NAME>"" in the output. The eqlx server
closes the ssh connection immediately after sends such message, which
lead to a infinite loop in _get_output() and 100% CPU utilization.

What the patch does is to check the return of chan.recv(), if the
length of returned string is zero, which means server has closed the
connection, the loop will be exited.

  commit 02db94dc33d72182201fd78651e5e5e82ab411c2
  Author: Justin Santa Barbara <justin@fathomdb.com>
  Date:   Wed Mar 23 01:22:11 2011 -0700

    Earlier versions of the python libvirt binding had getVersion
    in the libvirt namespace, not on the connection object.  Check
    both.

This commit was very confused & wrong. All libvirt versions have
provided a 'getVersion' method against *both* the 'libvirt'
package namespace and the libvirt.virConnect object namespace,
serving different purposes. The former gets the local library
version while the latter gets the remote daemon version. Neither
function has ever moved namespace.

This is the start of the API to support the angular front end.

It is missing endpoints not immediately used by angular WIPs other
than the identity re-work, but is enough to start with.

Changes:
- handle additional HTTP status code attribute
- move common helpers from test modules to here

Partially Implements: blueprint angularize-identity-tables

If instance exposes any CPU pinning information, it will be taken into
consideration when calculating NUMA cell usage of the host.

We also add some convenience methods to NUMACell object for pinning and
unpinning CPUs, that will raise an error if the data is inconsistent,
and a wrapper for checking weather CPU pinning was actually requested
(to avoid an error prone 'is not None' in places where the check is
needed).

PEP-0274 introduced dict comprehensions to replace dict constructor
with a sequence of length-2 sequences, these are benefits copied
from [1]:
  The dictionary constructor approach has two distinct disadvantages
  from the proposed syntax though.  First, it isn't as legible as a
  dict comprehension.  Second, it forces the programmer to create an
  in-core list object first, which could be expensive.
Nova dropped python 2.6 support, we can leverage this now.
There is deep dive about PEP-0274[2] and basic tests about
performance[3].
Note: This commit doesn't handle dict constructor with kwagrs.
This commit also adds a hacking rule.
