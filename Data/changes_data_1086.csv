This patch works around a broken Fedora python-cryptography
and python-ipaddress package issue which crept in this week
due to the fact that python-ipaddr and python-ipaddress
conflict with each other. This prevents python-cryptography
from installing cleanly when installed alongside other
openstack services which require python-ipaddr.

Since the QoS extension for plugins is handles by this class, it makes
sense for it to handle also property extension of resources.

For ML2 this means that that extend_{network,port}_dict functions will
handle the extension of resources by calling QosExtensionHandler.
This logic can easily be reused by other plugins.

Contexts:
* context module was renamed to contexts
* convention property is now part of ContextBase class.
* Standard Context implementation automatically uses convention
  from parent context
* Context interface was enhanced to add capability to check key presence,
   get data with different default or not try to access parent context
* MultiContext to virtually merge several contexts without of making them related.
  All merged contexts may have parents of their own which are also merged.
  Source contexts are not modified. This is sort of context mix-in

Parser:
* keyword arguments (name => value) now require name to be keyword token.
   So f('abc' => value) will not work. This doesnt affect dict() and similar functions
   as they use different argument format.
* tokens that start with two underscores (__) are no more valid. This is done so that it
  would be possible to have auto-injected Python arguments like ""__context"" without
  affecting possible kwargs of the same function
* ""__context"" and ""__engine"" parameters where not explicitly declared treated the
  same way as  ""context"" and ""engine""

Delegates:
* Added ability to call delegate (callable) passed as a context value.
  The syntax is $var(args) (or even $(args)).
* Delegate doesn't have to be a context value but also can be result of expression:
  func(args1)(args2), (f() op g())() and so on
* Delegates are disabled by default for security reasons. ""allow_delegates"" parameter
  was added to both YaqlFactory classes to enable them
* (expr)(args) will be translated to #call(expr, args). So for this to work #call function
  must be present in context. Standard context doesn't provide this function by default.
  Use delegates=True parameter of create_context method (including legacy mode version)
  to register #call() and lambda() functions
* additional lambda(expression) method that returns delegate to passed expression thus
  making it 2nd order lambda. This delegate may be stored in context using let() method
  (or alternatives) or be called as usual. lambda(expression)(args) is equal to expression(args)

 Function specs:
 * FunctionDefinition now has ""meta"" dictionary to store arbitrary extended metadata for the
   function (for example version etc.)
* use @specs.meta('key', 'value') decorator to assign meta value to the function. Several
  decorators may be applied to single function
* Context.__call__() / runner.call() now accept optional function_filter parameter that is a
  predicate (functionDefinition, context -> boolean) to additionally filter function candidates
  based on context values, function metadata and so on.
* returns_context decorator and functionality was removed because it was shawn to be useless

Smart types:
* ""context"" argument was added to each check() method so that it would be possible to do
  checks using context values. Non of standard smart-types use it, however custom types may do.
* return_context flag was removed from Lambda/Delegate/Super types for the same reasons as in FD
* GenericType helper class was added as a base class for custom non-lazy smart-types simplifying
  their development
* added ability to pass received Lambda (Delegate etc) to another method (or base method version)
  when the later expects it in another format (for example seneder had Lambda() while the receiver
  had Lambda(with_context=True))

Standard library:
* ""#operator_."" method for obj.method() now expects first argument (sender expression) to be object
   (pre-evaluated) rather than Lambda. This doesn't brake anything but allows to override this function
   in child contexts for some more specific types of sender without getting resolution error because of
   several versions of the same function being differ by parameter laziness

Also bumps requirements to latest OpenStack global-requirements and sets version to 1.0.0b4

When we migrate an unattached volume using generic volume
migration, volume export remains at the destination host
after volume migration even if we succeed the volume
migration.

This problem happens when the destination backend uses
LVM driver.
Unnecessary volume export should be deleted after volume
migration.

The bugs in launchpad get sometimes in an inconsistent state. For
example there are bugs which have an assignee, but are set to 'New'.
Right now it's part of the bug triage (see task 3 at [1]) for every
project to solve those inconsistencies. This can be done automatized.
This patch set adds a script which does the cleanup automatically.

For example, to set all 'New' bugs in 'Nova' which have an assignee
to 'In Progress', the script has to be executed like this:

    python bug_cleanup.py nova --newbugs

By doing it this way it is also more ""set in stone"" how a consistent
bug should look like.

Network and distributed filesystems are a useful means of sharing files among
a distributed architecture. This core use case makes them an excellent
candidate for storage of job binaries.

While internal database storage and Swift storage are sensible options for
binary storage, the addition of Manila integration allows it as a third option
for job binary storage and retrieval. This specification details how this
will be implemented.

A recent change to MetricsAggregator (195214) broke hostnames when
passed as parameters to gauge().  This affected libvirt client metrics,
which alter the hostname in this manner.  To set the hostname in a way
compatible with 195214, I now delete the 'hostname' dimension for client
metrics, which was unused, anyway.

In addition, I moved the setting of dimensions to above the first
gauge() call so that all metrics are submitted with the correct
dimensions.  To prevent a regression in change 199323, I've wrapped
the dimension setup within a try/except block.

A recent change (set_lpar_uuid) enabled the code to tell the PowerVM API
to use the UUID that matches the Nova instance uuid upon VM creation.
This means that there is a 1 to 1 mapping between the UUIDs in OpenStack
and the PowerVM API.

Therefore, the UUID cache served little (or no) value.  This change set

The first option is executor_thread_pool_size.

This option was called rpc_thread_pool_size, but because it's used by
notification and rpc 'executor_thread_pool_size' looks a better name.

Changing executor_thread_pool_size default will be useful for ceilometer
the default of 64 is really to small to consume many notifications at
once for batching them. When is clearly sufficient for rpc stuffs.

Add a retry scheduler server process to the DevStack start/stop

script for the retry scheduler process, as other projects such as
Glance and Nova are doing now. Eventually we'll want to move over all
our boot scripts to the entry point approach. Verify functional test
for generating a simple certificate order, which is the first of the
extended-workflow order types that utilize the retry processing logic.
Also add try/catch around the retry process because if we don't pass
back a retry interval to the Oslo periodic task framework, it stops
rescheduling tasks! Also added delays to the functional test order
status check as for SQLite I was noticing disk I/O concurrency errors
otherwise. Yes, I'd still like to support SQLite for local functional
testing.

This patch adds a swift_rings_check.py script which will confirm that
the contents file and ring_builder files match post ring_sync to the
cluster.

In some cases, particularly with a multi-region swift cluster, it may be
possible for 2 simultaneous runs (from different regions as an example)
to clobber changes that were made to the ring. This script and check
will confirm that the ring matches the devices that are expected to be
there in the inventory/contents file.

The _get_possible_cpu_topologies() method is intended to return
a list of CPU topologies that honour the constraints set by the
cpu_max_sockets, cpu_max_cores & cpu_max_threads image/flavour
properties. In

  commit 770ab8eeb72b184ac6164aeabb89c4bf45f938a9
  Author: Nikola Dipanov <ndipanov@redhat.com>
  Date:   Mon Dec 8 14:45:48 2014 +0100

    Make get_best_cpu_topology consider NUMA requested CPU topology

the code was changed so that the desired thread count from the
NUMA topology was passed in. Unfortunately the logic implemented
was flawed because it while the cpu_threads preferred threads
count was honour, it would not honour the cpu_max_threads
value.

So if you have

  vcpus=4
  hw_cpu_threads = 2
  NUMA threads == 4

It would return CPU topologies with 2 threads, but if you had

  vcpus=4
  hw_cpu_max_threads = 2
  NUMA threads == 4

then it would return CPU topologies with 4 threads, which
violates the users request.

If you had a vcpu count not a multiple of the NUMA threads

  vcpus=6
  NUMA threads = 4

then it would be incapable of determining any topology
as it only looked for exact matching threads and 4 does
not divide into 6.

The _threads_requested_by_user() method has a typo in it
causing it to look for whether 'cpu_maxthreads' exists,
but correcting that to 'cpu_max_threads' does not do
anything to fix the actual behaviour, as the max threads
value is never acted upon.

If we clamped the 'min_requested_threads' value calculated
in _get_desirable_cpu_topologies() to cpu_max_threads, the
code still doesn't work, as the max threads count may not
actually be a multiple of the vCPU count. We need to
consider which topologies have a threads count that is
closest to the desired NUMA threads, but not exceeding
the max threads count.

To solve this properly we revert the changes to the
_get_possible_cpu_topologies() method, so that it only
ever considers the user provided max sockets/cores/threads
value from the image/flavour as it originally did.

We then introduce a _filter_for_numa_threads() method
which filters the list of possible topologies, to those
which most closely match the desired number of threads
from the NUMA topology.

Finally we do the sorting based on the preferred
topologies defined by the cpu_sockets/cores/threads
image/flavour properties

and then when we update server server.properties already contains last

Use /var/lib/fuel/ibp as the image build directory. This directory
will be backed by a volume in the mcollective container which reduces
IO overhead and makes image build time reasonable.

fuel_agent (which builds Ubuntu images) runs in the mcollective
container. A container filesystem is backed by dm-snapshot which
is known to have a poor write performance, especially for large
files (like OS images). By default docker storage is a loopback file
residing in /var/lib/docker. Thus the data written to the OS image
being built goes through a number of layers:

ext4 -> loop -> dm-snapshot (/var/lib/docker-> loop ->
     -> ext4 (/var/lib/docker) -> dm-linear (os-varlibdocker) ->
     -> hard drive

If the master node runs on a VM rather than a physcial hardware
the above chain gets even more complicated:

ext4 -> loop -> dm-snapshot (/var/lib/docker-> loop ->
     -> ext4 (/var/lib/docker) -> dm-linear (os-varlibdocker) ->
     -> virtual hard drive (qemu) -> qcow2 -> ext4 (host)

Using the volume makes it possible to eliminate the extra layers,
so the written data goes through

ext4 -> loop -> ext4 -> dm-linear (os-var) -> hard drive

Note: this patch can be merged before the ones which actually make
/var/lib/fuel/ibp a host volume (obviously there won't be any
performance gain until fuel-library/fuel-main bits get merged).

This patch implements the database model required for the network
RBAC work. In addition it migrates the current network and subnet
'shared' attributes to leverage the new table.

'shared' is no longer a property of the DB model because its status
is based on the tenant ID of the API caller. From an API perspective
this is the same (tenants will see networks as 'shared=True' if the
network is shared with them). However, internal callers (e.g. plugins,
drivers, services) will not be able to check for the 'shared' attribute
on network and subnet db objects any more.

This patch just achieves parity with the current shared behavior so it
doesn't add the ability to manipulate the RBAC entries directly. The
RBAC API is in the following patch.

During granular deployment development there
was an architecture where we wanted to use
additional layer to execute tasks on OpenStack
nodes, then it was decided not to add complexity
and use just MCollective instead.

Also all validation logic was moved into separate
repository:
https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-tasks-validator

Themers need an easy way to maninpulate existing templates.  Django
provides a very easy method for custom overloads via prepending a
Theme located template directory to the existing TEMPLATE_DIRS tuple
located in the settings.py.  The new template directory needs to
maintain the same directory structure as the overridden templates.

Also, the entire theme directory was being served out at /static/custom,
but it is not needed to statically serve up the Django templates.
This new functionality now supports having more granular control
over what is statically served from /static/custom by specifying a
'static' subfolder within your theme.  If no sub folder is found, then
the legacy functionality is the fall back, and the entire folder is served.

Since the Blue theme was provided as a way to showcase the extensibility
of Horizon themes, I have provided an examle of what a template override
would look like and how it would be used.  The Blue theme now includes an
entirely Bootstrap Compliant top navbar experience that is responsive, but
without losing any of the underlying Django functionality, values or
translations.

When we have multiple plugins, we call downgrade on each one of them,
however, if the we have reached the specific revision we wanted, we
should not continue to call the rest of the plugins, In this fix,
we check the revision number and break out of the loop when we detect
this condition and prevent errors

Before there was no way to upgrade to a specific revision, because the
revision passed to the manager was passed to all the plugins, some of
which failed to process it.

Add a new method to every plugin `has_revision`, which returns
whether the plugin has the revision. Use it in upgrade and
downgrade.

Currently the neutron-vpnaas repo uses the integrated-gate-neutron
template. This template includes the gate-grenade-dsvm-neutron job
in the check queue. Right now the grenade job for this repo does
not build. The original intention for adding the grenade job to
this repo was to have the job in the experimental queue.

This patch removes the use of the integrated-gate-neutron
template from the neutron-vpnaas repo. It adds all the jobs used
in the template back to the repo in the pipelines used in the
template with the exception of the gate-grenade-dsvm-neutron job
which is now in the experimental pipeline.

This patch is about a revision to the webhook implementation, major
changes include:

- allow credential to be omitted, where the assumption is that the
  requester's trust data can be used as an alternative, or the object
  owner's trust data can be used, if the requester is an admin.
- change the 'credential' field of webhook to be a text, so that the
  whole field will be encrpted/decrypted; with this change, we can
  accommodate more flexible credential formats.
- simplified webhook test cases so now the most time consuming unit test
  cases are all about encryption/decryption.

psutil 2.x and above has a lot of API changes as described in:
https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/blob/master/HISTORY.rst

So we should work correctly with both old and new psutil versions
by using a version check and use the correct method/attributes.

Note that we cannot remove the g-r cap until all the projects have
switched to oslo.reports (OR we fix oslo-incubator GMR code and have
sync'ed all the consuming projects). So this review is the first
step in a long process of switching all consumers of GMR to use
what we have in oslo.reports.

This patch revised the implementation of user id retrieval. Keystone
doesn't allow a non-admin user to perform 'users:list' operation. To
check the user id, we now check the access info from authentication
outputs.

Another problem fixed is related to trust retrieval. The 'trusts:list'
implementation in Keystone is bad. When 'trustor_user_id' is provided,
Keystone checks if the trustor_user_id is the caller; when
'trustee_user_id' is provided, Keystone checks if the trustee_user_id is
the caller. When both arguments are provided, Keystone checks if both
the trustor and the trustee is the caller, this makes no sense.

WIP
Needs tests.
Needs devref.
/WIP

Adding results to callbacks so that callbacks can send a reply on which
the calling party can act accordigly.

As an example, the ML2 plugin was modified so that when sending a
notification after a port update it will know if the callback indeed
acted upon it and if so will further notify the agents.

The end goal is to decouple the extension code from the plugin so that
the plugin can send the callback, the extension will handle it as it
sees fit, and the plugin can act upon the callback's result without
being tightly coupled with the implementation details of what the
callback actually did.

Commit a55ea8c92914d78ad63aca393dc4c70539c227a9 introduced a relationship
for Instance 1.18 to send PciDevice 1.2. That is problematic for people
doing commit-to-commit deployment of stable/kilo because upgrading your
conductor nodes before your computes will send back an unsupported
version 1.2. Just landing the version bump now means that all nodes will
tolerate a newer object, but conductors won't send it.

This change is not on master (because it doesn't make sense there).

This is a significant piece of work.

It enables neutron objects to define fields that are lazily loaded on
field access. To achieve that,

- field should be mentioned in cls.synthetic_fields
- obj_load_attr should be extended to lazily fetch and cache the field

Based on this work, we define per type rule fields that are lists of
appropriate neutron objects. (At the moment, we have only single type
supported, but I tried hard to make it easily extendable, with little or
no coding needed when a new rule type object definition is added to
rule.py: for example, we inspect object definitions based on
VALID_RULE_TYPES, and define appropriate fields for the policy object).

To implement lazy loading for those fields, I redefined get_by_id for
rules that now meld fields from both base and subtype db models into the
corresponding neutron object.

Added a simple test that checks bandwidth_rules attribute behaves for
policies.

Some objects unit test framework rework was needed to accomodate
synthetic fields that are not propagated to db layer.

changing the name of the parameter. When the environment file is then

Because the ""official"" .NET SDK has very limited functions to call

features to support all the steps though, it will be a good start to

This patch implements update_migrated_volume for LVM, Storwize
and updates Dell, StorPool and Infortrend drivers accordingly. It
makes sure that after a successful volume migration, the cinder
volume name(id) is the same as the backend volume name(id). Other
back-end drivers can take this patch as a reference to implement
update_migrated_volume.

PS: Not applicable to multi-attached volumes, since we need to wait
until the multi-attach lands in Nova.

This patch also adds a unit test for the StorPool driver's
update_migrated_volume() implementation.

        Add numa_node to PCIDevice

        The change extends the PCI device model and its DB representation.
        Query libvirt for the PCI devices numa node.

This patch adds the necessary changes to master. We only bump the
PciDeviceList version, and add a backporting rule to obj_relationship
dictionary of the Instance object, to start sending the new version with
1.18 version of the instance (we are currently on 1.21)

The master patch fixes versioning going forward, and all interactions
that request the PciDeviceList through the Instance object, however
applying this stable/kilo backport is required for Kilo nodes to
start requesting the latest version of PciDevice through PciDeviceList.

As of Kilo, Glance returns a list of locations associated with an
image, but the NetApp cDOT driver only operated on the first one.
In addition, Glance has started enforcing a schema on the metadata
that can be added to images stored in the file glance_store. This
change modifies the cDOT driver to iterate through the list of
locations, using the correct schema-compliant fields, and uses the
first one with a valid IP address for our backend for optimizing
the copy of images into Cinder volumes.

discards the broken connection, without returning a new one

leak and eventually blocks the thread.

It is fixed by returning a new connection into the pool.

Currently Neutron does not validate the version of Keepalived.
In order to support configuring IPv6 default route, the minimum
version [1] of keepalived that is required is 1.2.10
This patch validates the required support in keepalived.

Although keepalived changelog mentions that IPv6 virtual_routes and
static_routes are supported in version 1.2.8, it is seen that in
v1.2.8 IPv6 default route is not supported. Support for default route
is added in keepalived v1.2.10. Observations on v1.2.8 are captured
at the following link - http://paste.openstack.org/show/165403/

This change has shown to improve general performance and system stability.
Ubuntu 14.04 has some systemD bits within it and there are a few items that can
be tuned. These changes add some additional in container tuning the ensure that
the pseudo systemD availability within our containers is not impeding container
performance. Additionally the netfilter for bridged interfaces was set to 0 which
should also improve bridge performance in general.

different formats (legacy and bdm v2). Device descriptions are merged

operation.

We should have a function which parses and merges image device mappings

If you try to create a group, but do not include a domain name or id
in the request, then keystone responds with a 401, making it look
like you have an authentication problem.
The correct answer in this case would be a 400 (bad request).
Make domain_id as required in the server side maybe a good choice.

A group cannot exist without domain. If domain_id not provide, it
will use the default domain instead. But maybe some user's conf has
no default domain. And in some other unexcepted case, may not go to
find the default domain. So I think that it's right to create a group
with explictly give domain_id in the request body.

Previously, we tried to load the default plugins by using the path to
bandit to import them dynamically and load them. This is unreliable on
systems where the default path and the actual path are different
depending on how bandit is installed. By using entry-points, we can
completely side-step this problem.

When webob exception is returned, error level log is
always recorded even though we return 4xx (client error)
to users. 4xx error in response code means errors due to
user requests, so error level log is not appropriate.
This commit lowers the log level to INFO for such events.

Currently only case I see is webob.exc.HTTPNotFound returned
by the policy engine when a user requests an operation
prohibited by the policy, but I think there is no reason
we deal with 404 specially in neutron.api.v2.resource.

We want to make sure we never try to get the size of an attached volume
when doing _get_instance_disk_info (as this can cause issues when
gathering available resources).

libvirt's get_available_resources will call upon it to determine the
available disk size on the compute node, but do so without providing
information about block devices. This makes _get_instance_disk_info make
incorrect guesses as to which device is a volume

This patch makes the _get_instance_disk_info be more conservative about
it's guesses when it can not reasonably determine if a device is a
volume or not.
