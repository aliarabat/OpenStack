Tempest is intermittently failing a test which does the
following:

1. Create a server.
2. Shelve offload it.
3. Unshelve it.

Tempest waits for the server status to be SHELVED_OFFLOADED
before unshelving the server, which goes through the
scheduler to pick a compute node and claim resources on it.

When shelve offloading a server, the resource allocations
for the instance and compute node it was on are cleared, which
will also delete the internal consumer record in the placement
service.

The race is that the allocations are removed during shelve
offload *after* the server status changes to SHELVED_OFFLOADED.
This leaves a window where unshelve is going through the
scheduler and gets the existing allocations for the instance,
which are non-empty and have a consumer generation. The
claim_resources method in the scheduler then uses that
consumer generation when PUTing the allocations. That PUT
fails because in between the GET and PUT of the allocations,
placement has deleted the internal consumer record. When
PUTing the new allocations with a non-null consumer generation,
placement returns a 409 conflict error because for a new
consumer it expects the ""consumer_generation"" parameter to be
None.

This change handles the race by detecting the null consumer
situation from the error details from the placement response
and retries the claim_resources() method.

There are a couple of alternative ways we could have dealt
with this:

1. When we get the conflict from placement, re-GET the
   allocations and if they are now empty, retry. This has
   the downside of doing an extra GET operation when we can
   simply deduce the situation from the placement error details.

2. We could remove the allocations during unshelve before
   updating the instance.vm_state. This would solve the race
   for this particular scenario, but is really whack-a-mole
   and we should handle the generation conflict / retry in the
   scheduler in a generic way if possible (which we do here).

The ugly error details parsing can eventually be replaced when
the placement API returns a specific error code for this null
consumer scenario (as the TODO in claim_resources() already suggests).

Add check for missing key during member addition for lbaas.

This happens for k8s-service with a mix of UDP and TCP ports.

DHCP agent has a really strict enforcement of client ID,
which is part of the DHCP extra options. If a VM advertises a client ID,
DHCP agent will automatically release it's lease whenever *any* other
port is updated/deleted. This happens even if no client ID is set on the port.

When reload_allocations() is called, DHCP agent parses the current leases file,
the hosts file, and gets the list all the ports in the network from DB,
computing 3 different sets. The set from leases file (v4_leases) will have
some client ID. The set from port DB will have None.

As a result the set subtraction does not filter out the entry,
and the port's DHCP lease is constantly released, whenever the VM renews its lease
and any other port in the network is updated/deleted, triggering this code path.

So, client ID should only be enforced, and leases released,
if it's actually set on the port DB's DHCP extra Opts.
In that case it means someone knows what they are doing,
and we want to check for a mismatch. If client ID on port is
empty, it should not be treated like an unused lease.

We can't expect end users that just create VMs with auto created ports
to know/care about DHCP client IDs, then manually update ports or
change app templates.

In some cases, like Windows VMs, the client ID is advertised as the MAC by default.
In fact, there is a Windows bug which prevents you from even turning this off:
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3004537/dhcp-client-always-includes-option-61-in-the-dhcp-request-in-windows-8

Linux VMs dont have this on by default, but they may be enabled
in some templates unknown to users.

Backport https://review.openstack.org/#/c/601681/ to stable/pike
was intended to repair bug 1784871, a security issue affecting
the scaleio driver. This backport introduced method
_is_volume_creation_safe, which calls _get_storage_pool_properties.

This change introduces implementation to allow listing of
manageable volumes.

Unprivileged docker-puppet-$service containers don't have access
to devices and can't get facter 'uuid' variable. Therefore per node
hiera customizations don't work. We can work around this by using
/sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid instead.

dmidecode>=3.1 returns system-id in lower case, so it's better to
use lowe case for compatibility.

This would also require changes to the docs as ironic node
introspection data may show it in both cases.

This patch switches the kafka python client from kafka-python to
confluent-kafka due to documented threading issues with the
kafka-python consumer and the recommendation to use multiplrocessing.
The confluent-kafka client leverages the high performance librdkafka
C client and is safe for multiple thread use.

This patch:
* switches to confluent-kafka library
* revises consumer and producer message operations
* utilizes event.tpool method for confluent-kafka blocking calls
* updates unit tests
* adds kafka specific timeouts for functional tests
* adds release note

When queue_event_streamer driver is used and RabbitMQ
is down, stats update processes occupy the thread pool
which is shared with health update processes. Then,
RabbitMQ down unexpectedly leads to delete all existing
amphorae. This commit separates the thread pool and aims
to keep the existing amphorae working even when RabbitMQ
is down.

In addition to the cherry-pick from master, this patch fixes the release
note to not call out a feature but a fix instead, and drop the
deprecation of status_update_threads.

This patch demonstrates using a lightweight os-resource-classes
module for representing resource classes, and managing those classes
in placement in a similar way to os-traits: sync them to the database at
start up time.

The https://github.com/cdent/os-resource-classes package is a very
simple thing: an ordered list of the standard resource classes, ordered
so that ids in the database will be the same as their ids are now, when
using the rc_fields package in nova. It is a lighter weight alternative
to Jay's proposal at https://github.com/jaypipes/os-resource-classes

The placement side of the equation is update to use the new modules
while the nova side continues to use rc_fields.

requirements.txt has been temporarily updated to try to load
os-resource-classes from github, but it's being difficult, so may not
work in the gate. If you want to try this yourself and you can't get it
to work as is, install the package into the virutalenv after the fact.

Subsequent patches will move resource_class_cache into the placement
world, and change how the cache is warmed.

Posting this up to see how people feel about the module and how it might
fit in and whether it is worth pursuing.

...if and only if encryption is enabled. A few things to note about server-side
encryption:

- We register whether encryption is present and enabled when the proxy server
  starts up.
- This is generally considered an operator feature, not a user-facing one. S3
  API users can now learn more about how your cluster is set up than they
  previously could.
- If encryption is enabled but there are no keymasters in the pipeline, all
  writes will fail with ""Unable to retrieve encryption keys.""
- There's still a 'swift.crypto.override' env key that keymasters can set to
  skip encryption, so this isn't a full guarantee that things will be
  encrypted. On the other hand, none of the keymasters in Swift ever set that
  override.

Note that this *does not* start including x-amz-server-side-encryption
headers in the response, neither during PUT nor GET. We should only
send that when we know for sure that the data on disk was encrypted.

This fixes the code that was blindly pop'ing an entry
from an empty list of PCI devices claimed by the instance.
It's not exactly clear how we can get into this situation,
presumably there was a failure in the actual PCI device
claim logic in the ResourceTracker - maybe related to the
configured PCI passthrough whitelist. Regardless, we should
handle the empty PCI device list in this method and raise
an appropriate exception to fail the build on this host.

root disk usage tracking for volume-backed instances
when performing an instance_claim which happens during
the initial server create and unshelve. However, root
disk reporting is still wrong for volume-backed instances
during move claims (resize and evacuate) because a move
claim calls _update_usage_from_migration which passes a
Flavor object to ResourceTracker._get_usage_dict() and
that method didn't have ""is_bfv"" logic in that scenario.

This fixes the bug by always passing the instance object
to the _get_usage_dict() method so we can determine if
it's volume-backed and if so report the root_gb usage as 0.

The related functional regression test is updated
appropriately to show the bug is fixed for volume-backed
instances.

The purpose of the RT._normalize_inventory_from_cn_obj method is
to set allocation_ratio and reserved amounts on standard resource
class inventory records that get sent to placement if the virt driver
did not specifically set a ratio or reserved value (which none but
the ironic driver do).

If the allocation_ratio or reserved amount is in the inventory
data dict from the virt driver, then the normalize method ignores
it and lets the virt driver take priority.

However, with change I6a706ec5966cdc85f97223617662fe15d3e6dc08,
any virt driver that implements the update_provider_tree() interface
is storing the inventory data on the ProviderTree object which gets
cached and re-used, meaning once allocation_ratio/reserved is set
from RT._normalize_inventory_from_cn_obj, it doesn't get unset and
the normalize method always assumes the driver provided a value which
should not be changed, even if the configuration value changes.

We can make the config option changes take effect by changing
the semantics between _normalize_inventory_from_cn_obj and
drivers that implement the update_provider_tree interface, like
for the libvirt driver. Effectively with this change, when a driver
implements update_provider_tree(), they now control setting the
allocation_ratio and reserved resource amounts for inventory they
report. The libvirt driver will use the same configuration option
values that _normalize_inventory_from_cn_obj used. The only difference
is in update_provider_tree we don't have the ComputeNode facade to
get the ""real"" default values when the allocation_ratio is 0.0, so
we handle that like ""CONF.cpu_allocation_ratio or 16.0"". Eventually
that will get cleaned up with blueprint initial-allocation-ratios.

If we're getting Conflict exception on FIP association we should check
if that FIP isn't already associated correctly and if that's the case
ignore the exception. This commit implements that behavior.

This solves the case when kuryr-controller is restarted after FIP
association but before that fact is saved into LBaaSState annotation.

Before performing an upgrade, the new repositories and
activation key should be configured. Rhsm is the service
in charge of performing the overcloud nodes registration,
so we need to enable the new repository/parameters in the
upgrade_tasks to point to the right repositories during
upgrade.
Also, after [0] got merged, the registration is being forced
via --force in case it fails for the first time. Plus,
there is also a new option that allows us to enable only
the repositories passed in rhsm_repos variable, disabling
what is not included and was enabled. We need to pass
this variable set to true during upgrades so we disable
the latest version repositories.

Converts the plain and migration fixtures to use oslo_db
test_fixtures.

The one snag that can be improved on the oslo_db side is
that the generate_schema hooks called by test_fixtures.SimpleDBFixture
are called before the enginefacades have been connected with the
provisioned engine, so an additional patch is called here
as placement's database setup relies upon enginefacade-enabled
methods to insert DB data.

The WalkVersionsMixin here is necessary as the one in
oslo.db is specific to SQLAlchemy-migrate, so oslo.db should
also include this alembic-capable WalkVersionsMixin within
its own modules.

The normal provisioning system of generating anonymously-named
databases within MySQL and Postgresql is in place, which allows
tests to run concurrently in multiple processes without conflicts.

the non-running and 'invalid instance' tests are removed

When ovs-vswitchd process is restarted neutron-ovs-agent will
handle it and reconfigure all ports and openflows in bridges.
Unfortunatelly when tunnel networks are used together with
L2pop mechanism driver, this driver will not notice that agent
lost all openflow config and will not send all fdb entries which
should be added on host.

In such case L2pop mechanism driver should behave in same way like
when neutron-ovs-agent is restarted and send all fdb_entries to
agent.

This patch adds ""simulate"" of agent start flag when ovs_restart is
handled thus neutron-server will send all fdb_entries to agent and
tunnels openflow rules can be reconfigured properly.

Nova is gaining the ability to run TLS over the connection between the
novnc proxy service and the QEMU/KVM compute node VNC server.

This adds a new config param - 'NOVA_CONSOLE_PROXY_COMPUTE_TLS=True' -
which instructs devstack to configure libvirt/QEMU to enable TLS for the
VNC server, and to configure the novncproxy to use TLS when connecting.
NB this use of TLS is distinct from use of TLS for the public facing API
controlled by USE_SSL, they can be enabled independently.

This is done in a generic manner so that it is easy to extend to cover
use of TLS with the SPICE and serial console proxy services too.

This patch changes the FIP allocation to be only
after all LB components were provisioned.

With this approach, the FIP allocation is performed just before
Kuryr annotates endpoints details, this should reduce
the probability for orphan FIPs in case of kuryr-controller
restart.

If we're getting Conflict exception on FIP association we should check
if that FIP isn't already associated correctly and if that's the case
ignore the exception. This commit implements that behavior.

This solves the case when kuryr-controller is restarted after FIP
association but before that fact is saved into LBaaSState annotation.

If there are resources in a template that don't exist in the database at
the time of a stack check (or suspend or resume) operation, running the
stack check will cause them to be stored in the database. Since these
operations have not been converted to convergence (story 1727142), they do
not set the current_template_id as a convergence update would. If this
occurs then the stack will be unrecoverable.

To avoid this, when convergence is enabled store any missing resources in
the same manner that a convergence update would, prior to running the stack
check/suspend/resume.

Just in case, make sure the stack doesn't get stuck if we do end up in the
wrong state, by not trying to load a template with None as an ID.

There is a deployment race where nova-placement fails to start if
the nova api db migration have not finished before starting it.
We start nova placement early to make sure it is up before the
nova-compute services get started. Since in HA scenario there is
no sync in between the nodes on the current worked deployment step
we might have the situation that the placement service gets started
on C1/2 when the nova api db sync is not yet finished on C0.

We have two possibilities:
1) start placement later and verify that nova-computes recover correct
2) verify that db migration on nova_api db finished before start nova-
placement on the controllers

2) which was addressed via https://review.openstack.org/610966 showed
problems:
a) the docker/podman container failed to start with some file not found
error, therefore this was reverted in https://review.openstack.org/619607

b) when the scrip were running on different controllers at the same
time, the way how nova's db_version() is implemented has issues, which
is being worked on in https://review.openstack.org/619622

This patch addresses 1) and moves placement service start to step_4
and adds an additional task on the computes to wait until the placement
service is up.

Previously _destroy_evacuated_instances would not remove instances
associated with evacuation migration records in a pre-migrating state.
This could lead to a race between the original source host and the new
destination if the source returned early, calling init_instance during
the evacuation process.

This change now includes pre-migrating migration records when looking
for active evacuations. Additionally the dict of evacuating instances is
then returned to init_host and used to skip running init_instance
against such instances ensuring no race occurs between the two computes.

The current check uses an alignment of 512 bytes and will fail when the
underlying device has sectors of size 4096 bytes, as is common e.g. for
NVMe disks. So use an alignment of 4096 bytes, which is a multiple of
512 bytes and thus will cover both cases.

2. Change the resource tracker to overwrite the compute node's

the value of these options is NOT ``None`` or ``0.0``.

If the keystone user source is immutable, such as an LDAP active
directory implementation, tempest tests that try to create, delete
or modify a user will fail. Instead of failing, we would like them to
skip. Proposed is an additional config setting in the auth group
called immutable_user_source that is defaulted to false.

To handle this on a test by test basis and avoid modifying behavior
that depends on the identity base class, we propose using a
testtools decorator to skip tests based on the new config setting.

One test class so far has been adjusted to use the decorator, and if
the config setting is set to true, the tests will skip accordingly.

We are debugging slow nodes in bhs1. Looking at dstat data we clearly
have some jobs that end up spending a lot of cpu time in sys and wai

One thought was that this is due to an unhappy hypervisor or two, but
amorin has dug in and found that these slow jobs run on multiple unique

Add a --all option to ci_check_all_candidate_files.py to make it work
in the current mode.

Add an argument to allow the caller to specify individual files to
limit which are validated. This makes it easier to run locally for
someone writing their candidacy file, since the output only includes
information about their file.

Change the default behavior to only validate files in the current
patch being tested. That makes it easier to understand the output in
CI, since it only applies to the patch being tested.

pollsters and the other which has all pollsters.  Additionally the

After the upgrade Apache seems unable to reach the Octavia API.
It appears that the devstack plugin.sh enables the octavia-wsgi site,
but fails to restart the Apache server to pick up this change.

This patch corrects that by restarting Apache after any Apache site
changes.

Ordinary objects in S3 use the MD5 of the object as the ETag, just like
Swift. Multipart Uploads follow a different format, notably including a
dash followed by the number of segments.

Several clients use this difference to change their behavior based upon
the presence of a dash in object ETags, not only during object download
but during upload and listing, too. In particular, this can disable
upload/download integrity checks or cause the client to issue HEAD
requests to see whether the MD5 was stored in metadata on the object.

The goal of this patch is to get as many of the benefits of the dash as
we can, even for data that was uploaded via the Swift API or that
predated the related-changes. To that end (and for S3 API requests
*only*), look for any indication that an object may be an SLO and tack
on a literal '-N' to the end of the ETag. Why 'N'? Two main reasons:

 - We don't necessarily know how many segments there are, and don't want
   to use additional backend requests to find out (particularly when it
   would require *multiple* additional requests as in a bucket listing).
 - We don't want to provide an arbitrary number (as ProxyFS does [1])
   because it would look *too much* like an S3 ETag, and if any client
   actually cares about the *exact* ETag generation algorithm, I'd
   prefer to have a way to distinguish between the two.

This modified ETag will be used in key GET/HEAD responses via the S3
API, where SLOs are always indicated with a X-Static-Large-Object
header. Either the modified or original ETag may be used for conditional
requests via the S3 API. Bucket listings via the S3 API *may* present
the modified ETag, but only if the JSON container listing includes an
'slo_etag' key for the object; see the related SLO patch for when that
started happening.

There should be no impact for the Swift API.

undercloud_upgrade_cleanup variable is controlling upgrade_cleanup in
undercloud.conf, where tripleoclient uses it to set UpgradeRemoveUnusedPackages
in Heat.
If UpgradeRemoveUnusedPackages is set to true, the OpenStack rpms will
be erased from the host.
When a package is erased, very often the systemd service is stopped
before removing the package. It is problematic when Podman is deployed
because some of our containers (e.g. haproxy) have the same name from
baremetal services.

Note: UpgradeRemoveUnusedPackages was kept for our operators to want to
do some cleanup during the upgrade, if they didn't do it in Rocky when
the parameter was implemented. This parameter will be deprecated and
removed in the future.

Some options were explored:

1) Hack in the yum module to not try to stop the service when removing
the package. It sounds difficult and would increase technical debt.

2) Rename Systemd services for each Podman containers (in Paunch). But
our operators would have to learn 2 names: container name in podman and
service name in systemd. This idea isn't ideal for them.

3) Ignore the package removal task in THT if container_cli == podman.
This is not very useful in Stein since we are moving the default to
Podman anyway.

4) Keep UpgradeRemoveUnusedPackages set to false by default, document that
UpgradeRemoveUnusedPackages should not be set to true if podman is used
and update our CI to not set UpgradeRemoveUnusedPackages to true when
podman is enabled.

In this patch, we retain option #4 and update featureset050 which tests
containerized undercloud upgrades from Rocky/Docker to Stein/Podman.
UpgradeRemoveUnusedPackages will be set to false, so packages (not here
anyway) won't tried to be removed, and podman containers won't be
stopped during the upgrade.

Current FC tries to limit the scanning range by detecting the target and
channel, unfortunately this code has a good number of implementation
issues:

- Matching uses local WWNN instead of target's WWPN.
- Not using a shell to run the command, so the * glob won't expand.
- Not using -l on grep command to list file names instead of contents.
- Not making the search case insensitive.

This patch fixes all these issues by using the target's WWPNs instead
-taking into account FC Zone/Access control information if present- and
supporting both possible connection information formats for the WWPNs
(single value or list of values).

Rescan tests have been modified to adhere to unit tests best practices,
where each test case only tests the specific code in the method under
test and mocks everything else.

that the ansible has a working execution path to the monitor over
what ever connection plugin is used.

This patch implements API part to the feature of exposing conductors
information.

A new API object Conductor is added to provide endpoints below:

* GET /v1/conductors for listing conductor resources
* GET /v1/conductors/{hostname} for showing a conductor

V1 endpoint discovery and default policy are updated.

A conductor field is added to Node API object, which returns in
/v1/nodes* related endpoints.

Considering patch size and microversion conflicting with other api
patches, api-ref would go in another patch if no strong opinions.

Things have changed here on Walton's Mountain since LazyLoad was
introduced [1]. It seems to have been created to avoid a circular
import, but as this patch should attest, that's no longer an issue.

Why change this now, besides removing weird and complicated code?
Because a subsequent patch needs to access a *property* of the report
client from the compute manager. As written, LazyLoad only lets you get
at *methods* (as functools.partial). There are other ways to solve that
while preserving the deferred import, but if this works, it's the better
solution.

Filter Scheduler uses the so-called weights during its work. A weigher
is a way to select the best suitable host from a group of valid hosts by
giving weights to all the hosts in the list.

In the current implementation, the weights are controlled by config
options like [filter_scheduler]/cpu_weight_multiplier.
The total weight of a compute node is calculated by combination of
several weighers:
weight = w1_multiplier * norm(w1) + w2_multiplier * norm(w2) + ...

As it is controlled by config options, the weights are global across the
whole deployment, and this is not efficient enough for operators.

This spec proposes to be able to override the weight configuration
options using aggregate metadata to provide a more fine-grained
control over resource weights.

For leap 15, some of the package names are different so updating their
names to reflect that. Verified these change when building openstack
service images from openstack helm. Openstack helm uses profile which
adds additional dependencies in images and may be that's why this issue
(different package name) is not encountered in loci internal build process.

This reverts commit fff0a81acb664f1cafc054404f962ec8723232b0.

During scale tests we saw that neutron agent aliveness mechanism is not
working properly and was marking agents as down and thus failing on port
binding. We assessed that aliveness in our context is not actually
interesting, as we only use the agentdb mechanism to store the
information we need for port binding.

As a result of this assessment we decided to remove the aliveness
awareness from the code and try to bind the port disregarding that. The
consequence of this is that a ""neutron agent-list"" call might show the
agent as dead or alive but that's not information we should depend on to
understand if we are binding to that node.

python-tempestconf exposes lots of named arguments like image,
network, deployer-input, account-file, out, os-cloud. In order
to handle this, we need to introduce lots of vars which will
become memory intense while running the ansible role. In order
to reduce it, let's use a single var and pass the needed
arguments to that.

It moves remove, out and network named arguments to use the same
var.

This change is here to gauge the willingness of neutron maintainers
of a backward incompatible fix for bug #1806032. As described in the
bug report, updating router:external may lead to invalid things like
a 'router:external=False' network with floating IPs.

I suspect there never was a use case for updating the router:external
attribute of a network, but I may be wrong. And even if there was no
use case, disabling update is clearly backward incompatible.

On the other hand this would be the nice and easy fix for this bug.

The IPMI driver unconditionally instructed the BMC not automatically
clear boot flag valid bit if Chassis Control command not received within
60-second timeout (countdown restarts when a Chassis Control command is
received).  Some BMCs do not support setting this.  Sending the command
aborts the node boot.

A new driver option ``ipmi_disable_timeout`` is added to bypass
sending this command.
