When abre MPLS is used, ARP is currently triggered on the
interface that routes to the BGP next hop.

In practice, the interface has to be the MPLS bridge.

This change modifies the driver behavior and the devstack
plugin system configuration function to reflect that.

Additionally, a ping is used just to trigger an ARP resolution,
but we don't need the ping to actually succeed, and we want
in fact to support cases where the neighbor may not be responding
to pings. So we proceed even if the ping failed.

Currently the DHCP agent relies on the acceptance of an
RA to configure its IPv6 address with SLAAC or DHCPv6-stateless
network modes.  It should explicitly assign addresses to the
agent based on the data model instead.

In order to do this we must disable RAs in the namespace so
that a static assignment doesn't conflict with a previously
created dynamically-generated address.

The DHCP namespace used to always have its IPv6 default
route configured from a received Router Advertisement (RA).
A recent change [1] disabled receipt of RAs, instead
relying on the network topology to configure the namespace.
Unfortunately the code only added an IPv4 default route,
which caused a regression with DNS resolution in some
circumstances where IPv6 was being used.

A default route is now added for both IP versions.

This changes embed another commit to fix a regression introduced
by the first one.

In https://review.openstack.org/#/c/436958, we fix a thread safety
issue. But we make the ack/requeue of message asynchronous. In nominal
case, it works, but if network/rabbit connection issue occurs this
can result to rpc call handle twice. By chance we double check already
processed message ids, and drop duplicates, but that if the message
goes to another node, the mitigation won't work.

This restore the previous behavior, to ensure we run application
callback of rpc.call/rpc.cast only when the message have been
successfully ack.

Change Idcbada705c1d38ac5fd7c600141c2de7020eae25 in Ocata
started preferring Cinder connection info for getting RBD auth
values since Nova needs to be using the same settings as Cinder
for volume auth.

However, that introduced a problem for guest connections made
before that change, where the secret_uuid might not have been
configured on the Cinder side and that's what is stored in the
block_device_mappings.connection_info column and is what we're
checking in _set_auth_config_rbd. Before Ocata this wasn't a
problem because we'd use the Nova configuration values for the
rbd_secret_uuid if set. But since Ocata it is a problem since
we don't consult nova.conf if auth was enabled, but not completely
configured, on the Cinder side.

So this adds a fallback check to set the secret_uuid from
nova.conf if it wasn't set in the connection_info via Cinder
originally. A note is also added to caution about removing
any fallback mechanism on the nova side - something we'd
need to consider before we could likely drop this code.

Reduce bcrypt hashing rounds from 12 to 4 (minimal possilbe).

This is going to imporve a lot of perforamcne of OpenStack.

Bcrypt is hashing algorithm that is designed to use a lot of resources and
in that way stops brutforce attacks. It's exponential algorithm that depends
on amount of rounds. By default they use 12 rounds which is quite high value,
good enough for real secure production enviorments.

In case of DevStack it's going to slow down all authentication by many times.
Rally shows about 5 times slownest (adding 2-5 seconds to every authenticate)
DevStack is meant for developemnt & CI so performance is way more important than
security.

Change 6865f4d9f22d5daa2f07ff9651c2280aed489c8c mistakenly
assumed that None would not be present for the 'original'
property on a PortContext. However, this is the default value
for the original field in PortContext, which is what is used
in the construction as part of the _create_port_db process
in ML2.

This resulted in binding failures for the macvtap mech drivers
due to an attribute error in cases like brand new ports.

This patch simply checks for None before trying to determine
if it's a live migration (which it isn't in the case of port creation).

Part of the issue is likely that the FakePortContext in the unit tests
was defaulting to an empty dict which is the not the same behavior as
the real PortContext.

Add BaseApp functions to get guest image properties.
Implemented several potential candidates.

Changed the Cassandra App to use the new base
as a demonstration.

A sample metadata file would look like:

 [trove]
 user_name = TROVE SYSTEM USER
 user_group = TROVE USER GROUP

 [datastore]
 service_name = SERVICE NAME (i.e. 'service candidate')
 service_user_name = SERVICE SYSTEM USER
 service_user_group = SERVICE USER GROUP
 config_dir = SERVICE CONFIG DIR (i.e. '/etc/cassandra/')
 data_dir = SERVICE DATA DIR (i.e. '/var/lib/cassandra/')
 bin_dir = SERVICE BINARIES (i.e. tools not available on the PATH)
 default_user = DEFAULT DATABASE USER (i.e. 'cassandra')
 default_password = DEFAULT DATABASE PASSWORD (i.e. 'cassandra')

 [cassandra]
 # sample section for Cassandra where it could define
 # anything unique to the datastore (default password hash).

A datastore can access any value by its name and section.
A default value returned if the property (or the whole metadata file)
does not exist may be provided.

 - Default can be a dict with the OS names for keys. The value for the
   current OS will be returned.

TODOs:

 - Where should we put the metadata file? (currently '~/guest_metadata')

 - Which properties should be exposed via the base interface?
   (I tried to cover the common stuff.
    Each datastore can already get whathever specific property it likes
    via 'get_guest_property'. Any other 'get_xxx' methods?)

 - What would be the best interface for the App?
   (This closely relates to the above point.
    Each datastore currently rolls its own properties such as
    'cassandra_conf_dir'.
    It would make sense to have a standard interface like
    say 'service_candidates', 'configuration_manager', 'status',
    'datastore_xxx_dir'...)

 - How do we handle new datastores?
   (Do we just require themto have the file
   [no need to override anything]?
   Or do we still want to guess if the file does not exist
   [each datastore will need to provide its defaults for at least one OS])?

 - How do we handle existing datastores?
   (Assuming we provide metadata for our existing datastores
   [write them in kick-start elements] we keep guessing for the existing
   datastores for backwards compatibility)?

done by overriding the form class.

This commit overrides the create router form and deletes

In many occasions we had log directory initialization containers
without `detach: false`, which didn't guarantee that they'll finish
before the container depending on them will start using the log
directory.

This is now fixed by moving the initialization container one global
step earlier, so that we can keep the concurrency when creating the
log dirs. (Using `detach: false` makes paunch handle just one
container at a time, and as such it can have negative performance
impact.)

For services which have their container(s) starting in step_1,
initialization cannot be moved to an earlier step, so the solution
here was to just add `detach: false`.

As a minor related change, cinder DB sync container now mounts the log
directory from host to put cinder-manage.log into the expected
location.

    Initial implementation

    Changes in the mechanism driver:

        * Automatically create a port with device_owner=network:dhcp to
          serve metadata and eventually DHCP.
        * Auto-allocate an IP for the metadata port on subnet creation.
        * Push static route for 169.254.169.254 in DHCP options.

    Agent:

        * Implementation of [0]

    Devstack plugin:

        * Starts networking-ovn-agent with the proper config files.
        * Disables config drive in nova.conf.
        * Disables TEMPEST_RUN_VALIDATION

    TODO:

        * Write tests.
        * Wait until we're serving metadata for a certain datapath before
          sending the vif plugged event to Nova.

    In order to test this patch out we need to make this changes to
    nova.conf:

        * [DEFAULT] section:
          force_config_drive = False
        * [neutron] section:
          service_metadata_proxy = True

we need to support microversions. In order to support microversions, we
need to be using REST. Yolanda needs to pass tags to the nics parameter,

Tests are modified to remove an extra GET call that novaclient makes
that we don't actually need.

A follow up to this will add microversion discovery, and then will add
support for 'tags' being in the nics list.

This is a tool to automate the generation of our sample environment
files.  It takes a yaml file as input, and based on the environments
defined in that file generates a number of sample environment files
from the parameters in the Heat templates.  A tox genconfig target
is added that mirrors how the other OpenStack services generate
their sample config files.

A description of the available options for the input file is
provided in a README file in the sample-env-generator directory.

In this commit only a single sample config is provided as a basic
example of how the tool works, but subsequent commits will add
more generated sample configs.

The ismount_raw method does not work inside containers if disks are
mounted on the hostsystem and only mountpoints are exposed inside the
containers. In this case the inode and device checks fail, making this
option unusable.

Mounting devices into the containers would solve this. However, this
would require that all processes that require access to a device are
running inside the same container, which counteracts the container
concept.

This patch adds the possiblity to place stubfiles named "".ismount"" into
the root directory of any device, and Swift assumes a given device to be
mounted if that file exists. This should be transparent to existing
clusters.

reading/writing to the database and when serializing/deserializing
(for RPC). Internally, the services deal with the latest versions
of the objects.

Version column is introduced to make sure reading the DB object
versions happens transparently for the developer. An exception
is raised in case of a version compatibility error.

The version column is null at first and will be filled with the
appropriate versions by a data migration script in a following patch.

This patch adds the `galera_disable_privatedevices` variable that
allows deployers to disable PrivateDevices in the systemd unit file
shipped with MariaDB 10.1+ on CentOS 7 systems.

This is a workaround to fix the systemd/LXC issues with bind
mounting an already bind mounted `/dev/ptmx` inside the LXC
container.

details.

through SNAT thanks to the way conntrack tracks ""new"" connections.  This
patch sets ""nf_connctrack_tcp_loose"" inside the SNAT namespace to more
intelligently handle SNAT traffic (and ignore what should be FIP

When a user is not authorized to see a given resource, we need to
convert HTTP 403s into HTTP 404s to avoid giving away information
that the resource exists. However, the previous code was being
overaggressive and doing this conversion even in some cases where
the user is allowed to see the resource and really needs to know
that what they were trying to do is forbidden, not be told that the
resource doesn't exist. This fixes that logic to only do the 403
to 404 conversion when truly appropriate.

When l3 agent node is rebooted, if HA network port status is already
ACTIVE in DB, agent will get this status from server and then spawn
the keepalived (though l2 agent might not have wired the port),
resulting in multiple HA masters active at the same time.

To fix this, when the L3 agent starts up we can have it explicitly
set the port status to DOWN for all of the HA ports on that node.
Then we are guaranteed that when they go to ACTIVE it will be because
the L2 agent has wired the ports.

disk_available_least is a free disk size information of hypervisors.
This is calculated by the following fomula:

But stopped instance's virtual disk sizes were not calculated

file_path is implicitly required if file dispatcher is enabled,
because if it is not set, no data will be record, and user get no
message from neither option help string nor log.

This patch logs a warning message for user in such scenario.

Another solution is raise an exception then the file dispatcher
will not be loaded, but considering this dispatcher is not for
production environment, such behavior seems a bit aggressive.

In order to add more options, let's do a refactor and improve the code a
bit. One of the improvements is that it now waits for the stack not to
be in progress anymore before proceeding to show the stack outputs.

The building of the group ""repo_masters"" relies on going through
the inventory, but we never check if the hosts are added in a
particular order. While it should follow the ansible inventory
order (that's the play order by default), the inclusion of the
host to a group could happen at any time, because the play runs
all the hosts in parallel.

If we ensure the hosts are run serially, the addition of the
hosts to the architecture dependant repo_ groups will always
be done in the right order.

We can then use these groups to find which host is the first one,
and use it as ""repo_master"".

1. What is the problem
QoS is defined as the ability to guarantee certain network requirements
like bandwidth, latency, jitter, and reliability in order to satisfy a
Service Level Agreement (SLA) between an application provider and end
tenants. Networks or ports in local Neutron can not be associated with
QoS policy automatically yet.

2. What is the solution to the problem
Using asynchronous jobs to complete the automation of QoS policy/rule
in local Neutrons.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
to realize the solution?
QoS.

* set_tags() operation for network, subnet, port, subnetpool and router
  resource. Tag support is implemented as a mixin class
  as tag support for more resources is being planned.
* Tag operation in the network proxy class
* Tag related query parameters

Tag support in neutron follows API-WG guideline.
https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/api-wg/guidelines/tags.html

In the API, four operations are defined: replace tags, add a tag,
remove a tag, remove all tags, but we can do all operations by
using only 'replace tags'. In addition, updating attributes of
most network resources is an operation to replace an existing value
to a new one, so I believe this applies to 'tags' attribute.

The commit with change id [1], added the pacemaker HA support
for OVN DB servers. That commit created a new VIP which is
really not required.

This patch removes the code to create a new ip resource. Instead
it expects the pacemaker ip resource (with the ip address in the
'ovn_dbs_vip' parameter and with the name ""ip-$ovn_dbs_vip"") to be
created before ovn_northd class is called, which is the case anyway
if 'ovn_dbs_vip' is taken from the ServiceNetMapDefaults (in t-h-t).

This patch implements a dhcp-proxy-service within the networking-odl v2
driver framework.  At the core of this patch is the business logic to
create DHCP Neutron ports specifically for use by OpenDaylight's DHCP
Service (these DHCP Neutron ports will be different from DHCP ports
allocated by stock Neutron-DHCP-Agent).
As a result this patch enables OpenDaylight Controller deployments to
provide DHCP services using the DHCP Neutron Ports handcrafted by this
patch.

adding a create_port method.

Currently this just performs the port object creation but in a future
change this will be used to validate the physical network assignment of
ports in a portgroup when a port is created, ensuring that all ports in
the group have the same physical network.

The mistral action had a strange conditional where it would only
retrieve the endpoint when trust tokens are used, and otherwise rely on
the client to do so. It seems to make more sense to do it all the time,
especially for services which uses trust tokens to talk to Mistral (eg
Heat).

Previously the libvirt driver would always assume that it was only
detaching devices (volumes or virtual interfaces) from a persistent
domain however that is not always the case.

For example when rolling back from a live migration an attempt is made
to detach volumes from the transient destination domain that is being
cleaned up. This attempt would fail with the previous assumption of the
domain being persistent in place.

This change introduces a simple call to has_persistent_configuration
within detach_device_with_retry to confirm the state of the domain
before attempting to detach.

The call to wait_for_plug_events will give a timeout waiting
for the plug event when using neutron-ovs-agent.

This patch addresses this issue by moving the call to plug_vifs
from power_on to after the create_instance call, which is prior
to waiting for plug events. This change modifies the behaviour
of power_on only during the instance spawn, the other calls
remaining the same.

libffi-dev is required to install cffi and PyNaCL from tarballs.
cffi is installed from requirements.txt, so 'test' profile is not

We usual use wheel packages when installing python packages,
but tarball is sometimes used, for example, when a new version
is uploaded. I think it is worth adding it to bindep.txt
to avoid accidental gate failure.

This patch enables operators to configure read/write affinity per
policy.

Prior to this change, the affinity settings in proxy-server.conf were
applied globally. However, depending on how region and zone settings are
defined in each policy ring, defining a global read/write affinity is
not ideal for the cluster. With this change, operators have the choice to
set the affinity option at the policy level.

e.g.
policy-0 -> r1 and r2
policy-1 -> r3

This patch introduces the suffix format, ""_policy_N"" for both write_affinity
and read_affinity. The existing setting write_affinity and read_affinity are
still used as the default and operators can override the default value via
write_affinity_policy_N or read_affinity_policy_N options in the
proxy-server.conf

For develpers:
- swift.common.utils.affinity_locality_predicate always returns
  single-argument function
- swift.proxy.server.sort_nodes requires policy as an arg which can be
  None if it's unnecessary (e.g. GET account/container)

Change Idcbada705c1d38ac5fd7c600141c2de7020eae25 in Ocata
started preferring Cinder connection info for getting RBD auth
values since Nova needs to be using the same settings as Cinder
for volume auth.

However, that introduced a problem for guest connections made
before that change, where the secret_uuid might not have been
configured on the Cinder side and that's what is stored in the
block_device_mappings.connection_info column and is what we're
checking in _set_auth_config_rbd. Before Ocata this wasn't a
problem because we'd use the Nova configuration values for the
rbd_secret_uuid if set. But since Ocata it is a problem since
we don't consult nova.conf if auth was enabled, but not completely
configured, on the Cinder side.

So this adds a fallback check to set the secret_uuid from
nova.conf if it wasn't set in the connection_info via Cinder
originally. A note is also added to caution about removing
any fallback mechanism on the nova side - something we'd
need to consider before we could likely drop this code.

Co-Authored-By: Tadas Ustinavičius <tadas@ring.lt>

NOTE(mriedem): The unit test is modified slightly to not
pass an instance to the disconnect_volume method as that
was only available starting in Pike: b66b7d4f9d

Virtuozzo containers based on OS-level virtualization.
OS containers don't use swap as additional disk.
So Virtuozzo doesn't support swap in terms of OpenStack.
We should fail ""nova boot"" operation if
user try to create Virtuozzo container which is based on flavor with swap disk.

In this patch we move the code which checks swap disk
to the beginning of the function.
We should check swap disk before creating ephemeral and root disk, because
in case of error we don't need to delete created disks.

Version discovery currently has excellent support for getting a
requested version, and of also getting just whatever the catalog said.
There are users though who would like to say ""hey, man, give me the
latest thing you've got regardless of what's in the catalog."" (One would
be correct in surmising that I am one such user)

While we're in there, make it so that we reward people who put
unversioned endpoints into the catalog. Change the order of operations
to be ""first grab the document from the url in the catalog, check to see
if it can satisfy the questions, then if not, try to do the
version_hacks to get an unversioned document that can"". It also has the
benefit of not needing to do version hacks if the versioned endpoint is
in the catalog and the version matches the requested version. It will
mean there is an additional API call in the case where the versioned
endpoint is in the catalog and a user requests a different version (one
for the versioned, match fails, one for the unversioned)

The ring up- and downloading was never executed if run within a
containerized environment. This is due to the fact that this manifest
gets executed within step 6(5) only. There is also an ordering issue,
which actually tries to create the tarballs before rebalancing.

This patch fixes the step conditions and also chains the tarball
creation to the rebalance.

The check to query rings on all nodes can now be disabled. This is
required on containerized environments: the local ring will be modified
and rebalanced, but rings on the existing servers are not yet modified.
Therefore a recon-check will fail, and needs to be disabled.

For the new EndpointData object, in the (admittedly uncommon) case where
the user is not providing an interface and the catalog is v2, the user
would wind up with an EndpointData with no url or interface, rather than
an EndpointData for each v2 endpoint_type found with url and interface
set properly.

This normalizes into v3 format so that the construction and be
straightforward, and introduces a denormalize used in the
ServiceCatalogV2 to re-combine the entries into the format expected by
V2 users of get_endpoints().

The existing version discovery process is awesome, but in the normal flows it
ultimately returns urls, not the full endpoint data, so it's not
possible to know what version was discovered.

Make an EndpointData object that gets created and plumb that through the
stack so that it's possible to request EndpointData instead of just
endpoints. The existing discovery logic is unchanged, and the existing
methods continue to return the data they returned before.

the workaround conditional on the requests version, so that with

support in CephFS is experimental and comes with a list of
caveats, so this patch changes the value shown in the example
to be ""false"" as well as adds a warning after the command to
enable snapshots in the doc explaining the risks involved with
CephFS snapshots.

HorizonSecureCookies is incompatible with non-ssl deployments, which
is our default deployment method.  When SSL is in use, it can be
turned on in the enable-tls.yaml file.  This does mean that
existing users won't automatically get this feature turned on as
part of their upgrade because enable-tls.yaml is an environment that
is intended to be copied and edited, but it's simple to add the
parameter to the file for users who want that behavior after they
upgrade to a version where it is available.

When the ping test runs (in the undercloud) to ping to the
floating ip of the VM, ping count of 1 is not sufficient
and it could fail for some SDN controllers. In the case of
OVN (wherein it has native L3 support and unlike neutron
reference implementation it doesn't create router namespaces),
when the VM sends the icmp (ping) response, the OVN router
pipeline generates an ARP packet to learn the mac address
of the next hop (if it hasn't already learnt yet, which is always
the case for the fist packet) causing the first ping reply packet
to be lost. Also there is no harm in increasing the count to 3.

Generally with nested stacks, when validating the parent stack we don't
validate the property *values* in the nested stack as we recurse down (i.e.
the strict_validate flag is set to False on the nested stack). We validate
the values when we come to actually create the nested stack.

ResourceChain is an exception - the line of code to do this was commented
out without explanation during initial development of the resource. This
has two consequences:

* Resources in the child stack always have their property values validated
  during the validation of the root stack, as well as when the child stack
  is created. (Property values should be examined only in the latter
  validation pass).
* Since ea2673fb9a04588e0e294d159945d075657b9112, any grandchild stacks
  (i.e. where a member of the ResourceChain is itself a StackResource of
  type) will not be validated at all during the validation of the root
  stack. (They should be still validated, though property values will not
  be examined.)

This change makes ResourceChain behave like other StackResources.

To fix this, when the L3 agent starts up we can have it explicitly

Then we are guaranteed that when they go to ACTIVE it will be because

This patch allows read only view of the policies, displaying the name,
id, description and shared status of each policy. Policy actions and
rules to be added in follow-up patches.

To test:
Neutron's QoS plugin must be enabled in your setup.
To enable the QoS plugin in devstack please add the following lines
in the local.conf

    enable_plugin neutron git://git.openstack.org/openstack/neutron
    enable_service q-qos

and rebuild your stack (./stack.sh).

Create some qos policies via CLI (neutron qos-policy-create policy1).
now you can list the policies using this patch.
