Implement get_size(), and use it for the second part of the return
value of get().

Convert the old-style functional tests into tests using the store test
base class. These test the store api directly, and are more up to date
than the old functional tests that went through the api. The store tests
base class already includes tests for get() and get_size().

 * Config doc: http://wiki.openstack.org/QuantumDevstackOvsXcp

 * For a single-node devstack configuration, the DHCP agent will
   to run in the compute domU, which means DHCP servers need to attach to
   ports on an integration bridge in domU.  For DHCP service to be
   available to VM's, the dom0 and domU integration bridges need to be
   joined via a common interface and traffic between the two bridges
   trunked, and DHCP ports on the domU bridge need to be tagged with the
   appropriate local vlan.
 * Two changes are implied by this use-case:
   1. The OVS agent, which is responsible for tagging ports with the
      local vlan associated with the port's network, needs to tag ports
      on both the dom0 and domU integration bridges.  Since the agent
      keeps local vlan state in memory, running more than one agent
      would require a state-sharing mechanism, so this implementation
      chose the simpler path of relying on a single agent to interact
      with both the dom0 and domU bridges.  The major change was
      updating port-handling methods to be passed the bridge associated
      with a port, rather than presuming a default bridge.
   2. The OVS agent needs to ignore the interface between the dom0 and
      domU bridges.  The interface is not known to Quantum and the agent
      would put the associated port on the 'dead vlan', effectively
      cutting off communication between the bridges.  This
      implementation changes the agent to ignore ports on the dom0
      bridge that have mac addresses used by interfaces in domU.

The existing absolute limit tests were passing hard-coded values for
`flavor_ref` and `image_ref`. This patch switches it to use the values defined
in the tempest config.

Since these hard-coded values were incorrect, it imposed an order on which the
validation checks in Nova had to be run, which is not something we want.

By passing correct data, we're only testing that the limit test was performed,
not that it was performed before the image-check, for example.

If you're using eventlet and have code like this:

    except SomeException as err:
        log_this_error(err)
        raise

then you're vulnerable to a race condition that could cause the
reraise to fail. What happens is that log_this_error() does some
socket IO (e.g. to syslog), and that IO gives eventlet an opportunity
to trampoline to a different greenthread, and by the time your
greenthread resumes, the current exception has been cleared, so the
bare ""raise"" statement causes its own exception.

The fix is simple: don't use the implicit current exception.

    except SomeException as err:
        log_this_error(err)
        raise err   # <--- now the race is fixed

This commit cleans up a whole bunch of places where the implicit
current exception was used. Most of them were harmless as there was no
IO between the catching and the reraising, but given that merely
logging can cause the problem, I'd rather not have a bunch of
landmines laying around the codebase.

Add release_instance_quota_before_deletion flag. If set to true, don't
wait for the instance to be actually deleted to release the user's
quota. Delete the instance after the user submits the delete request but
before the actual deletion process starts. This is relevant when
deletion fails due to a problem with the infrastructure and the instance
gets stuck in task_state=deleting and vm_state=active. With that flag
set to false, the instance will still count against the user's quota
(until the user submits the delete request again, which would release
the quota). With the flag set to true, the instance will no longer count
against the quota.

Make the NFS share selection more intelligent by using a used_ratio
and oversub_ratio to determine the valid target.  The used_ratio
is a hard-cap of maximum ""actual"" used space, oversub_ratio allows
for oversubscription of the share based upon the apparant-allocated
space for sparse files.

Removed Options: nfs_disk_util

New options added:
* nfs_used_ratio:
    Float representation of the maximum allowed usage (e.g. 0.95
    calculated by available_space / total_space) before the share
    is no longer concidered a valid target.  Default: 0.95

* nfs_oversub_ratio:
    Float representation of the oversubscriotion ratio allowed when
    utilizing sparse files (determined via ""du"").  This gets
    multiplied against the total_capacity before comparing the
    apparant space used by the backing volume files.  Default
    ratio is 1.0 (meaning reserved/allocated space cannot exceed
    total space available on the mount).

Move and refactor methods from 152_migration that allows us to change
type of deleted column to type of id.

There are 2 methods:

utils.change_deleted_column_type_to_id_type() method
This method change type of `deleted` column from Boolean to
type of `id`. This method allows us to do it in generic way
for all backends. It fix problem with sqlite, that doesn't
allow any operation with columns that have CheckConstraints.
And columns with Boolean type have CheckConstraints
(value in (0, 1)). So for sqlite it works through shadow tables.
For others dbs it works though alter table.

utils.change_deleted_column_type_to_boolean_type() methods
This method allows us to revert result of previous method.
Useful for downgrade.

In global these methods could be very useful in olso for other
projects. This is a first step that allows us to create unique
constraints when we are using soft delete.
(Create UC on (column, deleted))

Also it will be useful in nova to remove copy past from 179
migration. Add new migration that will fix also shadow_cells table.
And also there are baremetal tables that should be also migrated.

Part of fixing bug #995287

Syncs these two commits from oslo-incubator:

  Support overriding oslo localedir too
  Add a gettextutils.install() helper function

to get a new gettextutils.install() function which allows the default
localedir to be overwritten via an environment variable.

Note that gettextutils.install() must be called before any other glance
modules are imported since some modules attempt to translate strings
at import time (e.g. the help strings for config options in config.py).
This is broken and inefficient, but fixing it involves adding something
like spinx's l_() function and would be very invaisve.

Also, note that calling gettextutils.install() in glance.cmd.__init__
means that no program which uses a different translation domain should
ever import any of the modules under glance.cmd.

This patch sets up a new API to be exposed by the nova-conductor
service.  The existing methods exposed by conductor are all proxy
operations on behalf of compute nodes.

For Havana, we have plans to add methods that go the other direction.
Operations initiated by the API will be processed by the conductor,
which will include telling one or more compute nodes what to do.  By
putting all operations of this form in their own API, it will keep
things a bit more clearly separated.

This reverts commit e8b665edbfcd86488f75ed0b79dafdedbf8f5950.

The previous commit created an incompatibility in using new nova
client with older nova server. Nova client needs to be always
releasable, and work with all nova server API versions out there.

The Xenserver/XCP part of devstack was configuring the hypervisor's
connectivity to the outer world, by adding VLANs, and physical
interfaces to the virtual networks. It added a lot of complexity, and
made it hard to get started with XenServer. This patch removes that
extra complexity, so it is left as an exercise for the user.

Support for Account Listing by reusing the account servers

Support is optional and controlled by two configuration parameters
  namespace = <a reserved account name for the namespace> or None
    * None is the default
Setting namespace to None disables the mechanism.

E.g. with:
  namespace = AUTH_***

Account listing is enabled by listing the namespace
    GET /v1/AUTH_***
    or
    GET /v1/AUTH_***?prefix=ab

DELETE, POST, PUT account operations on the configured namespace are
forbidden PUT container into the configured namespace is forbidden

Implementation is simple as it reuses the account-container
relationship to form an account-namespace relationship.

Daemon for collecting lost accounts is planed as a future enhancement

If a resize is attempted on an instance that was started from an image
that has since been deleted, a resize will fail. This change makes error
reporting a bit cleaner.

This change is needed since in order to actually properly support
resize/migrate when the image is deleted - it is necessary for nova to keep
a copy of the image metadata and re-use it in case of migration/resize.

A virt driver can raise InstanceFaultRollback to indicate that the
instance should be reset to ACTIVE.  However, the code that resets to
ACTIVE does not reset task_state to None.

This patch fixes that.  Technically, there's currently no bug here,
because the compute manager methods that matter here all have the
reverts_task_state() decorator to always reset task_state to None on
exceptions.  However, a bug would be introduced later if we remove
those decorators.

exist in the context of a project, just like Compute and Object Store.

Also, users will currently see 'Orchestration' as the title of this

To have consistent option group name format across projects,
oslo.config 1.2.0 normalizes all non lowercase group names to lowercase
when loading conf files.

Thus conf files are backwards compatible but option group references
in the code must now use lowercase before Quantum updates oslo.config.

In the process of switching option group names to lowercase in Quantum,
we've confronted a problem which breaks gateing tests using devstack
because oslo.config 1.2.0 is not yet adapted but devstack inisets on
group name 'OVS'.

To resolve this problem this patch adds an duplicate iniset on option group
'ovs' for each iniset of options below group 'OVS'

Right now the memcache_servers function is used throughout a number of
the cookbooks. For those who have not defined a memcache role, this
can be problematic as it uses search. This would also be problematic
for those wanting to use chef-solo without search and/or test-kitchen.

So, just provide an override attribute to override search for
memcache_servers.

New test added to support this and all tests pass.

When cloning a volume with SolidFire driver, the owner of
the cloned volume is not set correctly in SolidFire when there is
a transfer of ownership.

This results in inconsistent states where the cloned volume
is owned by the new tenant in Cinder but SolidFire thinks it is still
owned by the original volume's tenant.

This patch adds the newAccountID parameter to all CloneVolume calls.

If the cloned volume is owned by the same tenant, newAccountID will
be set to the same value as the original SolidFire volume. There
will be no change of ownership done by the cloning process in SolidFire.

If the cloned volume should be owned by a different tenant, newAccountID
will be set to the appropriate SolidFire account corresponding
to the new tenant. If the SolidFire account does not exist already,
it will be created.

With nova coverage extension disabled as a default behaviour,
nova will create lots of empty folders under /tmp folder. And also
with each time the nova service reboot, it will create a new
directory with name like nova_coverage_*. There will be number of
the empty folders accumulated.

Import zookeeper.membership rather than zookeeper.membersip.
Also fixed some issues with setting up the tests for the zookeeper
servicegroup driver.  Config options were not being set before
initializing the driver leading to failures.

There is no added test for this because the bug is indistinguishable
from not having the zookeeper python modules installed, which leads to
skipping these servicegroup tests.

The previous LWRP used HTTP/S to interrogate and modify
opentstack-identity data. As the API is somewhat of a moving target,
migrate the register provider to include everything it had previously,
combine that with the credentials provider, and rework all the
identity calls to use the Identity (keystone) CLI tools.

This logic follows the same logic that was found in the previous
provider. In fact, code was recycled where appropriate - much of the
same log messages and branch logic remain.

The two functions that power this methodology are:
identity_command - calls the identity client with the parameters
supplied and returns stdout upon success. Upon failure, raise a
RuntimeException with the message being stderr.
identity_uuid - wrapper around identity_command that given a type
of resource to interrogate and an index for the data returned, will
provide the UUID of the target or nil if not found. Upon error, this
function will bubble up an exception.

These changes are accompanied by some spec tests to test the various
function of the LWRP itself.

Bumping the openstack-common dependency to 0.2.1.

All tests pass.

During spawn, if a local volume for the backing block device fails to

The fix is to assign to disk_name earlier and check for None before

Added a csv writer using the 'csv' library to format

Added a HttpResponse-based class to handle csv generation
Added translation for the CSV columns and template.
Improved consistency for exported data - now passing project name
instead of project id for csv export. Also added both project name/id
in the header of a project usage export.

Fix bug #1158383

Renamed few occurencies of 'tenant' to project.

Also added a new 'project' in nova_data.py, which required
some refactoring of few tests, that didn't consider the current project
for project-based calls.

Note: I've added a StreamingHttpResponse example,
which is introduced in Django 1.5+ and  being advised in the ticket.
However, my opinion is that at the moment we don't need this - it is
too complicated for the current usage.

Nova uses root_gb=0 to indicate that we should use the image as-is without
trying to resize the root disk. Currently the xenapi virt-driver doesn't
properly implement this behavior.

This patch gets us a step closer by disabling the VDI size check when
root_gb=0. We still need to ensure that the disk-resize code handle root_gb=0
as well.

Commit c952491 made an incompatible change to MultiConfigParser's
behaviour. The code in Quantum which was relying on the behaviour did
the following:

    p = MultiConfigParser()
    multi_parser.read(conf_file)

    for parsed_file in multi_parser.parsed:
        for section in parsed_file.keys():
            if section.startswith(""CLUSTER:""):
                ...

However, we made a change such that the keys of the 'parsed' dict were
normalized to lowercase. Restore the previous behaviour and add another
dict for tracking the values with normalized section names. We also
add a normalized=False kwarg to the get() method so that we also restore
the previous behaviour of the method by default.

This shows the need to aggressively make implementation details as not
part of the public API of our libraries. In this case, I considered
MultiConfigParser as an implementation detail and that no projects would
be using it. But, sure enough, if it's public then *someone* will use
it.

Also, add a bunch of test cases to actually test the behaviour of this
class in isolation.

This patch add support customizing MTU of networks (currently only
support ovs plugin).

To create a network with specified MTU using the CLI:

   (shell) net-create <net-name> --networkoption:mtu <mtu-value>

To modify a network with specified MTU using the CLI:

   (shell) net-update <net-name> --networkoption:mtu <mtu-value>

We push the MTU value to VM by using dhcp extensions, tested dhcp
clients:

  * isc-dhcp-client: ok
  * udhcpc: not supported

Here we introduced a new quantum extension to set network options,
and planning to add more options (eg dns server, static route).

You can set up a simulated 3 node cluster on the local machine with
following script:

 $ sudo apt-get install liburcu-dev
 $ git clone git://github.com/collie/sheepdog.git
 $ cd sheepdog
 $ ./autogen.sh; ./configure --disable-corosync
 $ make; sudo make install

DocImpact
If account reaper has not managed to clean out an account after a long
period, it prints a message to the log (you can search your system looking
for such messages). Introduce reap_warn_after config variable to determine
when to emit the message (defaults to 30 days).

Also fix bug 1181995 (edge case where object name is an empty string)

The intention is to remain as close as possible to the original
implementation and so leaves a number of easy cleanups and optimisations
until a later patch.

In writing tests their are a number of changes for API tests that are a
result of webob/webtest restrictions:
 * response.body is now the string body and response.result is the parsed
   dictionary.
 * response.status is now a string eg. '200 OK', use
   response.status_code to get the integer
 * response.getheader no longer exists. response.headers is a dictionary
   like object that can be accessed (case independently) with [] or
   .get()

openstack%2Fglance~master~If4125d6bcbde63df95de129ac5c83b4a6d6f130a,openstack/glance,master,,If4125d6bcbde63df95de129ac5c83b4a6d6f130a,Remove gettext.install() from glance/__init__.py,MERGED,2013-04-10 12:57:08.000000000,2013-05-22 22:39:31.000000000,2013-05-22 22:39:30.000000000,1,4,2,26605,d35e558b9347761b31eb311173e57eabe0f2fa4c,20,7,2,2,1247,Mark McLoughlin,markmc,"Remove gettext.install() from glance/__init__.py

The gettext.install() function installs a builtin _() function which
translates a string in the translation domain supplied to the install()
function. If gettext.install() is called multiple times, it's the last
call to the function which wins and the last supplied translation domain
which is used e.g.

 >>> import os
 >>> os.environ['LANG'] = 'ja.UTF-8'
 >>> import gettext
 >>> gettext.install('keystone', unicode=1, localedir='/opt/stack/keystone/keystone/locale')
 >>> print _('Invalid syslog facility')
 無効な syslog ファシリティ
 >>> gettext.install('nova', unicode=1, localedir='/opt/stack/nova/nova/locale')
 >>> print _('Invalid syslog facility')
 Invalid syslog facility

Usually this function is called early on in a toplevel script and we
assume that no other code will call it and override the installed _().
However, in Glance, we have taken a shortcut to avoid having to call it
explicitly from each script and instead call it from glance/__init__.py.

This shortcut would be perfectly fine if we were absolutely sure that
glance modules would never be imported from another program. It's probably
quite incorrect for a program to use glance code (indeed, if we wanted to
support this, Glance code shouldn't use the default _() function) but
nevertheless there are some corner cases where it happens. For example,
the keystoneclient auth_token middleware tries to import cfg from
gance.openstack.common and this in turn causes gettext.install('glance')
to be called in other projects like glance or quantum.

To avoid any doubt here, let's just rip out the shortcut and always
call gettext.install() from the top-level script.

However, there's a bit of an annoying detail here - by default,
nosetests starts in the current directly and tries to import all modules
it finds to look for tests. Without the _() builtin installed, importing
some modules like glance.common.exception will fail.

Since it only ever makes sense to load tests from the glance/tests dir,
we can ask nose to do that by using the --tests argument via setup.cfg.

Note, this means that if you previously did this:

  $> tox -- glance.tests.foo glance.tests.bar

then you must now do this:

  $> tox -- --tests glance.tests.foo,glance.tests.bar

Preserves the default passwords corresponding to the OpenStack Install
and Deploy Manual while allowing environment variables to specify user
provided passwords. As well, a single common password for all the service
users can be specified using the SERVICE_PASSWORD environment variable.

This fix restores compatibility with the version of this script released
in Folsom where the environment variables could override default passwords.
It also preserves compatibility with the fix for bug 1073291 that brought
the script into line with the docs (but unfortunately broke backwards
compatibility).

There is no warning emited if the user does not override the default
passwords as was present in Folsom, but not in Grizzly. This makes the
fix output compatible with Grizzly only. Note that the logic for warnings
pre-Grizzly was unclear. The script is, however, clearly named ""sample""
and warnings are present in the comments.

This patch removes the use of glance-control from the test suite. Instead
of forking out glance-control and letting it fork out the other programs,
we will now fork out the other programs directly. The file which tested
glance-control has also been removed. While we will still have
glance-control as part of the distribution for a bit and thus it should
still be tested, that test was doing so in a way that depended upon the
forking behavior previously found in the test suite.

This patch also requires the patch
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/26076/ on which it is dependent. As a
side effect it tests for the problem found in bug: 1068051

Additionally, this fixes a race condition. Previously each functional
test called cleanup() in tearDown(). Cleanup would open a pid file and
send a SIGTERM to the processes (api, registry, scrubber). However,
it did not wait for this process to die and get cleaned up. The signal
handler in the processes is over ridden so the death is not instant.
This leaves a chance for server from a previous test to be actively
listening on a port when the next test starts.

Bug 1172537

In order to avoif 414 the list subnet requests will be split in
multiple requests. The total URI len for each of these requests
will be lower than 8K (the default maximum for eventlet.wsgi.server).
The patch tries to submit a single request, and if the URI is too
long an exception is raised before the request is sent over the
wire; the exception handler will split the subnet id list, and
submit the new requests.

This patch does not address the case in which the server is
configured with a maximum URI length different from 8K.

Fixes bug 1174593

VLAN IDs in the range 1006-4094 are considered to be in the extended
range by the Cisco Nexus 3K switch. As such, the 3K rejects any
state change configuration commands for VLANs in this range, including
""state active"" and ""no shutdown"". The errors returned by the 3K for
these commands can be ignored, since the default states for these commands
are acceptable for the 3K.

For the 5K and 7K versions of the Nexus switch, on the other hand, the
""state active"" and ""no shutdown"" commands are required for proper VLAN
configuration, regardless of VLAN ID.

This fix splits the configuration commands which are used to create a
VLAN on the Nexus switch into three separate configurations:
  - VLAN creation
  - state active
  - no shutdown
For the ""state active"" and ""no shutdown"" configurations, the Cisco Nexus
plugin will tolerate (ignore) errors involving invalid setting of state
for VLANs in the extended VLAN range. These specific errors can be
identified by looking for the appearance of certain signature strings
in the associated exception's message string, i.e. ""Can't modify
state for extended"" or ""Command is allowed on VLAN"".

This approach will yield a very small hit in performance, but the solution
is much less error prone than requiring customers to configure the
Cisco plugin for 3K vs. 5K vs. 7K, or perhaps even specific software
versions of the 3K, in order to inform the Cisco plugin whether
VLAN state configuration commands should be used or not.

This patch adds support for mount options for NFS/GlusterFS volumes.

To set options, append them to the line for the volume in the
nfs_shares_config or glusterfs_shares_config file:
 192.168.175.166:/testvol -o backupvolfile-server=192.168.175.177
 host1:/testvol2 -o backupvolfile-server=host2,rw,other_option

These options are used when mounting from the cinder-volume
service and the nova-compute service.  (There is an associated
nova-compute patch to enable the same.)

This is a useful change for GlusterFS because the
backupvolfile-server option enables a mount to succeed even if
the first server specified is offline.

  raises new LibvirtNotAvailableException.

As instances are soft deleted, instance data may still be
    available in the database. This feature allows users to
    retrieve this data if it's available. As it is implemented
    as a policy, it can be restricted to only certain users/roles.

When enabled, a show call on a deleted instance will return
    what data is available instead of a 404 Not Found. If the
    soft deleted data is purged from the database, a 404 Not Found
    will be returned to the user.

When disabled, a show call on a deleted instance will maintain
    it's normal behavior, thus returning a 404 Not Found.

The proxy server now is made aware of its location by the configuration
setting ""region"" if this is not set changes dont affect the behaviour.
The affinity is useful for when two regions exist which have a high latency.
When the region is set to ""2"", the proxy pushes all nodes which are in the
region 2 to the top and are thus tried first.

Usecase:
Region 1: Asia
Region 2: Europe
Proxy in Europe

Default behaviour is that a random node is selected. Thus sometimes the
proxy selects the asian server. This causes latencies and not needed inter-
continental traffic.

This started as a small re-importation from the ""big"" LFS into the
DB broker level. Note that the existing GlusterFS UFO code does
not need this, because its initialize() is empty. So the checks
fail all over the place silently. However, when I wrote a ""posix fs""
stub plugin, I had containers as directories and thus did not have
the ""db_file"". Also, I ran the tests which split the difference
between 204 and 201 being returned.

This version of the patch switches db_file to _db_file to illustrate
its ""internal"" nature. However, this seems like opening a whole
bunch of questions like what to do with db_type?

The .is_good() wrapper is simply called .exists() in a parallel
patch for MD5 deconflicting. We kept this as it seems a better fit.

This patch does NOT do anything about _get_xxxx_brocker(), because
it does not buy us much. If it were possible to get rid of it, then
it would be good, but as it is, GlusterFS relies on it to hook.
Therefore it seems pointless to attack it. The best we could do
is to make it an empty trampoline to the broker.

Thus conf files are backwards compatible but option group references

In the process of switching option group names to lowercase in Quantum,
we've confronted a chicken egg problem where root_helper is defined in 'agent'
but devstack executes iniset root_helper on 'AGENT'.

https://review.openstack.org/#/c/29738/

To have the above patch merge, there are two options,
1) Have oslo.config be case insensitive to group names.
2) Add a iniset to 'agent' in devstack while keeping iniset on 'AGENT'
   until above patch merges.

Option 1) is not possible since oslo.config is fixed to v1.1.0 and cores
only wish to have backward compatibility on conf files and not on how we
reference the option group in the code.
Option 2) seems to be the only solution to have review 29738 pass while
keeping compatibility with other quantum patches for the time being.

Therefore this patch adds an iniset on 'agent' above each iniset on 'AGENT'

This patch applies a reverse SNAT rule to allow instances that have an
assigned floating IP to communicate with other instances in the same
OpenStack deployment, security group rules permitting. The patch
allows members of the same private network to communicate with each
other using their floating-ips in a more consistent fashion. The rule
also addresses the situation where the target is on another private
network.

This will only work for interaction between two servers that both have
floating IPs assigned to them.

Specifically, this patch solves the problem where a target server
""sees"" the private address of the client. By SNAT'ing to the client's
floating-IP, the ""sees"" the correct reply address and the reverse
route follows the same path that an actual external connection would
take. The SNAT ONLY occurs if a DNAT occurred before hand, allowing
communication on private networks using private IPs to remain fully
private and internal. The limitation is of course if a DNAT occurs for
other reasons, there may be issues.

If you have StatsD logging turned on, then the iterator returned by
Ring.get_part_nodes() will emit StatsD packets when it yields a
handoff node. That network IO may make eventlet trampoline to another
greenthread before returning from next(). Now, if that other
greenthread tries to call next() on that same iterator, it blows up
with a ValueError.

Any socket IO inside a generator's next() method can cause this. It's
easiest to reproduce with StatsD logging turned on, but logging to
syslog can trigger it too.

You can see this happen sometimes in the proxy's make_requests method
if two of the primary nodes are down. Greenthread A goes into next()
to get a handoff node, then sends a StatsD packet, and so eventlet
trampolines to Greenthread B. Now, Greenthread B also calls next() to
get a handoff node, and dies with a ValueError.

This commit wraps up concurrently-accessed iter_nodes() iterators in a
new thing called a GreenthreadSafeIterator that serializes access.

provided in the python-jinja2 package on CentOS 6, and since nova's

Because requests is actually a dependency of python-cinderclient but
is only breaking nova's unit tests, it has to be added and come
before python-cinderclient in the pip-requires list. A separate
change has been proposed to openstack/requirements which will need

This patch contains two minor edits to the
quantum::agents::ovs code.

1. allow setting of the firewall_driver.

This code ensures that the firewall driver can be
either set to its default of IptablesFirewallDriver
or unset (which we believe is required in the case
of compute nodes with gre enabled)

2. explicitly remove tunneling configuration when
it is not being used. This is part of an ongoing
attempt to clean up configuration that are not
currently in use.

This patch also adds tests to verify the proposed
code.

This patch fixes a race condition where the user gets a token, uses it
to delete an instance, and immediately deletes the token before 
quantum can use it to clean up the network associated with the 
instance. Note that in this scenario the user is not waiting for the 
instance to be completely deleted before deleting the token that is 
passed to quantum.

The v1 API is on the deprecation path, so should not require
that distros have all its dependencies available.

Thus we add a new configuration option to allow the v1 app
creation to be suppressed.

This change falls back on publicURL if the adminURL is not found in
the service catalog.  This change maintains the historic default
behavior of using 'adminURL' if it is there.

Also, adds a new exception type to handle the case where a suitable
endpoint type is not found in the catalog.  Without this, the
exception encountered is a KeyError that is not accurately reported to
the caller of the quantum command line.

Added unit tests for the url_for method of the Service Catalog which
trigger the problem with the previous code base and pass with this
proposed fix.
