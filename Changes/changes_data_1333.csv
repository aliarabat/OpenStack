The ml2 plugin uses mechanism drivers to determine which network
segment and what VIF driver to use for a port. Mechanism drivers
supporting the openvswitch, linuxbridge, and hyperv agents are
added. The binding:host attribute is set on ports belonging to the
dhcp and l3 agents so that they can be bound.

To use with devstack until it is updated, set
""Q_ML2_PLUGIN_MECHANISM_DRIVERS=openvswitch,linuxbridge"" in localrc.

The hyperv L2 agent does not currently implement the agents_db RPC,
and will therefore not work with its ml2 mechanism driver. This issue
will be tracked as a bug to be fixed in a separate merge.

Add the get_unix_user(), get_unix_group(), set_permissions(),
make_dirs() utilities to keystone/common/utils.py. These functions are
much more robust and flexible. Ownership can be specifed either with
symbolic names or explicit id's. Any value you do not want to override
can be passed as None and it will be skipped.

The BaseCertificateConfigure class in openssl.py had it's own code to
create directories, set ownership, set permissions, etc. which was
used for setting up certificates, key files, etc. Properly handling
file system objects should not be a property of openssl, rather these
should be general utilities which can be used in a variety of
locations. Plus the openssl versions were not fully general and had
some pecular limitations. The new utilies will be used in a subsequent
patch which also needs this functionality but isn't in openssl code.

Previously the openssl code was inconsistent as to whether it set the
ownership and permissions, sometimes ownership and permission was set
only if the file/dir did not exist, other times the ownership and
permission were set irregardless of prior existence. The modified code
now always sets ownerhip and permissions (if provided).

The prior code assumed an id (uid/gid) was being passed for ownership,
but this was not documented. The code appears to take a symbolic
name. The cli code converted symbolic names passed on the command line
to id's before instantiating a class which accepts ownership
information. If you instantiated one of the class without first
converting a name to an id it would throw an exception. The new
utilities accept either symbolic names or id's and since these
utilities are now used internally you can pass either a name or id and
one is no longer dependent upon special handling inside cli argument
parsing code to get correct behavior with these classes.

There were several places with code like this:

    os.chown(file_name, self.use_keystone_user or -1,
             self.use_keystone_group or -1)

The intent would appear to be to avoid setting the uid or gid if the
attribute had a value of None. Except this fails completely if the
uid or gid belongs to root because those id's are zero, thus the code
would never work with root id's. The new utilities explicitly test for
a value of None and do not rely on the weak ""truth test"".

Note: these new utilities are intended to be moved into oslo-incubator
in the near future.

This is a final patch from series of patches improving EC2 error
responses that makes finishing touches.

Useless EC2APIError exception is finally annihilated. Nova exceptions
that were raised outside of EC2 API are now translated to appropriate
EC2 error codes using ec2_code attribute.

With EC2 exceptions fixed, HTTP status code corresponding to raised
exception is now returned instead of previously hardcoded 400. All
expected exceptions are treated as client errors and returned with 4xx
HTTP status code for compatibility with EC2 API.

Unexpected exceptions are now always logged on ERROR log level, CRITICAL
wasn't really appropriate.

Following valid EC2 error codes were added to existing exceptions
eliminating the need to translate them explicitly:

 * InvalidKeypair.ec2_code = 'InvalidKeyPair.Format'
 * KeyPairExists.ec2_code = 'InvalidKeyPair.Duplicate'
 * QuotaError.ec2_code = 'ResourceLimitExceeded'
   (*LimitExceeded exceptions inherit from QuotaError)

Exceptions caught in Executor were reordered for better readability.

create_thin_pool is setting vg_thin_pool to the pool path instead of the
pool_name. This makes volumes creation fail when the create_thin_pool
method is called. This happens because create_volume builds the pool
path itself as create_thin_pool does.

Keeping the pool name in vg_thin_pool instead of the path makes more
sense and allows it to be used in other places in the brick. Also, most
commands return both vg_name and pool_name separated.

This implements volume_snapshot_create and volume_snapshot_delete
methods which create snapshots of QCOW2-based Cinder volumes.

The update_snapshot_status API from cinderclient is used to
inform Cinder of the result of these operations.

This feature requires a minimum libvirt version of 1.1.1 due
to a bug in libvirt BlockJobInfo handling in earlier versions.

* adds support for multiple plugin drivers for loadbalancer
* cleans up healthmonitor-related plugin driver API

simple tiny wrapper of a dictionary, but future plans include
rewriting it using persistence API and adding more sophisticated

This change adds the basic patterns and a very simple engine that
is able to run flow defined with patterns by converting it to recursive

Fixes bug 1220296

The ML2 plugin's type and mechanism managers currently maintain
dictionaries/lists of type drivers, mechanism drivers, and ordered mechanism
drivers in (static) class variables. Once a type/mechanism/ordered-mechanism
driver of any given type is added to this list, then no new drivers of that
type are allowed to be registered, and therefore no new configuration for
that driver type is accepted.

This static nature of the driver dictionaries/lists is causing ML2 mechanism
driver unit test cases to fail. For example, if a non-vendor-specific ML2
plugin test case configures a VLAN type driver with no VLAN range, and then
a vendor specific test case attempts to configure a VLAN type driver with
some test VLAN range, then the new VLAN configuration is ignored because of
the previously (staticly) registered VLAN driver.

The proposed fix is to convert these driver dictionaries/lists to instance
variables, and clear them upon each instantiation of an ML2 type manager
or ML2 mechanism manager.

New InternalError exception with 'InternalError' ec2_code attribute was
introduced for the case of timeout when waiting for instance to stop
because there is no fitting existing exception.

InternalError is a valid EC2 error code. Unlike the other implemented
error codes, it's a server error with 500 status code. For that reason,
it's not listed as an expected error in the Executor and thus it's
treated as an unexpected error - it's logged as ERROR and returned
with 500 status code. That is a wanted behaviur because this shouldn't
ever happen and if it does, it should be visible.

'UnsupportedOperation' ec2_code attribute was added to following

Previously, only True and False were supported. This change allows an
administrator to specify which images should reject any user requests
for DiskConfig=AUTO, i.e. reject the request to automatically resize
that instance's root disk.

To specify that an image's disk can't be resized, add the following
property to the image:
auto_disk_config=disabled

In addition, when uploading a snapshot we need to ensure that if
auto_disk_config is ""disabled"", that property is inherited by any
snapshot. Currently, the disk_config from the database, which is always
False in the case of ""disabled"", would be persisted instead. When
auto_disk_config is not ""disabled"", then the current True or False value
for that server should continue to be persisted in any snapshot, and not
the value stored in the source image for that server.

Blueprint: hyper-v-wmi-v2

The Hyper-V APIs are mainly based on WMI. The original 2008 Hyper-V
release introduced the ""root\virtualization"" namespace which got
superseded in Hyper-V Server / Windows Server 2012 by the
""root\virtualization\v2"" namespace (referred as V2 in the sources).

Features introduced in 2012, including as an example live migration
and VHDX support are available via the V2 namespace only.

Furthermore, the original namespace has been dropped in the upcoming
Hyper-V 2012 R2 (currently available in preview), which means that
the Grizzly code will not be compatible with it as is.

The Hyper-V driver is structured with a clear decoupling between OS
interaction classes (so called *utils modules and classes) and the
driver's business logic (e.g.: *ops modules and classes).

This allows us to provide an implementation of the V2 API without
impacting the rest of the driver's code, based on the previously
included utilsfactory module to instantiate the proper version of
the *utils classes: the original ""V1"" ones for versions of the OS
predating 2012 and the newer ""V2"" ones starting from Hyper-V 2012
(Windows kernel version 6.2).

Hyper-V previous V1 APIs can be forced by setting the following option
in the hyperv section to true. The default is false.

force_hyperv_utils_v1=false

Unit tests have been added for the relevant factory functions.

run run_tests.sh or tox to test the glance code, it will get
following failure:
test_get_bind_addr_default_value
test_get_path_non_exist

Analysis
--------
The root cause is resided in ""glance/tests/unit/api/test_cmd.py"".
In TestGlanceApiCmd.setUp, the sys.argv is overrided to ['glance-api'].
Since sys.argv is ""global"" variable, and this test entry it run
firstly by nosetests while running tests in ""glance/tests/unit""(since
nosetests search test items alphabetically), the other test entries
will inherit the sys.argv value ['glance-api']. Finally the system
config file ""/etc/glance/glance-api.conf"" is read in ""setUp"" via
oslo.config.cfg:ConfigOpts.__call__ -> _pre_setup -> find_config_files.
CONF.bind_port and CONF.bind_host is set to the value reading from
system config file: /etc/glance/glance-api.conf.

A simplied call backtrace:
TestGlanceApiCmd.setUp -->  sys.argv = ['glance-api']
 ->JSONRequestDeserializerTest.setUp
  ->glance/common/config.py:parse_args
   ->oslo.config.cfg:ConfigOpts.__call__
    ->CONF.bind_port CONF.bind_host is set

wsgi.get_bind_addr() will read the CONF.bind_port and CONF.bind_host
to return value. if system config file is not read, CONF.bind_host
is set to ""0.0.0.0"", CONF.bind_port is not set. wsgi.get_bind_addr()
will return the expected value. This is the reason that individual
test of test_get_bind_addr_default_value got passed, but failed while
testing all.

The failure of test_get_path_non_exist is induced by same reason.

Test case should clear up the setting in tearDown(), especially the
""global"" setting, e.g. sys.argv.

Solution
--------
The solution is simple:
In class TestGlanceApiCmd, add a private variable to backup the
sys.argv in setUp(), and restore it in tearDown().

Test method
-----------
$ ./run_tests.sh

$ tox -evenv -- nosetests \
--tests=glance.tests.unit.common.test_config:TestPasteApp

tox -evenv -- nosetests
--tests=glance.tests.unit.common.test_wsgi:JSONRequestDeserializerTest

fix bug #1180779

VMware nova compute drivers VMwareESXDriver and VMwareVCDriver
currently report stats for the column local_gb in MB instead of in GB
The fix would be to modify vmwareapi/host.py to ensure the values
reported for disk space are calculated in GB instead of MB.
Fix is done by further dividing the existing MB value by 1024 to
convert to GB.
The unit tests to check for capacity and freespace have been modified
to check for GB.

This is the initial patch for the new extension framework to be used
by the Nova v3 API. It will only be used by v3 API extensions
and not v2 API extensions. v3 API extensions will only use this plugin
framework and will not be compatible with the old one.

- Sets up a /v3 url prefix
- Looks in an entry point namespace of nova.api.extensions
- The fixed_ips extensions is ported to /v3 as an example of
  a resource extensions. Required changes are very minor.
- All extensions must derive from the V3APIExtensionBase class
- Drops updated field from extensions, replaced with version field
- Ports tests for fixed_ips extension
- None of the core has been ported in this patch, though
  the example extension works without it. The intent is
  to port the core code over as plugins as well. There will still
  be a conceptual core however I don't think we need a separate directory
  for core.

This is the first of a series of patches to add support for the
new extension framework. Future direction including support
for controller extensions, removal of extension code in core
code etc can be seen here:

Some notes about the change:

 - each of heat-api, heat-api-cfn, heat-api-cloudwatch has indvidual
   options for bind_port, bind_host
 - heat-engine options live under DEFAULT (it does not bind to any
   ports)
 - new log_dir global
 - slight fixes to ENCRYPTION_KEY generation for new heat.conf name
 - include rspec tests for api-cfn & api-cloudwatch

Partial-Bug 1219991

This change modifies the hook processing for dict_extend routines
to call the method on the instance if a hook is registered as a string.
Otherwise, the callable hook is directly invoked as an unbound method.

This patch fixes hook registration for all extensions except port_binding.
This is because some plugins are currently working around this limitation
by invoking both the global hook and another dict_extend function,
which might either be registered as another hook, or invoked explicitly
before returning the response.
Fixing this would go beyong the scope of this patch.

This patch makes rpc calls that are the result of booting an instance
propagate the new block device mapping format.

The way this is done is by adding a 'legacy_bdm' flag to the conductor
(task) API. Since both the scheduler and the compute service propagate
the block device mapping as part of the request_spec field, a flag named
legacy_bdm_in_spec to indicate that was introduced in their respective
APIs.

Currently block_device_mapping is not used by any of the in-tree filters
in the scheduler, so it is assumed that scheduler's boot functionality
has now transitioned to the new format.

This patch also bumps RPC versions of the task, scheduler and compute
manager classes.

Finally this patch propagates the legacy_bdm_in_spec through the
run_instance callback of the compute manager so that, in case of error -
the instance is re-scheduled with the proper flag set.

the check before run the test:

The brick exceptions tend to make an incorrect
assumption that the exceptions from the executor
will be of class processutils.ProcessExecutionError.

This may or may not be true because we pass in an
executor which is most likely going to be the wrapped
putils executor from cinder/utils.py.  The result here
is that we almost never actually catch exceptions.

This change fixes that by making a generic except, and
then takes that exception and extracts things like
stdout, stderr and the attempted cmd and builds a
brick exception of type LVMCommandExecutionFailure
w/ the above mentioned attributes when possible.

This only fixes the issue in the LVM module!

The other modules in brick will need addressed,
in addition, this points out that the calling driver
has never been catching these exceptions.  They
were typically handled by the manager, but now we need
to do some work to clean things up in task flows.

drivers. For that's a huge change, we break the codes into
three patches:
1.Refactor T iSCSI driver
2.Refactor Dorado iSCSI driver
3.Add FC drivers for both T and Dorado arrays.

This is the first patch, changes as follows:
1.Define a common class for both FC and iSCSI drivers, and
also provide a unified class HuaweiVolumeDriver for users.
The unified driver will call HuaweiTISCSIDriver according to
users' configuration. The HuaweiTISCSIDriver is a subclass of
driver.ISCSIDriver, so it could get good inheritance.
2.Support volume type.
3.Refactor unit test to make it more logic clear and add more
test cases to get higher coverage rate.

This commit fixes the following bugs which are detected by moving

* Raise CommandError instead of Value/KeyError in VPN parameter
  validation (Closes-Bug: #1219192)

* Delete dpd_timeout_less_than_interval test in IPsec site
  connection tests.  CLI does not validate this and it raises
  ConnectionError and results in the test failure.
  (Previously this test catches a general Exception,
   so the unit test does not fail unexpectedly.)
  (Closes-Bug: #1219389)

  There is a confusion on whether dpd_timeout == dpd_interval
  should be accepted in server side code, document and CLI.
  it is important to make VPN related tests enabled, so I decided
  to leave the fix of validation logic in the future work.

The baremetal driver tries 5 times in 2.5 seconds to shut off the power
to a device under its control. However, it may take longer than 2.5
seconds to make the power state change on some older hardware, resulting
in an InstancePowerOffFailure exception being raised before the device
has powered down.  The exception triggers a bug in nova-compute that
prevents further power-state syncing: nova-compute never sees the
shutdown complete, and the instance becomes wedged executing the current
task (bug 1212420).

This patch attempts to work around the slow power-off issue by
increasing the default number of IPMI power state polling attempts from
5 to 20, thus increasing the shutdown grace period from 2.5 seconds to
10 seconds.  The changed setting is used in the IPMI driver's
_power_on and _power_off methods.

As a side effect this change also increases the power-on grace period by
the same amount.

When nova uses neutron-client and the client needs to authenticate with
keystone it will additionally retrieve the service-catalog. The client will
then ignore the provided endpoint_url parameter given to it during
instantiation because the service-catalog retrieval process overrides that
parameter.

Using the endpoint declared in the service-catalog even though the endpoint is
given is unexpected given the precedent set by glance-client to respect that
parameter. Ensuring the parameter is used will allow users to override the
identity's catalog. This is useful if identity is in error, or if the user is
using a special development configuration.

Unit tests are included to test that said functionality occurs.

Making ec2token middleware multi-cloud aware presents a
challenge as the API assumes there is only one cloud and
Heat must remain compatible. This means that unlike multi-cloud
heat-api, the request cannot explicitly say which endpoint it
wants to authenticate against.

However it must be possible to make authenticated cfn requests
against a multi-cloud heat for the sake of cfntools requests.

The approach taken in this commit is to attempt authentication
against each configured allowed_auth_uris until one succeeds.

This is safe for the following reasons:
1. AWSAccessKeyId is a randomly generated sequence
2. No secret is transferred to validate a request

If all auth attempts fail, the last failed reason is raised
as the error to the user.

Fixes bug 1208680

As what the code owner of method 'finish_migration' in libvirt driver
said, the files injecting operation is not necessary during resize,
because they have already been injected when creating the instance,
so added a parameter to _create_image to fix this issue, which is used
for identifying the injection is needed or not.

configured number of attempts.

This should help operators diagnose issues on devices that respond
slowly to IPMI commands.  The failure to repeatedly change the device
power state is now logged precisely along with the cause, where
before operators had to diagnose the issue through trace log captures.

CONF.vlan_start + num_existing_networks + index_of_requested_network
- If the above vlan is in use, try to get the next free vlan.

In investigating performance of the test_xenapi unit testing I
discovered that about 25% of the time is spent in FakeVirtAPI.instance_update.
This function in turn calls db.instance_update_and_get_original to note changes
in state during spawn for most of the unit testing in XenAPIVMTestCase.

XenAPIVMTestCase, doesn't ever check/verify the updating of db based on spawning
of instances.  As such this is wasted effort which can be eliminated since that
verificaiton is not the intent of the tests from what I can gather.

In my testing this reduced running times from 19-20 seconds down to 14-15 seconds
with all unit tests still succeeding. test_xenapi is the by and far the largest
offender in xenapi tests.  Overall xenapi tests we're reduce from
21-22 seconds to 16-17 seconds.

when trying to debug test failures because it provides you with a

Checked all cases of re-raised exceptions. In several cases, the exception
was redundant (re-raising the same exception), so the try block and
exception handling was removed.

In one case, exceptions raised from two sources were re-raised with a
a different exception. Instead of doing this, the original exceptions
were changed and the try block and re-raised exception were removed.

In cases where there were database exceptions that were re-raised as
Neutron exceptions, the traceback was left as-is, since it was more
informative to know the higher level source of the issue.

The same was true for the exception mentioned in the bug, where the
original failure was in the ncclient library parsing the configuration
and it would be more descriptive to know that there was a connection
failure or a config failure, that to know the library method.

This modification adds support for volume type encryption to
python-cinderclient, supporting two Cinder API extensions.

The first support set provides accessors to python-cinderclient for
retrieving volume encryption metadata from Cinder. These changes
provide other services (e.g., Nova) access to encryption
metadata (e.g., encryption key UUIDs). See the volume encryption
key API extension in Cinder for more information.

The second support set creates a new python-cinderclient resource
manager, along with matching shell commands, that provides creation
and accessor operations for encryption type information. These
operations allow users and services to define encryption information
(e.g., cipher, key size, encryption provider) for a pre-existing
volume type. See the volume type encryption API extension in Cinder
for more information.

There is a race condition where change_instance_metdata requests still
get to the compute nodes when the VM has a task in operation that means
the VM is no longer present. This change ensures that we skip the
metadata updates when this occurs.

Currently, if this happens, the long running task, like rebuild or
resize will fail because the VM task_state=None and is put into ERROR.
After this change, it will silently fail, and the updated metadata will
be written when the VM gets re-created as part of the long running
operation.

For the following VPNaaS attributes, ensure that these validation
tests are performed in the extension:

    keepalive >= 60 (seconds)
    mtu >= 0 (octets)
    DPD interval > 0 (seconds)
    DPD timeout > 0 (seconds)

Currently, the units for keepalive can only be seconds. If this
changes in the future (e.g. to allow kilobytes units), then the
test for the value will need to be changed.

To correctly test the MTU limits for an IPSec connection, the
protocol must be taken into consideration, which is defined by
the vpnservice object. Because of this dependency, we cannot
validate this in the extension, and will instead, just make
sure the value is positive.

Likewise, the attribute validators cannot ensure that the
DPD timeout is greater than the interval (again, because the
validators can only check the individual attributes one at
a time).

The range validator was modified to allow single ended ranges
for some of these attributes. The range also ensures the value
is an integer.

Companion changes are being made in the CLI code for these limit
changes.

Update: Fixed typo causing tox failure.

Bug 1209242

nova-api has supported pagination for long. A marker and limit
option could be passed to nova-api to get a slice of instances.
It makes sense to enable this feature in novaclient, so that
horizon could use it for pagination supporting. Modification to
shell.py would be submitted in a separate patch.

Further change will also pass 'sort_key' and 'sort_dir' to
nova-api, as long as nova supports this.

It is possible to clone a volume with a size greater than
the source volume. When using the SolidFire driver, the volume size
was not passed in the call made to the SolidFire API when
cloning a volume.

It resulted in a cloned volume having the same size as the source
volume but the correct size in the Cinder database.

This changes makes sure the cloned volume has the correct size
by explicitly passing the requested size when calling
the SolidFire API and cloning the volume.

Validate that, when creating rules specifying a protocol different
from TCP, UDP, ICMP and ICMPv6, no port (range) is specified because
NVP does not like it.

The extra validation is specific to the NVP plugin because other
plugins may choose a different failure mode. For example, the ovs
plugin does not complain at all, but it just ignores the port range
if the protocol is not a port-oriented one.

Mitchell,klmitch,"xenapi: Create a ghost when deleting an instance

The XenAPI has to scrub the memory used by an instance after deleting
it.  This imposes a delay--variable on the size of the instance and
the speed of the hypervisor host--before that memory can be reused.
To account for the memory being unavailable, this change causes the
virt driver to return a Ghost when an instance is destroyed.  The
expiration time is computed using a simple linear equation, with the
size of the instance memory, in megabytes, being the variable.  The
constants of this equation are set through the configuration options
xenapi_ghost_constant and xenapi_ghost_multiplier, and the expiration
time for the ghost is computed as:

    expire = xenapi_ghost_constant + memory_mb * xenapi_ghost_multiplier

where ""memory_mb"" is the size of the instance's memory allocation in
megabytes.  The defaults for the configuration options are chosen to
compute one second per gigabyte plus a constant half-second overhead.
As the ghost mechanism is a best-effort mechanism, these defaults
should be sufficient, but they are made configurable for tuning.

Mitchell,klmitch,"Add tracking of instance ghosts

With some virt drivers, deletion of an instance does not immediately
release the resources formerly used by that instance; the virt layer
instead must perform some scrubbing for security purposes, which
may take some time.  This change adds the concept of a ""ghost"" to
nova-compute: a ""ghost"" is an object which holds the resources
formerly held by the deleted instance until a given expiration time.
A ghost may be returned by the virt driver's destroy() method, in
place of the default None return value.

Ghosts are not persisted to the database; they represent a best-
effort mechanism to prevent scheduling an instance to a host which
may not yet have made the vacated resources available.  Should a
ghost be lost, and a compute node fail to create an instance as a
consequence, the normal rescheduling mechanism should suffice to
ensure the instance is created.

Partially implements blueprint ghosts.

In _allocate_fixed_ips() and setup_networks_on_host(), we spawn off
green threads to call _rpc_allocate_fixed_ip() and
rpc_setup_network_on_host() on remote network managers, but if there is
an exception in the thread it just gets swallowed.

We don't really need a GreenPool here. It's not like its limit of 1000
threads is relevant here. Just use eventlet.spawn(), collect the list of
threads spawned and call wait() on each of them. This will ensure the
exception gets raised by wait().

Also, fix a case in the v3 integrated servers test where we are setting
up fake networks which are associated with a non-existent 'fake-mini'
host. See also I9854863bbec8834c638c55832411f63da570f82d.

Based upon the keystone caching (using dogpile.cache) implementation
token caching is implemented in this patchset.

This patchset inclues basic Token caching as the first implementation
of this caching layer.  The following methods are cached:
    * token_api.get_token,
    * token_api.list_revoked_tokens
    * token_provider_api.validate_v3_token
    * token_provider_api.check_v3_token
    * token_provider_api.check_v2_token
    * token_provider_api.validate_v2_token
    * token_provider_api.validate_token

Calls to token_api.delete_token and token_api.delete_tokens will
properly invalidate the cache for the tokens being acted upon, as
well as invalidating the cache for the revoked_tokens_list and the
validate/check token calls.

Token caching is configurable independantly of the revocation_list
caching.

Lifted expiration checks from the token drivers to the token manager.
This ensures that cached tokens will still raise TokenNotFound when
expired.

For cache consistency, all token_ids are transformed into the short
token hash at the provider and token_driver level. Some methods would
have access to the full ID (PKI Tokens), and some methods would not.
Cache invalidation is inconsistent without token_id normalization.

There has been a bug open for a while pointing out that the way we
create direct exchanges with qpid results in leaking exchanges since
qpid doesn't support auto-deleting exchanges.  This was somewhat
mitigated by change to use a single reply queue.  This meant we created
far fewer direct exchanges, but the problem persists anyway.

A Qpid expert, William Henry, originally proposed a change to address
this issue.  Unfortunately, it wasn't backwards compatible with existing
installations.  This patch takes the same approach, but makes it
optional and off by default.  This will allow a migration period.

As a really nice side effect, the Qpid experts have told us that this
change will also allow us to use Qpid broker federation to provide HA.

It is possible to have an image with both the xenapi agent and
cloud-init present, or an alternative agent that makes use of metadata
to configure a server.

To ensure the agent will not clash with the ssh key and file injection
of the agent, I have added image properties so we can disable these
agent operations on a per image basis.

The image properties this new code looks for are:
xenapi_skip_agent_inject_ssh=true

Change Ieaf256a5c0f54804686318d6cbd5877a5003c9eb made the powervm driver
plug_vifs method raise NotImplementedError rather than pass, which is
what the hyper-v and vmware drivers do for plug_vifs. This results in
the compute manager failing to init the host because it's not catching
NotImplementedError from driver.plug_vifs.

This patch simply changes the powervm driver plug_vifs method back to
the old behavior (pass), but at least logs a debug message this time.

Currently there is no mechanism to maintain/synchronize more then 1
HostManager(HostState) in the system.
In order to support multiple active schedulers this class has to be a
singleton, this way each scheduler instance will hold a reference to the
same HostManager.

Required for implementation of blueprint multiple-scheduler-drivers.
