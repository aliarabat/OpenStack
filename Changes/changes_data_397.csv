This was originally part of [1] but it was decided to split it out in

resources while we wait for other projects that have neutron-grenade job
in their zuul configurations to approve it's removal.

This is a follow up to change Idf6e548d725db0181629a451f46b6a3a5850d186
where the compute API started lazy-loading the SchedulerReportClient
because of slow startup times, presumably because of the locking
when creating SchedulerReportClient.

The lock on SchedulerReportClient._create_client is removed
since there is no clear indication that it is necessary. It was
added in change I02ac615dc26a4a0d1fd28a638f622777e41d14e4 as a
precaution:

  ""I've made the _client method synchronized so that in the unlikely event
   that the resource tracker is trying to do its update job while some
   other thing is happening, we won't waste the client. This may not be
   necessary, but probably doesn't harm anything.""

Long-term we could consider making SchedulerReportClient a global
singleton so a TODO is left for that since it would require inspecting
cache-sensitive methods to see if a lock is necessary.

os-resource-classes is a library within the nova project that provides
standard symbols for resource classes used by the placement service and
clients thereof. It is very similar to the os-traits library, on which
this file is based.

The library currently uses nova's launchpad, as it's expected to have
few bugs because it has no behaviors, just symbols.

Eventually it will be a part of the placement project, when the
separation is complete.

When a subnet's enable_dhcp attribute is updated, we must restart
dhcp device. So,when we decide whether 'restart' or
'reload_allocations' in refresh_dhcp_helper function we only compare
the cidr of subnets which enabled dhcp.

The previous logic only calls 'restart' when deleting or adding a
subnet. This may cause the dhcp port not updated when the subnet's
enable_dhcp is updated to True.

Previously, when a network name is an empty string,
network information of server interfaces will be empty,
so we cannot distinguish server interfaces.

Also network name in the instance detail page is capitalized
but there is no need to capitalize it and such information like
network name should be displayed as-is. This is not directly
related to the bug fixed by this commit, but it is simple enough
and related to network name, so I believe it is okay.

For the Solidfire cinder driver when volume extend is called on a volume
that has a qos with scaledIOPs=True, the values scaleMin, scaleMax,
scaleBurst are ignored, thus when a volume grows the iops values stay
the same when they should either grow or shrink.

To correct the bug _retrieve_qos_setting has a new argument size with a
default value of zero. This allows all previous calls to function
properly, and saved duplicating code.

Extend volume now calls _retrive_qos_settings with the new size argument
and then includes that qos with the call to solidfire api  ModifyVolume.

radvd needs to run as root, but has the capability to drop privileges on
linux hosts. Currently, radvd process is not using this feature and
this can be considered a serious risk.

In addition, some distributions like SUSE, radvd process runs as a non
privileged user by default, causing radvd failure to daemonize
because it can't write the pid in the corresponding neutron folder and
break the IPv6 functionality.

This patch allows radvd process to run with the same user used by
neutron. In order to allow this, it changes the radvd config file
permissions to 444 because radvd doesn't allow that this file can be
writeable by self/group. The readonly mode is not a problem updating the
file because of the way the neutron_lib replace_file function handles
the files operations.

This commit introduces a framework for policy-in-code support
in the neutron stadium and converts the existing policy.json
in the neutron repository into the policy-in-code style.

NOTES:
1) This commit tries not to change the existing policy behavior
provided by the neutron repository even if there are some stale policies
or policies to be defined in a neutron-related project.
They should be clean up later in Stein release.

2) 'default' policy should be dropped from the default policies
as all default policies should be defined in the code (as many projects
which already completed policy-in-code do). However, dropping 'default'
policy potentially affects policy behavior in neutron-related projects,
so it needs to be visit carefully. Considering this, this commit decides
to keep the 'default' policy.

Some L3 ports can directly modify the IP address now,
but there are some types of device_owner, for instance
network:router_centralized_snat, should not allow to
change the IP address, otherwise it will increase L3
agent code complexity.

Since router public gateway port is related to the
external network, and this port can be used for some
service, like VPN. So after this patch we will only
allow the gateway port to update the IP address
directly, aka device_owner network:router_gateway.

The following l3 router ports will not be allowed to
directly update the IP address:
  network:ha_router_replicated_interface
  network:router_centralized_snat
  network:router_ha_interface
  network:router_interface
  network:router_interface_distributed

Default Ubuntu release which is used under devstack, has been changed
from Xenial to Bionic [1].
Fortunately, backward compatibility for Xenial was added.

Until we are not compatible with Bionic, we need to use older

At the moment, if a cluster fails to be created, we fall back to
getting the node information from Heat directly.  However, this
behaviour doesn't work at the moment because `self.cluster` is
a copy of the API record on-create which does not have the stack
ID yet.

This patch makes an extra HTTP request to get the `stack_id` in
order to get the server IPs and be able to pull down the correct
information.

Given the file to be configured, if user ""stack"" even doesn't have
read access, the result of configuration is not expected. iniset
with ""-sudo"" option will always create the section and the option
which we want to configure for each calling, no matter whether this
section and this option exist in the file or not. The root cause is
the calling of grep and ini_has_option in iniset don't use the ""sudo""
option.

The functional jobs are currently deploying with an empty list of
admission control list which means that the service token controller
does not go up resulting in the cluster failing to go up.

This patch drops that so it uses the default values of the admission
controllers in order to get the cluster to go up cleanly.

- Export tripleo_undercloud_conf_file hieradata, needed by Ansible when

Change Ib0ec1012b74e9a9e74c8879f3feed5f9332b711f introduced
a new VirtDriverNotReady exception which the ironic driver raises
when asked to retrieve a list of nodes and ironic-api is not
available, like if nova-compute is started before ironic-api.
This is normal and meant to be self-healing, but we can get it
in other periodic tasks besides update_available_resource which
leads to ugly exception traces on startup in the logs. This adds
handling for the exception in the _sync_power_states periodic
task.

Microversion 2.56 allows cold migrating to a specified target host. The
compute API sets the requested destination on the request spec with the
specified target host and then conductor sends that request spec to the
scheduler to validate the host. Conductor later persists the changes to
the request spec because it's the resize flow and the flavor could change
(even though in this case it won't since it's a cold migrate). After
confirming the resize, if the server is live migrated it will fail during
scheduling because of the persisted RequestSpec.requested_destination
from the cold migration, and you can't live migrate to the same host on
which the instance is currently running.

This change adds a test to recreate the regression bug.

If you use redis as a caching backend and you delete a server with
no consoleauth tokens you'll get a stacktrace as an empty list is
passed down to the redis client and ultimately the redis server
which responds with an error, complaining about a wrong number
of arguments for the del command.
The code now checks if the list of tokens is empty and only calls
the caching backend if there are tokens available to delete.
This also may improve performance, as it no longer hands down an
empty list.

In the related bug (below) we can see getting tags from a
QuotaImageTagsProxy can sometimes cause an infinite loop, presumably
because of bizarre threading circumstances. To at least provide a bit
more information when this bizarre circumstance happens, instead
of looping, resulting in a stackoverflow and the processing being
terminated without a traceback, now raise a TypeError. This should
help figure out what may be going on in the rare times this happens.

Also, it is generally a healthy idea to always have a guard like this
in a __getattr__ that uses an attr.

This removes the nova-osapi_compute service version

Newton.

A ""nova-status upgrade check"" was added for that
in Rocky:

  Ie2bc4616439352850cf29a9de7d33a06c8f7c2b8

And it is also causing issues with functional tests
where instances are buried in cell0 and because we
don't use the instance mapping, we fail to find the
instance.

As a result of this, compute API tests that rely on
retrieving a real instance out of the database will
also need to make sure an associated instance mapping
record exists.

I01f20f275bbd5451ace5c1e6f41ab38d488dae4e to document the
regression, introduced in Ocata, where allocation ratio settings
in the aggregate core/ram/disk filters are not honored because
of placement being used by the FilterScheduler.

While there is related work going on around this in
blueprint initial-allocation-ratios and
blueprint placement-aggregate-allocation-ratios, it is still
a limitation in the current code base and needs to be called
out in the docs.

in _create_client, so rather than do that, this change
just makes _create_client call clear_provider_cache

to avoid logging something useful on construction of the

With commit 5d1a50018510b2b281ad33895ae2d9555f5d5b05 each
API/AggregateAPI class instance constructs a SchedulerReportClient
which holds an in-memory lock during its initialization.

With at least 34 API extensions constructing at least
one of those two API classes, the accumulated affect of the
SchedulerReportClient construction can slow down nova-api startup
times, especially when running with multiple API workers, like
in our tempest-full CI job (there are 2 workers, so 68 inits).

This change simply defers constructing the SchedulerReportClient
until it is used, which is only in a few spots in the API code,
which should help with nova-api start times.

The AggregateAPI also has to construct the SchedulerQueryClient
separately because SchedulerClient creates both the query and
report clients.

Long-term we could consider making it a singleton in nova.compute.api
if that is safe (the aggregate code might be relying on some caching
aspects in the SchedulerReportClient).

We want projects to be using release-notes-jobs-python3, but most
still have release-notes-jobs configured in their stable
branches. Because tags are not branch aware, this means that we end up
running two versions of the release notes publishing job when we tag
releases. Those two jobs race, and at least one usually fails.

By removing the tag pipeline entry from the older project template we
avoid running two jobs for tag events, while continuing to use the
older job when patches merge into older branches.

When creating a server (the 'nova boot' command),
it calls 'POST /servers' API.

The response does not have 'addresses' and 'flavor' attributes.
When accessing 'networks' attribute in the '_print_server' function,
it calls 'GET /servers/{server_id}' and get the 'addresses' and
'flavor' attributes.

If 'GET /servers/{server_id}' fails, the server object does not have
the 'flavor' attribute, then KeyError is raised when accessing it.

Fix the issue by making it raise a CommandError
when the 'GET /servers/{server_id}' fails.

During the initial creation of the os-resource-classes repo it
was put under nova.config. This was probably not the right choice
but was done to be aligned with os-traits, which is a very
similar library.

Instead of keeping os-resource-classes in the past for the sake of
os-traits, let's move them both to the future, and include
osc-placement, the openstack client plugin for placement, as well.

The placement.config is a superset of the nova.config. If/when
placement is its own project team, os-resource-classes, os-traits,
and osc-placement will be members of the deliverables.

Before this patch, both the sync tool and the production code
would assume that 'network:dhcp' owner ports would be for
the OVN metadata service. However, since Neutron DHCP agents
can be deployed as well on OVN environments, we need to support
these ports as well.

This change is doing several things:

- Fixing sync tool so that Neutron DHCP ports are not deleted
  anymore (these ports are owned by DHCP and have a device_id
  as 'dhcp<host_uuid>-<network_id>'). Syncing these ports in
  OVN will no longer result in creating 'localport' ports but
  normal ports to allow non-local DHCP traffic.
- Fixing networking-ovn code to skip such ports when looking
  for the metadata port on a specific network.
- Newly created metadata ports will have a device_id such as
  'ovnmeta-<network_id>'.

- This change tries to address an edge case discovered
  when running placement under mod_wsgi where
  if the placement wsgi application is re-initialize the db_api
  configure method attempts to reconfigure a started transaction
  factory.

- This since oslo.db transaction factories do not support
  reconfiguration at runtime this result in an exception being
  raised preventing reloading of the Placement API without
  restarting apache to force mod_wsgi to recreate the
  python interpreter.

- This change introduces a run once decorator to allow annotating
  functions that should only be executed once for the lifetime fo
  an interpreter.

- This change applies the run_once decorator to the db_api configure
  method, to suppress the attempt to reconfigure the current
  TransactionFactory on application reload.

Previous fix

2f32c98a RemoteFS: don't fail in do_mount if already mounted

was made with the assumption that ""already mounted"" appearing
in stderr from an NFS mount means that the NFS share was already
mounted.

However, the NFS client can fail with ""busy or already mounted""
in cases where it fails to mount the share as well.

This results in the Cinder NFS backup driver believing that the
NFS mount has succeeded when it didn't, and as a result, data
can be written to the local disk instead of the NFS target.

Fail if the share isn't actually mounted rather than succeeding.

When ovs-vswitchd process is restarted neutron-ovs-agent will
handle it and reconfigure all ports and openflows in bridges.
Unfortunatelly when tunnel networks are used together with
L2pop mechanism driver, this driver will not notice that agent
lost all openflow config and will not send all fdb entries which
should be added on host.

In such case L2pop mechanism driver should behave in same way like
when neutron-ovs-agent is restarted and send all fdb_entries to
agent.

This patch adds ""simulate"" of agent start flag when ovs_restart is
handled thus neutron-server will send all fdb_entries to agent and
tunnels openflow rules can be reconfigured properly.

not being saved to or cleared from the ironic port.

When a VIF is attached to a portgroup with a MAC address, VIFPortIDMixin
updates the MAC address of the neutron port with the MAC address of the
portgroup.  The common mixin class VIFPortIDMixin is currently designed
to support non-neutron network interfaces. In order to do this, the
neutron port is first queried, and this query is allowed to fail. This
behaviour is both inefficient, requiring an unnecessary neutron API
call; and error prone, as failures are ignored when accessing the
neutron API.

This change removes the neutron port query during VIF attachment, and
assumes that the VIF being attached does in fact reference a valid
neutron port.

- The keys are not used when creating users in the mysql_user

- The private key must be converted to PKCS-1 in order to work

- The MySQL client configuration is missing the settings that

- Hard-coding the cipher causes problems for older clients,

Ensure that `galera-req.pem` is removed when

removed, the ""Create galera ssl request"" task does not run again, which
is required to create a new CSR and private key.

Copy the correct files to non-bootstrap Galera nodes, which are:
- CA certificate
- Private key for CSR
- Signed certificate

Rename a few variables for clarity between private key and certificate.

Previous fix

2f32c98a RemoteFS: don't fail in do_mount if already mounted

was made with the assumption that ""already mounted"" appearing
in stderr from an NFS mount means that the NFS share was already
mounted.

However, the NFS client can fail with ""busy or already mounted""
in cases where it fails to mount the share as well.

This results in the Cinder NFS backup driver believing that the
NFS mount has succeeded when it didn't, and as a result, data
can be written to the local disk instead of the NFS target.

Fail if the share isn't actually mounted rather than succeeding.

Until we fix our driver inheritance model, this job is almost guaranteed
to always pass. Rather than wasting gate resources for every patch, just
remove the job from the zuul pipelines for now.

It can still be run locally by calling `tox -e compliance`, so new
driver developers, and probably driver reviewers, should still run this
to make sure there is nothing missing, but that is unlikely if they
follow driver conventions.

In Stein release, Nova will deprecate their legacy (unversioned)
notifications that were used by Vitrage.
Vitrage should support both the versioned notifications and the legacy
notifications. In another change, we will switch the default behavior
to prefer the versioned notifications (in case both are sent by Nova).

As of change https://review.openstack.org/619260/ to oslo.policy
a lot of information is logged at debug for every policy check,
which gets to be a lot of information in something like the
nova-api logs which does a policy check per API request. So this
change makes the default log level INFO for oslo.policy.

In change 'I071182c00a0', the '_get_pinning' inner function of
'nova.virt.hardware._pack_instance_onto_cores' was extended to calculate
emulator thread pinning information along with guest vCPU pinning
information. Unfortunately, there is a code path used for calculating
vCPU pinning information in '_pack_instance_onto_cores' which does not
use this function and emulator thread pinning was therefore not being
calculated in some cases.

Replace this code path with a call to '_get_pinning', ensuring that all
permutations follow a similar flow and that the emulator thread pinning
information is calculated, as expected.

We also add a log which appears to have been missed in the
aforementioned change.

libvirt collects and exposes information about the host just as it does
for guests. This information includes things like the host CPU topology.
Nova uses this information to, among other things, generate an instance
of 'nova.objects.numa.NUMACell' for each host NUMA cell. The 'siblings'
field for each of these objects is populated using a combination of the
siblings information exposed by libvirt minus the cores we've been told
not to use, via the nova-specific 'vcpu_pin_set' option.

On pretty much any standard (x86) machine, it would be exceedingly
unlikely to find an asymmetric topology like so:

  socket 0
    core 0
      thread 0  (CPU #0)
      thread 1  (CPU #2)
    core 1
      thread 0  (CPU #1)

(note the missing 'CPU 3').

However these do happen in nova's world and are perfectly valid, thanks
to the aforementioned 'vcpu_pin_set' option. Historically, once we've
generated this list of sibling sets needed for the 'siblings' field,
we've filtered out sets that contain less than two siblings (i.e. the
cores have no siblings, or CPU #1 in the above example). This would be a
fair assumption on normal hardware, where asymmetric topologies like the
above wouldn't exist, but it doesn't really make sense in this use case.
What we're trying to expose via the siblings attribute is the
relationships between cores: if no relationship exists, we should say as
much.

The code that populates the 'siblings' attribute is modified to no
longer exclude sibling sets with only one sibling. This allows us to
simplify code that was previously having to switch between the
'siblings' attribute and the flat 'cpuset' attribute. In addition, all
tests that use the 'NUMACell' object are updated to set the 'sibling'
attribute as it is now always set in ""real"" code. This ensures behavior
hasn't regressed.

The current check uses an alignment of 512 bytes and will fail when the
underlying device has sectors of size 4096 bytes, as is common e.g. for
NVMe disks. So use an alignment of 4096 bytes, which is a multiple of
512 bytes and thus will cover both cases.

completely restructure get_console_output():
- make common code flow visible,

- simplify selection of console sources with one extensible struct
- common checks for each error type (console not found/file not found)
- extract pty-specific code

functional changes:
- none

side effects:
- Existence of pty-type consoles is now explicitly checked by the code and
  returns the same 'console logfile for instance does not exist' message
  as the  filebased console. Before, this case most likely triggered some
  obscure logmessage from readpty(). API-functionality is unchanged by
  this, both old and new code return an empty string.

When we instantiate the compute rpcapi, with upgrade_levels=auto,
we determine the minimum service version of nova-compute. If we
find no computes, we log a message. This may be known, if we are
starting at zero day and no computes have started, but may also
indicate a more serious problem. In either case, logging this once
per process (especially in the case of multi-worker, multi-module

The backup driver name is configured uniformly from the Stein version.
For example, support for
'cinder.backup.drivers.service.ServiceBackupDriver' does not support
'cinder.backup.drivers.service'.

However, the above two backup drivers are supported in a stable version
before Rocky (including Rocky).

For the same storage backend, if the backup driver used to create the
backup file is 'cinder.backup.drivers.service.ServiceBackupDriver',
the backup driver configured when restoring the backup is
'cinder.backup.drivers.service'. The recovery of the backup file will
fail because the drivers do not match.

Therefore, the processing of this method needs to be compatible with the
backup driver for different configurations of the same backend.

The above 'service' is a proxy, it can be one of {'swift', 'nfs',
'ceph', 'glusterfs', 'google', 'tsm', 'posix'}

It leads to the fact that during the configuration the jobs fails

There is no need to relable that folder since it's read-only.
After removing "":z"" it is possible to deploy the overcloud with

This patch includes the basic logic and utilities that are needed to make
the HA AA version of the kuryr controller work. This update features a new
thread safe version of the hash ring, which is crude at the moment. It also
enables handlers to check if they were assigned a job against the hash ring.

Changes:
    Cluster Membership checks: checks to see if other pods of kuryr controllers are still running
    Membership Ring: A wrapper class around the tooz hash ring that simplifies use and enables
		       thread safe resizing, and exponential timeout on reads.
    Node Identity: the namespace and name of each kuryr controller pod is now injected in
                    environment variables when the pod is created. This enables nodes to
                    identify themselves in the kubernetes api, and will be a part of
                    upcoming patches in the HA AA implementation.

octavia::health_manager::event_streamer_driver is forcely set to
'queue_event_streamer' with no option to change it. The event streamer
specifies which driver to use for syncing Octavia and Neutron LBaaS
databases. It is highly recommended to disable if one doesn't need to
sync the database or is running Octavia in standalone mode by setting
event_streamer_driver to noop_event_streamer.

Adds the access_log_format parameter that can be used to set
the log format that is used in the vhosts that puppetlabs-apache
manages.

Adds the same parameter to the init class to make sure that you
can set it when managing apache from there and not including the
wsgi::apache class manually.

The default value of the parameter is the same as enforced in other
modules that has the access_log_format, which is false. That is the
default that the puppetlabs-apache module has.

   value; wrong, the reported value is stale(not including the volume
   size lvm is creating), the value scheduler kept is currect.

This patch is to make cinder-volume reporting currect size.
