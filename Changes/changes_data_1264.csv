vlan isolation.

This requires changing the form of the existing ovs-vsctl command to set

This patch adds an initial version of the Dogtag plugin
that implements the decrypt(), encrypt() and generate()
functions.  In this version, we will create and initialize
an NSS database on the server to do crypto operations
within the Dogtag DRM python client.  This allows us to
decrypt() and encrypt() secrets without passing in wrapping
keys.

When the barbican-client and the Barbican server API have
been changed to pass through the wrapping keys, this plugin
will need to enhanced to make the relevant DRM client calls.

This plugin has been tested by running the barbican server
within a virtual environment.  There are several steps
needed to get things configured, which are detailed in the
blueprint.

Added unit tests.  These unit tests will be skipped if the
dogtag dependencies are not present to import.

There is a known issue in legacy grub. When using splashimage with
serial console, Legacy grub wont start properly. This commit is to
ensure that when serial console is used, legacy grub should not
contain splashimage. It also adds serial support to legacy grub
configuration file.

If one calls update_port and the lport is not stored in the nvp_lport_mapping

we should catch NotFound and return the port in error state. This patch fixes
this for havana and also corrects the fake_api_client to raise NotFound in this
case. This problem does not exist in IceHouse though as we query NSX with *

There was a bug in the code that checked to see if the
appropriate WWPN for a preferred node was available on the storage
host in intialize_connection.  It was assumed that there would only
ever be one preferred WWPN.  The code just checked to see if the list of
preferred WWPNs was in the list of available WWPNs.  This would only work
if all of the WWPNs were available on the storage host.  This resulted in
volumes not being able to be mounted when they should have been
available.

This fix changes the check of the preferred WWPNs to check each
item in the list until one is found.  The first one found is used
as the target WWPN.  If no match is found, the old default behavior
of selecting the first available WWPN is used.  I have added a
warning message for this case as it is quite possible that this
won't work in the user's environment as was the case that uncovered
this bug.

Note that this change is only relevant for systems that are not using
multipath as systems that use multipath don't choose one WWPN, they
just send the whole available list back.

Radware's load balancer currently supports three network interfaces.
Prior to this code addition, the configuration of those three
interfaces was: one interface for management, one for high
availability backup, and one for load balancing servers where the
IP that the outside world sees (VIP) and the IP that the servers
respond to (PIP) are identical.

This change adds a new ""2-legged"" configuration: one interface for
management, one interface for a VIP network, and one interface for the
PIP and the high availability backup network.

During VIP creation, the LBaaS driver detects if the incoming
configuration is ""2-legged"" by comparing VIP and PIP networks.  If they
are different it allocates a new port on the PIP network in order to
obtain an IP address for the PIP and names that port after its
associated VIP ID.  vDirect is then directed to create a load balancer
with the PIP network also used as the HA network instead of using the
vDirect container's default HA network configuration.

During VIP deletion, the LBaas driver detects if a port for the PIP
had been previously allocated by searching for and deleting port names
that map to the VIP ID.

This deprecates the instance_get_all_by_filters() method from
conductor, which is no longer used.

This also removes a test that was mocking the conductor method,
but that really tests nothing at all. Perhaps a new test to ensure
that the period=0 case is handled properly is in order, but this
test definitely wasn't doing that.

behavior, although useful, shouldn't be considered a sane default. A
good example is when using `limit` on listing operations. If the default
is to stream, the limit will be ignored because the server client will
get everything from the server until there's anything left to consume.
This behavior can also be harmful if not used carefully.

This patch adds a `stream` method to the iterator and makes using this
behavior an explicit operation. The user has to opt-in for data
streaming.

This patch adds support for 'ha_nodes' option
of Murano Repository service. This
options should contain a string with
all controller nodes and service ports.

For example:
ha_nodes = node-1:8084, node-2:8084, node-3:8084

Port 8084 will be listened by other controllers
and any changes made will be replicated to all
other controllers.

Firewall should be opend to allow this port
to be accessed by other controllers through
the management network.

The Repository service uses Keystone's auth
tokens for authentificetion on other
controller nodes.

nodes_to_node_port_list function generates
this string from the array of controller nodes.

uses dict access on instance, as the _run_instance() path is not
converted to Instance objects yet.

NOTE: This also removes a duplicate call to self._lookup_by_name()

self.instance_exists() and then self._lookup_by_name(), but instance_exists()
calls _lookup_by_name() itself.

The test_integration_1 test was waiting on volume being in an
'in-use' state before proceeding. However the 'in-use' state
doesn't actually mean that the volume is attached, as 'attaching'
gets mapped to 'in-use' in nova.

This makes it possible for the test to proceed when the volume is
in an attaching state, and not actually ever attached. Which means
you can get to the detach phase on an non attached volume, and
thus explode.

Use the attachment status to filter out when then volume is not
actually ready.

In the process, make the test name something that's actually
descriptive for what it does.

In OpenStack dashboard, error messages that pop up to end users
present several problems:
 * When they are based on exception message,
   they are often too technical and/or not helpful.
 * When they are set by horizon code, they cannot
   (without changing source code) be customized by cloud
   providers (that may want to adapt them to their business rules)

This patch is a first attempt to address this problem.
It's a work in progress and we hope it will be a good
start for discussions and early feedbacks.

How does it work:
 * It adds an adapter class called HTMLException:
   it's aimed to be the HTML part of an exception.
   HTMLException wrap python exceptions when it happen and provides a
   method called ""render"" that knows how to render
   the underlying exception object.

 * When an exception is being rendered, the render method will
   look up for a django templates (for that, it tries to map
   the exception class name to a template name),
   if no specific template for that class of exception in defined,
   it falls back to a default template.

 * Templates are created under a directory called ""exceptions"",
   ""base"" and ""default"" template can be provided by OpenStack dashboard,
   when specific exceptions templates may be defined by users
   throw another Django application. (we include specific template
   in this patch mainly for example).

 * To be flexible on how to render an exception,
   templates will get in their context:
     * The exception object being raised
     * The exception class
     * The exception traceback.
     * Error message set in horizon source code (if any).

When unshortened IPv6 address provided to allocation pool, DHCP

The root cause is that current code compares provided unshortened

Libvirt currently attempts to unplug VIFs after destroying an
instance, which can fail if the instance was never built
properly in the first place. This patch makes it ignore errors
when trying to tear down VIFs during that cleanup. Failure
in this case would block the deletion of the instance (which
should never happen) and any real failures aren't something

The path being sent to get_container_info didn't include the ver
so downstream path parsers were off by one on interpretting
parms.  get_info is mocked in unit tests so not caught there,
found while doing an example for the docs.  The version doesn't
matter in this case, just need a placeholder so the downstream
functions get the parms correct.

Also added policy support for custom endpoint names which was
missing before and tightened up unit test coverage for both
functional issues addressed here.

This patch removes all direct calls to dbapi's get_node(). They are
replaced either by Node.get(), Node.get_by_id(), or Node.get_by_uuid()
calls.

Additional detail about the changes:

1) Break DBAPI get_node() into get_node_by_id() and get_node_by_uuid().
   Let's be explicit about which type we're passing. This allows
   Node.get_by_uuid() to work exactly how its named. Also, do not
   return an object from the DB API calls. The Node object itself will
   do the conversion.
2) Adds Node.get_by_id() to compliment the current Node.get_by_uuid()
   for places you are querying by the ID.
3) Adds Node.get() so that you can still have a single method to use
   to pass either and ID or a UUID.
4) Make all of the Node.get* calls set the 'context' so that you can
   later just node.save() without passing it. Doc strings have been
   updated to clarify what 'context' is for.

NOTE:
   This patch is intended only for 4.1 branch
   due to changes in murano repositories structure.

   This patch is required to have murano-repository HA mode working.

This patch adds support for 'ha_nodes' option of Murano Repository service. This
options should contain a string with all controller nodes and service ports.

Config example:
   ha_nodes = node-1:8084, node-2:8084, node-3:8084

Port 8084 will be listened by other controllers and any changes made will be
replicated to all other controllers.

Firewall should be opened to allow this port to be accessed by other
controllers through the management network.

The Repository service uses Keystone's auth tokens for authentificetion on other
controller nodes.

'nodes_to_node_port_list' function generates this string
from the array of controller nodes.

Using ssh depends on the host being set up to be able to SSH into
itself which is not a common scenario.  While this is unavoidable for
the current implementation of resize across multiple hosts, if there
is a single host (i.e. a test scenario) or the resize is restricted
to the same host then we can succeed without SSH access

Dependency on Ia310e31d31aaf5c979e41c64af8223202a18e03a is because the
tests will always fail without Ia310 therefore this fix cannot be tested
without taking Ia310 as well.

As the author of Trollius, I'm asking to allow the new release because I want
to use it in pending patches.

Trollius 0.2 is compatible with 0.1.6. Trollius 0.2 has the (almost the) same
API than asyncio in Python 3.4 (will should be released next week end) and
Tulip 0.4.1. After the final release of Python 3.4, backward incompatible
changes are no more allowed, so there is no need to restrict Trollius version
to < 0.2.

Trollius 0.2 uses the syntax ""yield From(...)"" instead of ""yield ..."", but the
old syntax is still allowed.

Anyway, right now, no OpenStack component use Trollius. Pending patches:

* https://review.openstack.org/#/c/70948/ : patch written for Trollus 0.1, but
  it works on Trollius 0.2 too. I will update the patch to require Trollius 0.2
  and use ""yield From(...)""
* https://review.openstack.org/#/c/77925/ : tests are failing because this
  patch requires Trollius 0.2, that's why I would like to upgrade Trollius

I also moved trollius to the right section of dependencies. Sorry, I didn't
noticed first that dependencies were grouped.

Trollius has now a much better documentation:
http://trollius.readthedocs.org/

This patch adds opportunity of migrations testing.
By this test each migration checks on mysql/postgres dialects in
upgrade > downgrade> upgrade mode.
Also models are tested to equality with actual database state.
In this patch an opportunity of testing migrations adds.
We just need to add _pre_upgrade_NUM, _check_NUM, _post_downgrade_NUM
methods with number of migration (NUM).
It works for both of repos (migrate and alembic).

Models will be tested on different things:
- columns (type, length, nullable),
- constraints (indexes, unique keys, foreign keys),
- list of tables.

This patch contains a check methods for 15 migration as a sample.

There is a testing of migrations in oslo.
We can check equality of models with migrations in different
backends. Also we can check an each migration in full mode
(upgrade > downgrade > upgrade).
Migrate and alembic repos can be tested together.
We have only sqlite testing of migrations in upgrade mode now.
But there are a lot of bugs that can be visible in other
dialects. Also a lot of migrations that can have mistakes in downgrade.
So we should have both of these tests in ceilometer for successfull
checking of migrations.

but don't continue requerying for every line in the tempest.conf when

Tokens were always hashed with MD5. This change allows tokens to
be hashed with SHA256 (or any other algorithm supported by the
keystoneclient token hash function). This is for security
hardening.

There's a new configuration option 'hash_algorithm' in the [token]
section. This is the algorithm to use for hashing PKI tokens, so is
used

a) when storing the token in the db
b) as the hash in the revocation list

hash_algorithm defaults to 'md5' for backwards compatibility.

I've seen several folks recently have problems with their Swift
clusters because they had different hash prefixes on different

Note that MD5-equality is stronger than what we need (which is
ConfigParser-equality for a particular set of keys), but this way we
don't expose the secret hash prefix and suffix across the internal
network, just the MD5 checksum of the file containing them.

Note that there are some negative tests which call the pause API but on
invalid server states, i.e. non-existent server, unpausing a server
that's not paused, etc, but those shouldn't get down to the virt driver
so we don't need to skip them since they should fail in the Nova API
service, not in the compute service.

Our translation policy
(https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/LoggingStandards#Log_Translation) calls
for not translating debug level logs. This is to help prioritize log
translation. Furthermore translation has a performance overhead, even if
the log isn't used (since nova doesn't support lazy translation yet).

Remove unnecessary debug level log translation in the scheduler to
comply with our translation policy. This has the added benefit of making
the scheduler slightly faster too.

Add a local hacking rule to enforce this.

assigned network roles. This leads to bad consequences, such as an exceptions

Since now, if a NIC has assigned network roles, it won't be removed from
the database, even if a new metadata has been received without that NIC.

When executing a pagination query a ""next"" link is included in the
API reply when there are more items then the specified limit.

See pagination documentation for more information:
http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-compute/2/content/
Paginated_Collections-d1e664.html

The caller should be able to invoke the ""next"" link (without
having to re-format it) in order to get the next page of data.
The documentation states ""Subsequent links will honor the
initial page size. Thus, a client may follow links to traverse
a paginated collection without having to input the marker parameter.""

The problem is that the ""next"" link is always scoped to the
non-detailed query.

For example, if you execute ""/v2/<tenant>/servers/detail?limit=1"",
the ""next"" link does not have the URL for a detailed query and is
formatted as ""/v2/<tenant>/servers?limit=1&marker=<marker>"". In this
case the ""next"" link needs to be scoped to ""/v2/<tenant>/servers/detail"".
Common code is used for both the v2 and v3 APIs.

Existing test cases will be updated to verify that the next link is
correctly scoped for both the v2 and v3 APIs.

The user could work around this issue my manually inserting '/details'
into the ""next"" link URL.
