of 6 (instances in the gate are 6 VCPU's), and things
seem to be stable at this value.

For folks running on 'smaller' system, it's still possible
to run in parallell > ncpu's but if there are problems you
can still specify concurrency in your tox argument.  Tox will
take the last occurence of the conncurrency argument; so for
example if you specify ""tox -epy27 -- --concurrency=4"" the
interpretted value for concurrency in the run will be 4.

Changes to instance.system_metadata weren't properly being saved
to the DB. The change to 'network_allocated' would be written to
the DB but not updated on the instance object. When the network
was cleaned up before a reschedule, the object would not notice
network_allocated' getting set to False, and not write the change
to the DB. After the reschedule, the instance would still have
'network_allocated' set to True, and skip allocating a network.
The node would go active with no network.

Since this is happening in the _allocate_network_async greenthread,
the solution is not to save in the async thread. The main thread
and the async thread share a reference to the same object and the
main thread waits for the async thread to finish before the final
save, so saving is unnecessary. I added comments on the
instance.save() calls that were part of the race so they don't get
removed or changed and reintroduce this bug.

Also, update the relevant test from mox to mock.

Removed use of contextlib.nested call from codebase, as it has been
deprecated since Python 2.7.

There are also known issues with contextlib.nested that were addressed
by the native support for multiple ""with"" variables. For instance, if
the first object is created but the second one throws an exception,
the first object's __exit__ is never called. For more information see
https://docs.python.org/2/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.nested
contextlib.nested is also not compatible with Python 3.

Multi-patch set for easier chunks. This one addresses the tests from
neutron/tests/unit/api directory.

Line continuation markers (e.g. '\') had to be used or syntax
errors were thrown. While using parentheses is the preferred way
for multiple line statements, but in case of long with statements
backslashes are acceptable.

The get_routers method in the l3 RPC code has a log.debug

JSON. This method can be expensive if there are hundreds
of routers being synced and it happens even if debugging
is disabled since the function call result is the parameter

callable and its args and defers calling it until the __str__ method
is called on it when it's actually trying to be rendered to a string.

    Sends a blank line sufficient to flush buffers.

    This is to ensure Eventlet versions that don't support
    eventlet.minimum_write_chunk_size will send any previous data

    If https://bitbucket.org/eventlet/eventlet/pull-request/37

The ssync Receiver performs some checks on request parameters
in initialize_request() before starting the exchange of missing
hashes and updates e.g. the destination device must be available;
the policy must be valid. Currently if any of these checks fails
then the receiver just closes the connection, so the Sender gets
no useful response code and noise is generated in logs by httplib
and wsgi Exceptions.

This change moves the request parameter checks to the Receiver
constructor so that the HTTPExceptions raised are actually sent
as responses. (The 'connection close' exception handling still
applies once the 'missing_check' and 'updates' handshakes are in
progress.)

Moving initialize_request() revealed the following lurking bug:
 * initialize_request() sets
       req.environ['eventlet.minimum_write_chunk_size'] = 0
 * this was previously ineffective because the Response environ
   had already been copied from Request environ before this value
   was set, so the Response never used the value :/
 * Now that it is effective (a good thing) it causes the empty string
   yielded by the receiver when there are no missing hashes in
   missing_checks() to be sent to the sender immediately. This makes
   the Sender.readline() think there has been an early disconnect
   and raise an Exception (a bad thing), as revealed by
   test/unit/obj/test_ssync_sender.py:TestSsync.test_nothing_to_sync

The fix for this is to simply make the receiver skip sending the empty
string if there are no missing object_hashes.

This reserved aggregate filter only allows certain tenants to use hosts in
an aggregate that has been marked for their use. If a request has the
scheduler hint 'reserved_pool' the host will be selected if it is marked
with the tenant's id. If the hint is not present the host will not be

Nova-compute never recovers from this state unless manually

py34 job was intended for unit tests only. It's important to distinguish
between different types of tests, because they all have different
requirements to execution environment. E.g. functional tests are not
expected to run in a restricted env designed for unit tests, and that's
even more valid for fullstack tests.

Otherwise, the job may fail or apply irrecoverable changes to test
runner system, breaking the system.

If we ever want to support py3 for other types of tests, we should add
separate jobs just for that.

Note that the neutron-python3 blueprint was not intended to introduce
changes to support anything but unit test execution with the new Python
version, so strictly speaking, any effort to make other test types work
is out of scope.

Since we're dropping Python 2.6 support, we can rely on stdlib's json
and get rid of our dependency on simplejson.

This lets us get rid of some redundant Unicode encoding. Before, we
would take the container-listing response off the wire,
JSON-deserialize it (str -> unicode), then pass each of several fields
from each entry to get_valid_utf8_str(), which would encode it,
(unicode -> str), decode it (str -> unicode), and then encode it again
(unicode -> str) for good measure.

The net effect was that each object's name would, in the proxy server,
go str -> unicode -> str -> unicode -> str.

By replacing simplejson with stdlib json, we get a guarantee that each
container-listing entry's name, hash, content_type, and last_modified
are unicodes, so we can stop worrying about them being valid UTF-8 or
not. This takes an encode and decode out of the path, so we just have
str -> unicode -> str. While it'd be ideal to avoid this, the first
transform (str -> unicode) happens when we decode the
container-listing response body (json.loads()), so there's no way out.

sys v init scripts are inherently racy since creating a PID file takes
a while. In particular collectived needs about 0.6 seconds to daemonize
itself and create its PID file. If the service gets restarted in this
interval the second instance of the daemon gets started without stopping
the previous one. Apparently mcollectived gets restarted very often during
the final phase of IBP. Hence get rid of sys V init script and use
upstart job to manage mcollectived.

This reverts commit ed799e38fe740621776aab51c95ec1db248af997.

Due to an introduced a regression[1]:
In case where neutron was configured to have more than one DHCP agent per
network (dhcp_agents_per_network<=2), dnsmasq rejects leases of others
dnsmasq instances. Some clients do not check server-id for those NAKs,
failing to set an address.

The reverted commit originally came to fix the issue[2] with DHCPNAKs sent
after neutron-dhcp-agent restart. This issue is expected to be fixed by a
separate patch[3].

As agreed on the summit I'm renaming the python modules
and doing some adjustments:
* This is a breaking change, so version is bumped to 2.0.0
* Used this chance to split conf options over proper sections
* RELEASES.rst is gone; it's too hard to keep it up-to-date;
  anyway git does better job at doing history
* Dropped deprecated option ports_for_inactive_interfaces
* Dropped old /v1/discover endpoint and associated client call
* No longer set on_discovery and newly_discovered in Node.extra
  (deprecated since 1.0.0, superseded by the get status API)
* Default firewall chain name is ""ironic-inspector"" and
  is configurable

Notes:
* Some links will be updated after real move.
* Stable branches will probably use the old name.
* Some usage of discovery word is left in context of
  ""discovered data""
* DIB element will probably be deprecated, so leaving it
  alone for now.
* Some usages of word ""discovery"" in the README will be updated
  later to make this patch a bit smaller
* Ramdisk code will be moved to IPA, so not touching it too much

This reverts commit 74a16fde1c9972dc3c5d07215ca9d5e8f2e23d70.
Due to an introduced a regression[1]:
In case where neutron was configured to have more than one DHCP agent per
network (dhcp_agents_per_network<=2), dnsmasq rejects leases of others
dnsmasq instances. Some clients do not check server-id for those NAKs,
failing to set an address.
The reverted commit originally came to fix the issue[2] with DHCPNAKs sent
after neutron-dhcp-agent restart. This issue is expected to be fixed by a
separate patch[3].

The current cookbook allows the enabled_apis nova.conf key
to include the metadata value.  This causes the nove compute
service to try to auto start the api-metadata service.  But we
also have the api-metadata recipe in the run list by default which
also tries to start the api-metadata service. This can cause timing
issues with the starting service.

This patch will remove the metadata value from the enabled_apis
attribute, and put out a warning if it's included.  The api-metadata
receipe should be used to control this service.  By default the
api-metadata recipe is included in the os-compute-api role which
is included in the os-compute-single-controller role. So, in most cases
it's already included in the run list.

Containers share many features in common with Nova instances. For the common
features, virt drivers for Nova can be used to surface basic instance
functionality. For features that go beyond what can be naturally fit within
a virt driver, we propose a new API service that allows for advanced features
to be added without conflating the worlds of instances and containers.

When trusted filter (nova/nova/scheduler/filters/trusted_filter.py)

method _do_request() in AttestationService class has this line:

action_url = ""https://%s:%d%s/%s"" % (self.host,
self.port, self.api_url, action_url)

It is easy to see that default type of attestation_port is string.
But in action_url self.port is required as integer (%d).
It leads to conflict.

This change provides more tests than is required only to cover this bug
fix. This cases are testing AttestationService _do_request() method
using different status_codes and different texts returned by mocked
request method.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

The .seconds attribute of a timedetla object cannot be taken in
isolation because it can overflow into days. For example, a -1 second
difference will become -1 day and 86399 seconds.

This became a problem when the agent clock was slightly ahead of
the server clock. When calling (server_time - agent_time).seconds
in this scenario, it would go below 0 in the daily seconds and
wraparound to 86399 seconds and -1 day.

This patch corrects the issue by using a method in timeutils that
ends up calling total_seconds(), which was designed for this usecase.
It also restores the formatting that was removed in patch:

Previously, we had urllib3 (via requests) automatically decode all
responses with a Content-Encoding of deflate or gzip. This included
object downloads, which would in turn cause etag or content-length
mismatch errors. (See bug 1338464)

This was apparently added in response to a third-party proxy sitting
between the client and server which, having observed that the client
would accept gzip-encoded content while the server sent an unencoded
response, would perform the compression. (See bug 1282861)

Now, we'll no longer let requests send any default headers, nor do any
decoding.

The retype command will always attempt a call
to the driver.retype method.  In *most* cases this
will hit the default impl which returns False because
most drivers don't implement any retype (most, a few do).

The problem is that the drivers that do implement this in
most cases will iterate through the settings and just make
the changes that are valid and ignore the rest, and then
return True. I think this is ""ok"" for the drivers to do,
drivers should be allowed to be somewhat dumb WRT Cinder
state management and placement info.  If we give them an
invalid command (which we're doing here) then it's on us
higher up the chain IMO.

The result is that for example if you're trying to retype
from backend-a to backend-b and backend-a implements retype
it can return True telling the manager that the volume was
succesfully retyped, even when it wasn't.

There's a lot of confusion around this bug, YES the
filter scheduler is used to determine if the retype is
valid and to what host.  That's not the issue, the issue
is that regardless of the source and destination host settings
that are provided from the filter-scheduler, we always make the
call to the driver, introducing the opportunity for a false
success status being reported back.

This patch adds a very simple check between the source and
destination host settings as provided by the scheduler and in
the case that the two are ""different""(not including pool designations)
we skip calling the driver.retype method altogether and fall through
to the migrate process.

This introduces a new hosts_are_equivalent method in
cinder.volume.utils

This patch just stops the resync attempt on the agent side if a failure
is caused by an IP address generation problem. Future updates to the subnet
will cause another attempt so if the tenant does fix the issue they will
get DHCP service.

Looking at the project names [1] it's clear that the official names don't end
in 'ing' (the only exception being Networking). The SDK follows the official
names as our module naming convention.

Hence we should not append 'ing' to module names whether they have an official
name in that list or not. We need to rename the messaging module to message.

nova service-update is handled by HostAPI.service_update method.
Normally, it searches for relevant Service object in DB and calls
update with parameters-to-update on it. However, in API cell it is
over-ridden so that service_update message can be routed to appropriate
cell. Once the destination cell is reached, the message processor
invokes HostAPI.service_update to perform the actual update. This
works in case of child cells.
However in case of API cells, since HostAPI.service_update has been
over-ridden, when the message processor invokes HostAPI.service_update
to perform actual update of the service, the API cell tries to again
route the message and fails in doing so with an AttributeError (as the
message is already at the destination cell and can not be further
routed).
This patch moves the object update() and save() call to a separate
method and modifies the message processor to call the new method. The
original service_update is also modified to call the new method.

Previously, the logic to calculate the LUN ID only considered a single attached
host. Because multiple hosts can be attached to a LUN, the logic needs to
consider multiple hosts. This patchset proposes to choose non-conflicting
LUN IDs across the whole array. This patch first checks for an empty LUN ID
across the array. If it doesn't find one, then it looks for the least used
LUN ID across the whole array.
The value of MAX_LUNS_PER_HOST has been changed here as the range function
iterates from 0 to n-1 LUN IDs. With Eseries backend, a maximum of 256 LUN_IDS
are supported, thus a value of 256 MAX_LUNS_PER_HOST is required.

some rough edges. Specifically around deadlines and the conversion to

a stake in the ground for when we transition fully to this new model,

Given that we will need to work with people during the transition,
what is proposed is a way to let us do that while not blocking existing

failures.

Running tox -e startenv will generate the environment file, run
""tools/kolla start"", and run first time initialization (eventually).

Running tox -e functional is for actually testing the deployed OpenStack
environment via a series of tests utilizing the client APIs.

Some of the tests remove _RELATIVE flag from fakelibvirt
module, to simulate old libvirt, which can cause other tests
to fail when they try to remove the same flag. This fail can
occur intermittently based on the order in which the tests
are invoked.

fakelibvirt already has the _RELATIVE flags defined in the
module. The tests should not update/add them and should only
remove them to simulate the absence of flag (re-adding them
at the end of testcase). This way irrespective of the order
in which the tests are run, it won't cause test to fail when
they try to remove _RELATIVE flag.

Using the flavor extra_specs property ""hw_watchdog_action"" was broken.
Scheduling of a new instance always failed with NoValidHostFound error
because of ComputeCapabilitiesFilter, which treated this property as a
host capability to be checked.

Commit f0ff4d51057080e769407e873e5ed212f15b773d caused the problem.

To fix this watchdog_action property is put into 'hw:' scope, so
that it will be ignored by ComputeCapabilitiesFilter in scheduler and
handled in libvirt driver. The doc must be fixed accordingly.

Now driver accepts both 'hw_watchdog_action' and
'hw:watchdog_action', tests were edited for these cases.
Were added TODO items to delete the compat code in L release.

To support the changes outlined in Iea53a45bb533968a13a85c0e7fbb0787325e4095
update the ACLs for all current infra projects.  The general approach is to
create a -core and -release group for every infra project, and then, if they
share commonalities, deal with that by using group inclusion in Gerrit.  This
reduces friction when adding core members to new projects.

The intent of this change is normalize all of the relevant configs so that
the -core group is used for reviews and the -release group for tags.  No
current infra projects have stable branches, so ACLs for proposed/ branches
were removed.  Similarly branch creation permissions were removed.  The
contributor agreement flag should not be changed.

Work will need to be done in Gerrit to set up these new groups before
this change merges for a seamless transition.

This fixes the test_security_group_member/rule_updated unit tests[1]
that breaks with a randomized PYTHONHASHSEED (see the bug report).

The test assumed that several dictionaries had elements in a

The fix refactors the test case by injecting values using the same

2. Cirros image name (currently: cirros-0.3.0-x86_64-disk) changed due
to a version update, therefore the grep command fails, leaving the
boot_args with missing value for --image.
3. Instances IPs extraction was fixed: now works regardless of the IP addresses

Other improvements:

CooperativeReader, being an eventlet-friendly wrapper around the
generator- based reader of image data, actually transforms
chunk-by-chunk iteration into the readable stream. It is used when the
image is being copied from the remote source: some generator-based
image data representing the remote source acts as its underlying
object, and the instance of CooperativeReader is passed as a data
stream to the backend client which uses it to read the data.

Before this patch, the CooperativeReader was ignoring the ""length""
parameter of the read method, always returning the whole chunk returned
by the underlying generator (in case of HTTP source the size of this
chunk is 16 M). This was causing problems for the clients attempting to
read data from it, and - under some circumstances - the loss of data.

For chunked storage of files in Swift a special class (ChunkReader,
declared in the swift store driver) is used to reduce the requested
read length so no extra data is read and transferred. However, this was
not working as the CooperativeReader (which was the underlying stream
for the ChunkReader) was ignoring the requested size. This was causing
the data to be lost when reading behind the boundaries of the Chunks.

This patchset introduces a buffer in the CooperativeReader to store the
most recently fetched iterator chunk. The reads are independent from
requests to iterator, so the CooperativeReader is able to return the
exact requested amount of bytes and no data is lost due to extra-reads.

Conflict Resolution Notes:
cherry-pick needed to have the old body of the complete: function
manually removed - it wasn't sure if it still belonged (resulting in
nearly duplicate code) or should be removed. I'm a bit surprised the
cherry-pick didn't auto-resolve.

Currently in libvirt operations which power off an instance such as stop,
shelve, rescue, and resize simply destroy the underlying VM. Some
GuestOS's do not react well to this type of power failure, and so it would
be better if these operations followed the same approach as soft_reboot
and give the guest as chance to shutdown gracefully.

The shutdown behavior is defined by two values:

- shutdown_timeout defines the overall period a Guest is allowed to
complete it's shutdown.  The default valus is set via nova.conf and can be
overridden on a per image basis by image metadata allowing different types
of guest OS to specify how long they need to shutdown cleanly.

- shutdown_retry_interval defines how frequently within that period
the Guest will be signaled to shutdown.  This is a protection against
guests that may not be ready to process the shutdown signal when it
is first issued. (e.g. still booting).  This is defined as a constant.

This is one of a set of changes that will eventually expose the choice
of whether to give the GuestOS a chance to shutdown via the API.

This change implements the libvirt changes to power_off() and adds
a clean shutdown to compute.manager.stop().

Subsequent patches will:
- Add clean shutdown to Shelve
- Add clean shutdown to Rescue
- Convert soft_reboot to use the same approach
- Expose clean shutdown via rpcapi
- Expose clean shutdown via API

nova service-update is handled by HostAPI.service_update method.
Normally, it searches for relevant Service object in DB and calls
update with parameters-to-update on it. However, in API cell it is
over-ridden so that service_update message can be routed to appropriate
cell. Once the destination cell is reached, the message processor
invokes HostAPI.service_update to perform the actual update. This
works in case of child cells.
However in case of API cells, since HostAPI.service_update has been
over-ridden, when the message processor invokes HostAPI.service_update
to perform actual update of the service, the API cell tries to again
route the message and fails in doing so with an AttributeError (as the
message is already at the destination cell and can not be further
routed).
This patch moves the object update() and save() call to a separate
method and modifies the message processor to call the new method. The
original service_update is also modified to call the new method.

Commit bd8329b34098436d18441a8129f3f20af53c2b91 added code to delay
sending a STOPPED lifecycle event for Xen domains to try and ease a race
during reboot where the STOPPED event is sent after the instance is
running again after the reboot operation completed and the
instance.task_state is None. This would trigger handling in the compute
manager which would assume the instance shouldn't be running and shuts
it down.  Since the instance is being shutdown, it's task_state is
'powering-off' when the lifecycle STARTED event comes in shortly after
the STOPPED event and it's ignored in _sync_instance_power_state.

The change here is to remove the Xen restriction because there is a
recreate (on Icehouse and Juno) with virt_type=KVM, so we can assume
this is racy for any configuration of libvirt and the reboot operation
and should add the delay for all virt types. The detailed logs with the
recreate are attached in the bug report.

When using libvirt, a reboot from inside of a kvm VM doesn't trigger
any libvirt lifecycle event. That's fine. But rebooting a Xen VM leads
to the events VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_STOPPED and VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_STARTED.
Nova compute manager catches these events and tries to sync the power
state of the VM with the power state in the database. In the case the VM
state is ACTIVE but the power state is something that doesn't fit, the
stop API call is executed to trigger all stop hooks. This leads to the
problem that a reboot of a Xen VM without using the API isn't possible.
To fix it, delay the emission of the STOPPED lifecycle event a couple of
seconds. If a VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_STARTED event is received while the STOPPED
event is pending, cancel the pending STOPPED lifecycle event so the VM
can continue to run.

As Neutron has grown, the need to continually evolve the way we land
code has changed. As the project has grown, it's become obvious we
need to subdivide responsibilites and merge rights across the
repository. The advanced services split [1] was one way in which we did
this, and it's proven effective. Plugin decomposition was another [2].
As a next step to evolve things, this changes the core reviewer
paradigm into a system of Lieutenants, all reporting to the PTL in the
project. The Lieutenants will be able to maintain their own core
review team. The idea of ""super cores"" will fade away. And we begin to
see the benefits of a layered, structured approach to managing
Neutron.

This proposal makes an attempt to comment on existing core reviewers.
While the idea of existing core reviewers being labeled as ""supercores""
has been floated, the reality is a bit more nuanced than that, and I've
taken steps to address that with this patch. It should be noted that like
all things in Neutron governance, the system is based on a mutual trust.

Update the calls to pkg_resources to avoid forcing a requirements check
when the plugins are being loaded.

There are 2 versions of the entry point API in different releases of
setuptools. In one version, the require keyword argument can be passed
to load(). In the other, separate methods resolve() and require() need
to be used. This change updates the mock and fake objects to support
either, since the fakes are subclasses of the EntryPoint class in
pkg_resources.

It would be better to replace the calls to pkg_resources with stevedore,
which provides a more stable API, abstracts away this difference, and
provides an API for creating test managers directly. That change would
have required more extensive updates to the test suite, though, and
since I'm not as familiar with this code base as others will be, I will
leave those changes for someone else.

is an obvious scenario to use single Network Bridge against the default

This change set supports not mandating the bridge_mappings to be
specified if the host has a single Network Bridge.  It will log a
warning message as this is not ideal on agent boot up.

This change set also moves exceptions into a common class.  This is an
ancillary change that was done to make unit testing the function easier.

Creates a devstack job template for Identity v3
API only; meaning v2 API is disabled.

The var DEVSTACK_LOCAL_CONFIG is set to
ENABLE_IDENTITY_V2=False, which will be inject
into Devstack local.conf and then honored.

Devstack will:
* Disable the v2 API in Keystone paste config;
* Set Tempest to skip Identity v2 tests and use
  v3 auth tokens to run all the other tests;
* Set Horizon to use v3 API and v3 auth tokens;
* Register the Identity endpoint as v3.

This job is initially being added only as
experimental to openstack-dev/devstack and
openstack/tempest, since there is work to be
done in order to i) get DevStack itself using v3
Identity API with v3 auth tokens when setting
up resources; and ii) Tempest use only v3
endpoint to get tokens to be used in tests.

Once devstack works with Identity v3 only, this
experimental job will be added to other projects,
in order to get fixes on them to make Tesmpest
tests pass.

Currently migrate_volume() in lvm.py does not pass volume size in
MiB but passes volume size in GiB to copy_volume(). The size argument
of copy_volume() requires MiB value. As a result, if the volume size
is 1GiB, copy_volume() copies only 1MiB head of 1GiB volume to the
destination volume, and then the volume data is corrupted.
This patch fixes to pass volume size in MiB.

Current post as copy routine (i.e. POST object with post_as_copy option
turned on) on Object Controller uses ""multipart-manifest"" query string
which is feeded to env['copy_hook'] to decide which data (the manifest or
object pointed by the manifest) should be copied.

However, the way using the query string will confuse operators looking at
logging system (or analyzing the log) because whole POST object requests
have 'multipart-manifest=get' like as:

POST /v1/AUTH_test/d4c816b24d38489082f5118599a67920/manifest-abcde%3Fmultipart-manifest%3Dget

We cannot know whether the query string was added by hand
(from user) or not. In addition, the query isn't needed by the
backend conversation between proxy-server and object-server.
(Just needed by ""copy_hook"" on the proxy controller!)

To remove the confusable query string and to keep the log to be clean,
this patch introduces new environment variable ""swift.post_as_copy""
and changes proxy controller and the copy_hook to use the new env.

This fixes the iptables_firewall group unit tests[1] that breaks with
a randomized PYTHONHASHSEED (see the bug report).

The test assumed that the _get_remote_sg_ids and

neutron.agent.linux.iptables_firewall returned elements in a particular
order. Found with PYTHONHASHSEED=1.

The fix refactors the test case to handle unsorted responses from

Sync change [1] that had been reverted at the time of the previous
sync [2] due to bug 1438321.

Change log:
f5646ed Revert ""Revert ""Optimization of waiting subprocesses in ProcessLauncher""""

Also, as monkey patching is done in parent process, os.waitpid(0, 0)
in _wait_child method also gets monkey-patched and eventlet goes crazy.
Connecting to parent process with strace shows that os.waitpid(0, os.WNOHANG)
is called, yet it is difficult to say what is really happening because
the process does not react on termination signals (SIGTERM, SIGHUP, SIGINT).

The solution is not to monkey patch os.waitpid, that is why in this change
the original os.waitpid is preserved.

Presently, the wsgi server allows persist connections hence even after
the response is sent to the client, it doesn't close the client socket
connection.
Because of this problem, the green thread is not released back to the pool.

In order to close the client socket connection explicitly after the
response is sent and read successfully by the client, you simply have to
set keepalive to False when you create a wsgi server.

Add a parameter to take advantage of the new(ish) eventlet socket timeout
behaviour. Allows closing idle client connections after a period of
time, eg:

$ time nc localhost 8776
real    1m0.063s

Setting 'client_socket_timeout = 0' means do not timeout.

DocImpact:
Added wsgi_keep_alive option (default=True).
Added client_socket_timeout option (default=900).

This removes time formatting that may be hiding timezone
issues that are leading to a delta being calculated between
the agent and the server even when it shows none. It also
adds logging of the difference so we can see how far off it
thinks they are.

Example message:
during the registration of Open vSwitch agent has a timestamp:
2015-05-19T18:15:27Z. This differs from the current server
timestamp: 2015-05-19T18:15:27Z by more than the threshold agent
downtime: 75.

Note that the timestamps are exactly the same after formatting.

PowerVM systems use a technology called Resource Monitoring and Control
(RMC).  This allows the hypervisor to perform dynamic operations to the
virtual machine (resize, migration, etc...).

This technology requires an Ethernet connection between the VM and the
PowerVM API.  This change set enables this via two means.

 - Refactoring the existing 'mgmt' nic connection into tasks.  This
   enables further tasks to determine if a mgmt VIF was created.
 - Send an additional network info element into the config drive to
   bring up the VIF on IPv6 link local.

PEP-0274 introduced dict comprehensions to replace dict constructor
with a sqeuence of key-pairs[1], these are benefits:
  First, it makes the code look neater.
  Second, it gains a micro-optimization.

Cinder dropped python 2.6 support in Kilo, we can leverage this now.
Note: This commit doesn't handle dict constructor with kwargs.

In order to handle the deprecated notifier_strategy configuration option
we just need to translate the notifier_strategy value as follows:

  default -> transport_url=None, driver='noop'
  noop -> transport_url=None, driver='noop'
  logging -> transport_url=None, driver='log'
  rabbit -> transport_url=rabbit:///, driver='messaging'
  qpid -> transport_url=qpid:///, driver='messaging'
  None -> transport_url=None, driver=None

where the last bit simply means that the user hasn't specified any
notifier_strategy and we should just have oslo.messaging load a notifier
based on oslo.messaging's config options.

It really doesn't need to be any more complicated than that, and we
certainly shouldn't need to poke at what the user may have configured
for transport_url in their config file.

The reason this is important is that CONF.transport_url is a private
configuration option which soon will not be visible to users of the
oslo.messaging API. See I9c3bf74f13a820ce295aa77a2bbcd781778b5926.

Also, simplify the testing of this stuff by mocking the oslo.messaging
APIs used and using the test scenarios outlined above. This also means
we stop poking around in oslo.messaging internals like:

       self.assertEqual(str(nfier._transport._driver._url),
                        'qpid:///')

Naughty, naughty!

Note: it's arguable we should just remove notifier_strategy in Juno
since we deprecated it in Icehouse, but this patch will be useful to
backport to stable/icehouse in any case.

BACKPORT NOTE (markmc): The idea with backporting it is that you might
want to run Icehouse glance with Juno oslo.messaging ... say during an
upgrade ... and Juno oslo.messaging will likely enforce this as a
private implementation detail, thereby breaking Icehouse glance.

This commit adds a new alarm for metric rabbitmq_max_channels_per_conn,
which is a metric representing the largest (max) number of channels per
connection across all rabbitmq connections. We have chosen a threshold
of 10 -- running a dev cluster periodically sees
rabbitmq_max_channels_per_conn > 1 and 10 is an 'arbitrary but likely
reasonable limit' which we can use to prevent channel ballooning.

modules.

This also adds logging to the gate run and cleans up the console

W/o this patch, the rabbitmq app may remain joined cluster
but not started and keep running without being noticed by
OCF logic. But by design, the app is supposed to be stopped for
some cases and, in general, the monitor action should not
treat this state as en error.

This is a problem as we don't want the rabbit app retained
stopped because in this state the rabbit node cannot process
AMQP at all.

The solution is to make the rabbit app at least have tried
to start (a lazy start attempt) in the end of monitor
and ignore results because it is normal when the app cannot start
for some transient cluster states.

Convert the result of keys(), values() and items() dict method to list
when a list is expected. On Python 3, these methods now return an
iterator, not a list.

Instead of getting the key with .keys()[0] and then the value with
.values()[0], get both at the same time using .items()[0]. It ensures
that the key is consistent with the value, but it is also more
efficient.

Enable ceilometer.tests.storage.test_impl_sqlalchemy on Python 3.4.

Identity(Keystone) notifications have a handler
for Role that has event type as identity.role.*
Another for RoleAssignment which accepts
identity.role_assignment.* events.

Since event types are regular expressions,
an event like identity.role_assignment.created
is matched with identity.role.* and gets incorrectly
routed to the Role Handler.

This fix restricts the event type regex for Role
handler to just identity.role.* events and excludes
identity.role_* events.
