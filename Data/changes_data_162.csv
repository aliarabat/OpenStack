We've seen proxy-servers lock up while trying to log client disconnects.
The trouble is that we happen to do this while we're *already*
trying to log *something else*. If the timing works out particularly
badly, we end up with a double-call to (an eventlet-patched)
threading.current_thread(), which needs to enumerate all pthreads, which
uses a non-re-entrant lock in CPython.

The most expedient solution seems to be disabling logThreads so we never
call threading.current_thread().

The routine to determine which files to check for candidacies, when

those files if they are being kept by the change. If they're being

files which are slated for removal makes it basically impossible to
revert a previously merged candidacy which has since been
invalidated (for example, by resigning OSF Individual Membership).

Since the last time we ran a combined election there were no runoffs
needed, nobody had yet created an end_nominations template for the
combined model. This one is a mashup of the existing PTL and TC
templates, with some patterns borrowed from combined templates for
other events. Also included is a typo fix for the
combined_nominations_last_days template which I just noticed when
referencing it.

This patch fixes the newly encountered issues with the
lower-constraints job (came up with the new pip version with the new
dependency resolver) and sets back the job as voting job.

install_command was not yet removed from tox.ini in stable/stein and
seemingly it is used in lower-constraints job, thus the job fails with
contradicting constraints over package 'coverage'. As a minimal fix
the install_command is added to the lower-constraints tox target, too.

warlock==1.3.0 is set as lower-constraint, but during the installation
a requirement to warlock!=1.3.0 causes failure of the lower-constraints
job.

* pyroute2 version bumped to match os-vif's constraint
* psycopg2 and oslo.messaging bumped to make lower-constraints job pass
* zVMCloudConnector supports python 3.6 only from vesion 1.2.2
* cryptography version needed to be bumped as it conflicts with another
  dependency and causes the new pip resolver to time out at gate

Cinder's release notes to help developers remember.

The template includes a link to the contributor page where we explain
additional details as well as examples for normal and driver features
and fixes.

When a node is created in ovn_hash_ring table, it used to use timestamp
depending on the system or mysql timezone. This caused troubles for
machines using western timezones when getting active nodes before the
first liveness check, becaus the time difference between UTC and local
time was always in hours and the limit is 30 seconds.

This patch configures OVN Hash Ring model to always use UTC when
creating a node so the times are always compared to UTC, regardless of
the used timezone. Note that the created_at and updated_at are not user
facing columns.

Update `cleaning_error_handler` to match with
`deploying_error_handler` that logs all errors and optionally
separates between logged message and `last_error`.

Logged message usually contains node's uuid as there is no
context for node in stream of log entries. `last_error`
usually does not contain node's uuid as it is already
displayed in the context of node.

Impact:
* There were messages that were only added to node's last_error.
Now they are going to be logged too.
* No need to log explicitly before `cleaning_error_handler`. Such
occurrences have been removed.
* Where there were different message for log and last_error it
is kept. Where there was only 1 message, it is left as it is to
be both logged and updated in `last_error`.
* Exception logging is replaced with error logging with traceback.

  TypeError: Value of unknown type: <class

The call to 'self.conn.block_storage.volumes()' returns an instance
of class 'openstack.block_storage.v2.volume.Volume'. This class
inherits from 'openstack.resource.Resource', which is a 'dict'
subclass since 0.19. For older sdk versions prior to 0.19 it was
not, hence we have to use the 'to_dict' function to convert each
'Volume' to 'dict' explicitly.

This feature looks to rename all uses of 'blacklist' and 'whitelist'
to more accurate and appropriate names.

Suggestion is to replace the below options for run command, as follows:
--blacklist-file    >>    --exclude-list
--whitelist-file    >>    --include-list
--black-regex       >>    --exclude-regex

These options map directly to the corresponding options in the stestr
tool. Further, this is inline with similar changes done in stestr, and
made available as part of version 3.1.0.
Issue Ref: https://github.com/mtreinish/stestr/issues/296

For now, new options are added along side the existing ones to avoid
interface break and disruption to users of the API. Later, maybe during
an 'X' or 'Y' version change, the old options can be dropped altogether.
Corresponding unit test code and documentation references for the old
options will also be removed at that time.

In change I60141397f39e3b1b0274230db8d984934c98a08d charmhelper
library is being used in the rabbitmq queue nrpe check. This is
problematic as the check does not actually run in a charm context and
therefore does not have access to the charm environment such as the
current config. Additionally an issue in collating check results had
been introduced.

This change aims to fix these issues. Instead of using the charmhelper
library, the cronspec is read out from the cron job definition
itself, and the series is probed from /etc/lsb-release

I8e349849db0b1a540d295c903f1470917b82fd97 bumped these versions late in
the Victoria cycle and it's time to do the same again during Wallaby.

The new MIN_{LIBVIRT,QEMU}_VERSIONs are:

MIN_LIBVIRT_VERSION = (6, 0, 0)
MIN_QEMU_VERSION = (4, 2, 0)

These versions are met by the three defined LTS distros supported by the
Wallaby release [1][2] of Ubuntu 20.04, CentOS 8 and openSUSE Leap 15.2.

MIN_LIBVIRT_VTPM is removed as part of this patch as it also requires
changes to functional tests that would otherwise fail.

Follow up patches will remove the following constants after this change:

- MIN_LIBVIRT_S390X_CPU_COMPARE
- MIN_{LIBVIRT,QEMU}_BLOCKDEV

Finally, NEXT_MIN_{LIBVIRT,QEMU}_VERSION are also updated to:

NEXT_MIN_LIBVIRT_VERSION = (7, 0, 0)
NEXT_MIN_QEMU_VERSION = (5, 2, 0)

A partial upgrading of neutron cluster, neutron-server
has a newer version while neutron-agents not, does not
run well after a RPC data structure upgrading. This
patch upgrades the security group related RPC version
between neutron-server and agents. A partial upgrading
neutron cluster will explicitly raise error. The RPC
version should be aligned.

The following test classes are not needed anymore because the tested
case is not considered in the OpenStack release roadmap [1]. The DB
migrations considered on these test cases are currently not supported.
Any deployment should have a DB schema newer than the scenarios
tested and therefore those tests are not needed.

Although in most cases the test cases are not revisited, those ones in
particular are quite slow (""test_walk_versions"" takes more than one
minute in a testing environment) and have a particular history of
problems [2][3][4].

When adding a new UDP member or a UDP-CONNECT health-monitor to a UDP
pool, there can be a race condition in the first heartbeat message
sent to the health-manager service.
This message might contain a DOWN status for a working member that
hasn't been checked yet.

This commit introduces a new member status between the amphora-agent and
the health-manager: it indicates that the UDP pool has been updated and
that the status of a member is a transitional state, preventing an
incorrect ERROR status.

Patrole network tests fail when pre-provisioned credentials are
used (Could not find user).

This is caused by missing 'user_id' and 'tenant_id' parameters
in the client manager.

The reason why this happens only with network tests is because
when client manager from neutron_tempest_plugin is created
the set_auth() function which refills the credentials is not
called (in contrast with tempest's get_client_manager() function
where the set_auth() function is called).

This patch makes sure that client manager contains 'user_id'
and 'tenant_id' by refilling the credentials using the set_auth()
function.

=============
This (somewhat) weakens some security protections for requests over the
S3 API; operators may want to preserve the prior behavior by setting

There is no reason to create internal and admin endpoints in DevStack,

Also use the global SERVICE_PROTOCOL variable as default for
OCTAVIA_PROTOCOL instead of ""http"", this will make us automatically
use the secure API access when the tls-proxy service is enabled.

Fix the instructions for using the devstack plugin, too.

The problem here is that this repos haven't doc/requirements.txt file

This requirements file contains extra requirements like flake8 that
collided with those allowed in our job environment and so the new pip

When adding a new UDP member or a UDP-CONNECT health-monitor to a UDP

This message might contain a DOWN status for a working member that

This commit introduces a new member status between the amphora-agent and
the health-manager: it indicates that the UDP pool has been updated and
that the status of a member is a transitional state, preventing an
incorrect ERROR status.

The original patch: Ib2a80afb9223da2c0af6f6add250ffaaa20a316f

First attempt at fixing this issue assumed that the update function
would actually be called again after the initial LB creation, which it
is not. We should ensure that this is called when we do any UDP listener
creation, so the file can be removed if necessary.

The tripleo_free startegy cuts the run time of composable upgrade.
But as each node gets to different point of code there is need to
remove clear_facts part from tripleo-packages. The clear_facts
applies globaly meaning if messaging node looks for distribution
fact while controller runs clear_facts we will fail. The
clear_facts was added to force ansible to reset the
ansible_python_interpreter. This should be avoided by simply
setting default python by alternatives command and it's irelevant
to any other version than stable/train.

We're not going to expose the ability to swap volumes since that's a
things humans should not generally use. From the API docs [1]:

  When updating volumeId, this API is typically meant to only be used
  as part of a larger orchestrated volume migration operation initiated
  in the block storage service via the os-retype or os-migrate_volume
  volume actions. Direct usage of this API to update volumeId is not
  recommended and may result in needing to hard reboot the server to
  update details within the guest such as block storage serial IDs.
  Furthermore, updating volumeId via this API is only implemented by
  certain compute drivers.

We *do* want users to have the ability to change the delete on
termination behavior though, so that's what we expose.

When the resource tracker has to lock a compute host for updates or
inspection, it uses a single semaphore. In most cases, this is fine, as
a compute process only is tracking one hypervisor. However, in Ironic, it's
possible for one compute process to track many hypervisors. In this
case, wait queues for instance claims can get ""stuck"" briefly behind
longer processing loops such as the update_resources periodic job. The
reason this is possible is because the oslo.lockutils synchronized
library does not use fair locks by default. When a lock is released, one
of the threads waiting for the lock is randomly allowed to take the lock
next. A fair lock ensures that the thread that next requested the lock
will be allowed to take it.

This should ensure that instance claim requests do not have a chance of
losing the lock contest, which should ensure that instance build
requests do not queue unnecessarily behind long-running tasks.

This includes bumping the oslo.concurrency dependency; fair locks were
added in 3.29.0 (I37577becff4978bf643c65fa9bc2d78d342ea35a).

operator expected error should've been emitted because of this part:
${IS_ZUUL_FT+yes}. Unset vs set was a bit confusing so this patch not
only fixes the part but forces the var into always being set and changes
it to ""True"" vs ""False"".

Fix empty UDP pools status: a UDP pool without members went OFFLINE

This commit changes the keepalived configuration with empty pools:
the configuration now contains a virtual_server and a comment about the
existing pool. This comment is used by the get_udp_listener_pool_status

stable/rocky was first released in August 2018,
and the final release from this branch (7.4.1)
was made on 12 Mar 2020 [1]. This branch is
currently open only to take necessary third
party driver fixes and maintenance is at best
effort. A number of CI jobs have been broken
on this branch for a while. Let's clean them
up so we don't waste CI resources when backports
are proposed. This definitely implies loss
of test coverage, however, we have to weigh
the cost of repairing these CI jobs against
momentum of maintenance and work for the
future branches.

Jobs being dropped are:

* openstack-lower-constraints
pip's latest dependency resolver unearthed a bunch
of broken dependencies on this branch. Resolving these
would involve bumping the ""lower"" requirements, the
team does not think this will be useful for anyone,
since we will not be altering requirements for this
branch anymore.
* manila-tempest-dsvm-mysql-generic and
The reference generic driver had four jobs on this
branch, manila-tempest-dsvm-generic-no-share-servers.
We can cut it down to two by dropping coverage
for the DHSS=False configuration and multibackend,
both of which are tested in the other jobs, albeit
with other backends.
* manila-tempest-minimal-dsvm-lvm-centos-7
This is a lost cause, we don't expect to fix
devstack on centos-7 anytime soon for these
old extended maintenance branches (See bug#1888717)
* manila-rally-multibackend and
manila-rally-multibackend-no-ss - these rally
jobs have been broken for a while, there's
barely any reason to think we'll cause performance
regressions in the API on this branch and use
these jobs to judge them.

Also drop all the experimental jobs and remove
""openstack-tox-cover"" from the post queue.

qemu-img convert makes a number of allocation requests, and less
common than the ""Resource temporarily unavailable"" error is
""Cannot allocate memory"". The first seems to be largely raised
upon a thread creation for the image conversion, where the first
appears to be on buffer setup on the original process.

Regardless, we should check for both and retry conversion
automatically.

Note: Because of a later patch which transformed the retry logic to
leverage tenacity, this change has been modified accordingly.

In newer versions we've switched out the default network configuration
to actually be configured. However in Train, folks may have already
deployed with the existing configuration so we can't switch the

when needed but by default will still blank the network configuration as
previously done.

It should be noted that the default interface was changed in later
versions from cni0 to cni-podman0 see podman 3755 (podman > 1.6).

This change also adds the login molecule jobs back in that were removed
in the initial docker to podman conversion due to the lack of network
configuration.

qemu-img convert makes a number of allocation requests, and less
common than the ""Resource temporarily unavailable"" error is
""Cannot allocate memory"". The first seems to be largely raised
upon a thread creation for the image conversion, where the first
appears to be on buffer setup on the original process.

Regardless, we should check for both and retry conversion
automatically.

In case if during switching HA router to be down, there will be any
failure, router_info will be stored in L3 agent's cache as HaRouter.
In case when next update on the router is migration to non-HA router
this is wrong class and it causes other issues, e.g. with
remove_vip_by_ip_address() which is correct only for HA routers.

This patch fixes that issue by adding check of the router's ha and
distributed flags and update local cache with new router_info class
in case if at least one of those flags don't match.

Kayobe allows specifying a --limit argument, which is passed through to
Ansible. In some cases we wish to add an intersection with a group. This
allows us to reuse playbooks for the seed, overcloud etc.

For example, the lvm.yml playbook specifies a host list of
seed-hypervisor:seed:overcloud. When executed as part of a kayobe
overcloud host configure command, Kayobe passes a limit of overcloud. If
the user specifies a --limit argument, this gets intersected with the
overcloud limit: host1:&overcloud.

The problem happens if the user specifies multiple parts to the host
pattern in their limit using a comma, e.g. host1,host2. This results in
host1,host2:&overcloud. Ansible ignores the colon, and treats this as
host1 or host2:&overcloud.

The solution is to use a comma to join the patterns if the user has used
a comma: host1,host2,&overcloud

When the OVN Octavia Provider driver calls into
octavia-lib to update the status of a loadbalancer,
it might fail. This can happen if a resource associated
with the loadbalancer was not found, for example, if
it's DB transaction was in-flight.

A side-effect is the resource can become ""stuck"":

$ openstack loadbalancer listener delete $ID
Load Balancer $ID is immutable and cannot be updated.

The provider driver needs to retry the operation,
typically even the very next call succeeds.

Also had to fix a minor pep8 issue in test_checks.py

Removing specific doc requirements from test-requirements.txt.

The problem here is that this repos haven't doc/requirements.txt file
and by default in this case zuul will use the test-requirements.txt file
to pull requirements [4].

This requirements file contains extra requirements like flake8 that
collided with those allowed in our job environment and so the new pip
resolver fails to install these requirements and the job exits in error.

This project meet the conditions leading to the bug.

Notice that pymod2pkg isn't released by the openstack/release team due
to the recent SIG move, however standardization can't hurt.

Changes prompted by the new pip resolver doing stricter dependency
checking:
- req, lc: cinder to 17.0.0 (victoria official release)
- lc: os-brick: 2.7.0 -> 4.0.1 (victoria official release)
- lc: stevedore: 1.20.0 -> 1.31.0 (version in victoria cinder l-c)
- update test-req to match cinder stable/victoria versions
- added some indirect dependencies to test-requirements.txt to help
  speed up dependency resolution

This patch is picking up an updated flake8 that is more strict
about import order checking, so we add a per-file-ignore config
option to tox.ini to turn off E402 detection for the affected
files.  See comment in cinderlib/cinder.py for details.  NOTE:
per-file-ignores requires flake8>=3.7.0, but we don't specify
that here because the flake8 version is controlled by hacking.

Disabled UDP listeners appeared as ONLINE, as the heartbeat message
always showed listeners as OPEN, even if disabled.

This commit fixes the configuration file for UDP listeners, previously
enabling or disabling a UDP listener created the same config file. Now
disabling a UDP listener explicitly adds a comment in the file.

Based on this comment, the heartbeat message doesn't include status
updates for disabled UDP listeners.

baremetal deployments. Any instnace with 'managed: false'
must either have a 'fixed_ip' defining the IP address
of the already provisioned server. Or it must have a
'management_ip' set.

Adds module: tripleo_unmanaged_populate_environment
which merges the 'managed: false' instance to the
baremetal environment.

Adding the support for 'managed' in the YAML used to
define a baremetal deployment provides a unified UX for
pre-provisioned and ironic/metalsmith provisioned
instances. It also keeps the interface to manage neutron
ports for composable networks identical for for
pre-provisioned and ironic/metalsmith instances.

pip 20.3 brings in a strict dependency resolver which
is enabled by default. This dependency resolver
unearthed the error in our tox file where we
were constraining our lower-constraints job with both
upper and lower constraints files.

The upper constraint file was being pulled in because
we had an unnecessary ""pip install"" command added as
""install_command"". We have removed the use of
install_command from ussuri [1]; but the older branches
need to be addressed.

As a result of fixing our tests, we're also
having to update the lower bounds of some
requirements on this branch.

Version changes for direct dependencies:
* eventlet (0.18.2 --> 0.24.1)
(0.25.2 is the upper-constraint)
* oslo.messaging (5.29.0 --> 6.4.1)
(6.4.1 was released 2018 June, during Rocky [4]
upper-constraint is 9.5.2)
* oslo.service (1.24.0 --> 1.31.0)
(1.31.0 was released 2018 April, during Rocky [5]
upper-constraint is 1.38.1)
* psycopg2-binary (2.6.2-->2.8.3)
(psycopg2-binary is a unit test requirement)

Version changes for transitive dependencies:
* MarkupSafe (1.0 --> 1.1.1)
(1.1.1 is the upper-constraint)
* psutil (5.4.3 --> 5.6.3)
(5.6.3 is the upper-constraint)

As per the community goal of migrating the policy file
the format from JSON to YAML[1], we need to do two things:

1. Change the default value of '[oslo_policy] policy_file''

upgrade checks.

2. Deprecate the JSON formatted policy file on the project side
via warning in doc and releasenotes.

Also replace policy.json to policy.yaml ref from doc and tests.

So if code is upgraded to N+1 and the upgrade check was run before
the restart of the services with N+1 code then the check warns for N-1
computes in the system.

There are small modification in the documentation and code comment to
align it to the Victoria context.

When a compute node has zero total available for the:

  * MEMORY_MB
  * DISK_GB
  * VGPU
  * PMEM_NAMESPACE_*

resource classes, we attempt to PUT an inventory with 'total' of 0
which isn't allowed by the placement API. Doing this results in a 400
error from placement ""JSON does not validate: 0 is less than the
minimum of 1"" and ResourceProviderUpdateFailed and
ResourceProviderSyncFailed raised in nova.

We are already omitting most resource classes when their total amount
of the resource is 0 and we just need to also do it for the
aforementioned resource classes.

In order to make rgw a better drop-in replacement for Swift, this
patch does two things:

* Configure rgw to include the Swift account in its URL
* Update the Keystone catalog entry so that the rgw endpoints
  include the AUTH_%(tenant_id)s suffix (just like the os_swift
  role does)

Both of the above are necessary to make both public read ACLs
and temp URLs work with rgw, the way they do with native Swift.

In addition, the patch also:

* Removes the rgw_s3_auth_use_keystone config override, which
  is useless in the default configuration that does not enable
  the S3 API.
* Adds documentation to the users guide, about using rgw as a
  Swift replacement.
* Adds a release note detailing possible upgrade issues.

This commit allows including OSA global constraints when installing
tempest plugins.  In gating, this includes openstack-ansible's
global-requirement-pins.txt via a URL.  In a full deployment, it
includes requirements_absolute_requirements.txt as retrieved from the
repo server, to which openstack-ansible/global-requirement-pins.txt was
accounted for in the repo build process.

Pulling the neutron repo into tempest is unnecessary since tests
are run using the neutron-tempest-plugin or repo-specific plugins.
This patch removes neutron from tempest_plugins.

When updating variables that would result in a modified
tempest.conf, the /root/.tempest/etc/tempest.conf or
/etc/tempest.conf would get updated properly.  A tempest
init happens after and does not copy those into an
existing workspace.  This change allows backup workspaces
to be kept on each modification to keep from loosing any
existing workspaces.

DVR is a default in OVN. Previously we had a dvr environment file, that
overrode the default True to explicit True. The other environment file
that doesn't specify DVR left the default True but removed the bridge
mappings from compute nodes leading to a state where Neutron server was
configured DVR but compute nodes were not. The environment files are
confusing this way and thus patch removes the bridge mappings from the
file.

This patch changes the DVR environment file to non-dvr, explicitly
disabling DVR. And leaves the environment files that don't specify DVR
in their names to defautl behavior.
