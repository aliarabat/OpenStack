The linked bug shows the install of the charm with openstack-origin set
to zed.  This happens because configure_installation_source() causes the
openstack-release package to be installed *before* the zed cloud archive
sources are configured into /etc/apt and an apt update done. This means
that the openstack-release package says ""yoga"" despite the zed packages
actually being installed.

Then, on the config-changed hook, it sees that the installed version is
showing as yoga and tries to do an upgrade.  This fails, as the charm
hasn't yet bootstrapped, and the charm tries to bootstrap after
upgrading the packages.

There's a few bugs here which are exposed, but the tactical fix is to
force the openstack-release to match the installed packages.

os-vif 1.15.0 added the ability to create an OVS port during plugging
by specifying the 'create_port' attribute in the 'port_profile' field.
By delegating port creation to os-vif, we can rely on it's 'isolate_vif'
config option [1] that will temporarily configure the VLAN to 4095
(0xfff), which is reserved for implementation use [2] and is used by
neutron to as a dead VLAN [3]. By doing this, we ensure VIFs are plugged
securely, preventing guests from accessing other tenants' networks
before the neutron OVS agent can wire up the port.

This change requires a little dance as part of the live migration flow.
Since we can't be certain the destination host has a version of os-vif
that supports this feature, we need to use a sentinel to indicate when
it does. Typically we would do so with a field in
'LibvirtLiveMigrateData', such as the 'src_supports_numa_live_migration'
and 'dst_supports_numa_live_migration' fields used to indicate support
for NUMA-aware live migration. However, doing this prevents us
backporting this important fix since o.vo changes are not backportable.
Instead, we (somewhat evilly) rely on the free-form nature of the
'VIFMigrateData.profile_json' string field, which stores JSON blobs and
is included in 'LibvirtLiveMigrateData' via the 'vifs' attribute, to
transport this sentinel. This is a hack but is necessary to work around
the lack of a free-form ""capabilities"" style dict that would allow us do
backportable fixes to live migration features.

Note that this change has the knock on effect of modifying the XML
generated for OVS ports: when hybrid plug is false will now be of type
'ethernet' rather than 'bridge' as before. This explains the larger than
expected test damage but should not affect users.

NOTE(stephenfin): Change I362deb1088c88cdcd8219922da9dc9a01b10a940
(""objects: Fix VIFMigrateData.supports_os_vif_delegation setter"") which
contains an important fix for the original change, is squashed into this
change. In addition, the os-vif version bump we introduced in the
original version of this patch is not backportable and as a result, we
must introduce two additional checks. Both checks ensure we have a
suitable version of os-vif and skip the new code paths if not. The first
check is in the libvirt driver's 'check_can_live_migrate_destination'
function, which as the name suggests runs on the destination host early
in the live migration process. If os-vif is not new enough on the
destination, we will report that we cannot support os-vif delegation.
The other check is in the '_nova_to_osvif_vif_ovs' helper in
'nova.network.os_vif_util'. This simply ensures we don't try to set an
invalid attribute on the os-vif object if the version isn't new enough.
Two tests are modified to accommodate these checks with similar version
check logic. The lower-constraints job can be relied on to validate
behavior on the older version of os-vif.

os-vif 1.15.0 added the ability to create an OVS port during plugging
by specifying the 'create_port' attribute in the 'port_profile' field.
By delegating port creation to os-vif, we can rely on it's 'isolate_vif'
config option [1] that will temporarily configure the VLAN to 4095
(0xfff), which is reserved for implementation use [2] and is used by
neutron to as a dead VLAN [3]. By doing this, we ensure VIFs are plugged
securely, preventing guests from accessing other tenants' networks
before the neutron OVS agent can wire up the port.

This change requires a little dance as part of the live migration flow.
Since we can't be certain the destination host has a version of os-vif
that supports this feature, we need to use a sentinel to indicate when
it does. Typically we would do so with a field in
'LibvirtLiveMigrateData', such as the 'src_supports_numa_live_migration'
and 'dst_supports_numa_live_migration' fields used to indicate support
for NUMA-aware live migration. However, doing this prevents us
backporting this important fix since o.vo changes are not backportable.
Instead, we (somewhat evilly) rely on the free-form nature of the
'VIFMigrateData.profile_json' string field, which stores JSON blobs and
is included in 'LibvirtLiveMigrateData' via the 'vifs' attribute, to
transport this sentinel. This is a hack but is necessary to work around
the lack of a free-form ""capabilities"" style dict that would allow us do
backportable fixes to live migration features.

Note that this change has the knock on effect of modifying the XML
generated for OVS ports: when hybrid plug is false will now be of type
'ethernet' rather than 'bridge' as before. This explains the larger than
expected test damage but should not affect users.

NOTE(stephenfin): The conflicts aren't as bad (well, as complex) as you
would think from the raw file count. The conflicts in the 'fake_network'

module are due to change If56842da51688476072814e6e8309cf9e0a0210c
(""libvirt: flatten rbd image during cross-cell move spawn at dest"") and
change Id80fd1f68c0bb3b2d3af6e139b3d163acaef081d (""libvirt: Remove

'nova.virt.libvirt.driver' is due to some reshuffling of the glance
module from change I7ca7d8a92dfbc7c8d0ee2f9e660eabaa7e220e2a (""Remove

Nova has never supported specifying per numa node
cpu toplogies. Logically the  cpu toplogy of a guest
is independent of its numa toplogy and there is no
way to model different cpu toplogies per numa node
or implement that in hardware.

The presence of the code in nova that allowed the generation
of these invalid configuration has now been removed as it
broke the automatic selection of cpu topologies based
on hw:max_[cpus|sockets|threads] flavor and image properties.

This change removed the incorrect code and related unit

The presence of the code in nova that allowed the generation

NOTE(stephenfin): As expected, this was the hairiest of the backports so
far due to the absence of changes from 'cpu-resources' series. With that
said, most of the ""hairiness"" is in the functional test, given we're
missing tests from change Ie38aa625dff543b5980fd437ad2febeba3b50079
(""Add support for translating CPU policy extra specs, image meta"") and
its ilk. The actual test itself is unchanged from stable/train, however.
The conflicts in the code itself are far more trivial and are caused by
the absence of changes Ie38aa625dff543b5980fd437ad2febeba3b50079 and
I6381365ff882cf23808e8dabfce41143c5e35192 (""hacking: Resolve W503 (line

In the recently released importlib-metadata 5.0.0 package a number of
breaking changes where made to the interface (in fact that was the only
change for the release removing a bunch of things tagged as deprecated).
Since Python 3.7 depends on this library to function for querying
package metadata these breaking API changes cause anything using
stevedore to fail when 5.0.0 is installed. To workaround these issues
this commit sets a version cap on importlib-metadata to avoid using the
version which is incompatible with stevedore.

importlib-metadata 5.0 has removed support for dict-style interaction
with entrypoints [1]. This is going to eventually affect us when Python
3.12 is released but even before then anyone not properly using upper
constraints with an older Python 3.7-based release (the only Python
version where we require the third-party importlib-metadata package
rather than the stdlib importlib.metadata package) will be bitten. Fix
it now to address both.

`which` is not a default package for CentOS 9 and Rocky Linux. This
means that we should either take care of installing `which` at very
beginning or use built-in alternative of `command -v`.
Command is part of GNU Bash package and will present on each system
which have bash installed, which is OSA requirements.

`command -v` behaves exactly same way - it provides path as output
and exits with code 1 when binary can't be found. So it's a drop-in
replacement.

This tags the final release for all cycle-with-rc projects for Zed.
While not required, having PTLs ack this patch would be nice to include
that record in the merged metadata.

Release activity should now be frozen until this is processed on
October 5th. Any bugfixes merged to stable/zed can be queued up and
ready to go as a follow on stable release after the coordinated release
date.

There are different diff-start values for each project. This is used
when generating release notes to denote the point where the stable/yoga
branch started to diverge from what is included on stable/zed. For
some, this will be the final Yoga major version, but if multiple RCs
were done, this may show the initial RC1 release version. This is
normal.

This patch will be merged on October 5th.

Global Request IDs were introduced a while ago[1] so that operators can
trace processing of resources across multiple services more easily.

Some services like Nova or Neutron have implemented this feature and
a request made by these services have additional global request id in
its context. However current default format doesn't include that new id
and users need to update the log format parameter in each service to
get this information recorded.

This change updates the default log format so that the Global Request
IDs can be more widely and easily used.

This patch does multiple things:
1) Extends the virt interface to pass share_info down to the driver an update the signatures in all in tree drivers.
2) Extends the compute manager to pass the share_info to the driver at certain actions.
3) Implement the share_info handling in the libvirt driver.
3.1) Checks requirements for shares and reports the new capabilities COMPUTE_STORAGE_VIRTIO_FS and
COMPUTE_MEM_BACKING_FILE to signal that.
3.2) Extends the config handling for virtio mounts.
3.3) Implements mount / unmount.
4) Changes the scheduler to request new capabilities.

Manila is the OpenStack Shared Filesystems service.
These series of patches implement changes required in Nova to allow the shares
provided by Manila to be associated with and attached to instances using
virtiofs.

When:
* the segments service plugin is enabled and
* we have multiple rpc worker processes (as in the sum of rpc_workers
  and rpc_state_report_workers, since both kind processes agent
  state_reports) and
* many ovs-agents report physnets,
then rabbitmq dispatches the state_report messages between the workers
in a round robin fashion, therefore eventually the state_reports of the
same agent will hit all rpc workers.

Unfortunately all worker processes have a 'reported_hosts' set to
remember from which host it has seen agent reports already. But right
after a server start when that set is still empty, each worker will
unconditionally write the received physnet-segment information into
the db. This means we multiply the load on the db and rpc workers by
a factor of the rpc worker count.

This patch tries to reduce the load on the db by adding another early
return before the unconditional db write.

LVM target drivers usually only support unique subsystems/targets, so a
specific subsystem/target is created for each volume.

While this is good from a deployment point of view, it is insufficient
from a testing perspective, since it limits the code paths that can be
tested in os-brick.

Being able to test these 2 different paths in os-brick is very
important, because the shared case usually present very particular
issues: Leftover devices caused by race conditions between nova and
cinder, premature subsystem/target disconnection, not disconnecting
subsystem/target, etc.

Thanks to this patch we'll be able to increase the testing possibilities
of the NVMe-oF os-brick connector to cover combinations of:

- Different connection properties formats: old & new
- Different target sharing: shared & non shared

The LVM driver assumes that all connecting hosts will have the iSCSI
initiator installed and configured. If they don't, then there won't be
an ""initiator"" key in the connector properties dictionary and the call
to terminate connection will always fail with a KeyError exception on
the 'initiator' key.

This is the case if we don't have iSCSI configured on the computes
because we are only using NVMe-oF volumes with the nvmet target.

This patch starts using the dictionary ``get`` method so there is no
failure even when the keys don't exist, and it also differentiates by
target type so they target the identifier they care about, which is the
``initiator`` for iSCSI and ``nqn`` for NVMe-oF.

Ultimately, this is something that should be fixed in python-ovs,
but setting the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option benefits the client by
removing the need to send 'echo' requests, which can time out on
an overloaded ovsdb-server, which causes a disconnection which then#
adds even more load on the ovsdb-server as it has to send the entire
db contents over the wire after the connection is restored.

This patch ports the optimisation form neutron to reduce the likelyhood
of a reconnection which can cause the nova compute agent to hang
temporarily while the connection is reestablished.

As jaraco notes in bug 1942209 [1]:

  In the later releases of importlib_metadata [ref], performance of
  loading entry points has been dramatically improved, including much
  faster discovery/loading and an in-memory cache for entry points for a
  running process.

  These performance gains are measured and tracked in the CI runs for
  importlib_metadata.

  If possible, this project should consider removing its own cache in
  favor of the built-in caching in importlib_metadata (also
  importlib.metadata in Python 3.10). Doing so should also address
  #1627906 and would limit the dependencies on the data model (such as
  construction of EntryPoint objects).

  [ref] https://importlib-metadata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html

importlib-metadata clearly isn't a stable API so anything that allows us
to reduce the amount of APIs we are exposed to is a good thing. This
does require reintroducing the need for importlib-metadata (the third
party lib) in some of the older versions of Python but that's a
temporary measure at best that will eventually result in us being closer
to upstream.

For now, we cannot remove nft rules like we do with iptables[1]. While
this feature is apparently a goal, we need to rely on the rule handle.

Since all of the TripleO managed rules are supposed to get a comment,
let's use that feature to target the rule we want to remove.

Some notes to keep in mind:
- this addition is done to manage temporary rule
- this addition doesn't take care of files having that rule added in
  order to recreate it upon nftables restart
- hopefully we'll be able to move to a more convenient way to remove
  rules, though using a comment is pretty convenient in order to filter
  it
- if multiple rules have the same comment, all of them will be removed

This adds support for deleting OVN controller/metadata agents.
Behavior is undefined if the agents are still actually up as per
the Agent API docs.

As part of this, it is necessary to be able to tell all workers
that the agent is gone. This can't be done by deleting the
Chassis, because ovn-controller deletes the Chassis if it is
stopped gracefully and we need to still display those agents as
down until ovn-controller is restarted. This also means we can't
write a value to the Chassis marking the agent as 'deleted'
because the Chassis may not be there. And of course you can't
use the cache because then other workers won't see that the
agent is deleted.

Due to the hash ring implementation, we also cannot naively just
send some pre-defined event that all workers can listen for to
update their status of the agent. Only one worker would process
the event. So we need some kind of GLOBAL event type that is
processed by all workers.

When the hash ring implementation was done, the agent API
implementation was redesigned to work around moving from having
a single OVN Worker to having distributed events. That
implementation relied on marking the agents 'alive' in the
OVSDB. With large numbers of Chassis entries, this induces
significant load, with 2 DB writes per Chassis per
cfg.CONF.agent_down_time / 2 seconds (37 by default).

This patch reverts that change and goes back to using events
to store agent information in the cache, but adds support for
""GLOBAL"" events that are run on each worker that uses a particular
connection.

When port with IP address from the auto allocation subnet (SLAAC or
dhcp_stateless) is created or updated and fixed IP address is specified,
Neutron will fail as in case of such subnets IP address is assigned
automatically based on the subnet's prefix and port's MAC address.
But in case when given IP address is actually correct EUI64 generated IP
address (the same as Neutron would generate for that port) there is no
need to raise an exception and fail request.

Additionally this patch fixes imports sections in the
ipam_pluggable_backend module.

A new script to remove the duplicated port bindings was added. This
script will list all ``ml2_port_bindings`` records in the database,
finding those ones with the same port ID. Then the script removes
those ones with status=INACTIVE. This script is useful to remove
those leftovers that remain in the database after a failed live
migration.

""dry_run"" mode is possible if selected in ""[cli_script] dry_run""
boolean config option. The duplicated port bindings are printed in

Charms for OpenStack Yoga supports both Ubuntu Focal and Jammy
which means Python 3.8 and Python 3.10.  Managing dependencies
across those two versions is non-trivial and we need to build
the charm on the series the charm is supposed to support.

Switch to using a binary build which allows pip's dependency
resolution to work.

This patch also drops the impish bundle and fixes channels
for auxiliary charms.

Update metadata with jammy support.

Replace `octavia.setup.ensure_lts_images` with the default glance
lts image configure job.

Drop python build dependencies in wheelhouse and let the binary
build figure those out automatically.

openstack%2Frequirements~master~I85501b4bff97d1c1e1873c3329ef998a8e501134,openstack/requirements,master,uncap-importlib-metadata,I85501b4bff97d1c1e1873c3329ef998a8e501134,Allow backports to have arbitrary python_version markers,MERGED,2022-07-15 15:06:17.000000000,2022-10-04 11:24:30.000000000,2022-08-03 01:50:46.000000000,30,9,7,850020,a968919ebe3cd8d25df293d5d5f1eefadd79d542,22,3,3,1,15334,Stephen Finucane,sfinucan,"Allow backports to have arbitrary python_version markers

There are a number of backport packages in place for packages in stdlib
that are still evolving. One such package is 'importlib-metadata' which
is a backport of 'importlib.metadata'. The README [1] for this package
shows a mapping of versions of the 'importlib-metadata' third party
library to versions of stdlib 'importlib.metadata':

  importlib_metadata  stdlib
  4.8                 3.11
  4.4                 3.10
  1.4                 3.8

A project may want to use a shiny new feature only found in the Python
3.11 stdlib version while continuing to support Python 3.8, 3.9 and
3.10. If so, they could specify something like so:

  importlib-metadata>=4.8;python_version<3.11

Meanwhile, other packages might require features found in the Python
3.10 stdlib version. They would want to specify something like so:

  importlib-metadata>=4.4;python_version<3.10

Currently this is not possible as it is not possible to specify
arbitrary 'python_version' markers. Since 'importlib-metadata' does not
have a 'python_version' marker in 'global-requirements.txt' (not since
change I5febaed02e95ff27accd946abc32f3bcbb1a5ead anyway), both projects
would have to specify

  importlib-metadata>={required_version}

Which means they'll use importlib-metadata even where they don't need
it.

Fix this issue by allowing a list of particular modules to specify a
project-specific 'python_version' marker. Currently this list only
includes 'importlib-metadata', but in the future we may wish to enhance
it to include other rolling backport libraries (e.g. mock).

The os-brick nvmeof connector supports  2 different connection
properties formats, the original one and a later one that added support
to multiple portals as well as replicated devices for a software RAID.

Targets that inherit from the nvmeof base target (spdk and nvmet)
supported the original connection properties format, but it was decided
that new features, such as multipathing, would only be added to os-brick
in the new format code path.

This patch adds support to the nvmeof target class (and specifically to
the nvmet target, though it should work for other as well) for the new
connection properties format to enable support for future features.

Support for the old connection properties has been maintained, and is
still the default, since we need an easy way to exert the old code path
in os-brick to ensure that the code still works.

Configuration option ``nvmeof_new_conn_info`` is used to select what
version of the connection properties the nvmet target should use.

Per discussion amongst the Ironic cores[0], the consensus
was built to shorten the allocations ``name`` field length
in order to (a) maintain a unique name constraint per allocation,
(b) and not have to change the field type in the long run.

This is largely due to a constraint in the database architecture[1][2]
when combined with 4 Byte UTF-8 encoding.

As such, an upgrade check is needed to cleanly communicate this
through to users of prior versions of Ironic.
This change should likely be backported possibly as far as
Wallaby to provide advance notice to operators.

The nvmet target was using the nvmetcli command to manage the NVMe-oF
targets, but the command has a big limitation when it comes to
controlling it's behaviour through the command line, as it can only
restore all its configuration and small parts, such as ports or
subsystems, cannot be directly modified without entering into the
interactive mode.

Due to this limitation the nvmet target would:

- Save current nvmet configuration
- Make changes to the json data
- Restore the updated configuration

The problem with this process, besides being slow because it runs a CLI
command and uses temporary files, is that the restoration completely
deletes EVERYTHING, before recreating it again.  This means that all
hosts that are connected to volumes will suddenly experience a
disconnect to the volumes (because the namespace and subsystems have
disappeared) and will keep retrying to connect.  The reconnect succeeds
after the configuration has been restored by nvmet, but that's 10 to 20
seconds that hosts cannot access volumes (this may block things in VMs)
and will present nnvme kernel log error messages.

To fix all these issues, speed and disconnect, this patch stops using
the nvmetcli as a CLI and uses it as a Python library, since that's the
most feature rich functionality of nvmetcli.

Querying the nvmet system can be done directly with the library, but to
make changes (create/destroy ports, subsystems, namespaces) it requires
privileges, so this patch adds a privsep wrapper for the operations that
we use and cannot be done as a normal user.

The nvmet wrapper doesn't provide privsep support for ALL operations,
only for those that we currently use.

Due to the client-server architecture of privsep and nvmet using non
primitive instances as parameters, the privsep wrapper needs custom
serialization code to pass these instances.

As a side effect of the refactoring we also fix a bug were we tried to
create the port over and over again on each create_export call which
resulted in nvme kernel warning logs.

the provisioning network cloud-init correctly configures
the interfaces.

Add --conf-file=/dev/null to ensure no unwanted loading
of config from the dnsmasq default config file path.

The OpenStack stein release repositories are no longer
used since there is no CentOS 9 Stream build. The Openstack
packages was only required for os-net-config.

With this change CentOS 7 is no longer supported as OS for
the dhcpv6-relay instance.

Also add ""Configuration for Routed Networks IPv6"" to

We also make sure that the same mechanism is available for

We remove the ignore error as it's wrong indication that we are not

- Testing ci is different and we don't need that part of the patch;
- podman_image instead of full containers.podman.podman_image as this

The delete operation of an LB lists all references to it (LS and
LR) and in a single transaction deletes them together with the
LB itself. If any of those deletions raise a RowNotFound exception,
the execution will report ERROR status.

This patch will reduce those situations, rechecking the command
that triggers the RowNotFound exception and passing in case a LS
or a LR was the culprit, deleting finally the LB and reporting as
a DELETED status. In other case, the exception is raised and
finally the LB will be reported as ERROR status.

This reverts commit c43d69c5d8a1be9c9e2069fd84a8c205b2eeb39a.

Reason for revert:
We need this fix in stable/wallaby but this change can't be backported
because it is not compatible with CentOS 8. To make the solution
consistent between wallaby and master, we revert this and redo fixing
the problem in a different approach.

The latest release 1.9.1 of Ansible OpenStack Collection [1] is
compatible only to openstacksdk <0.99.0. Until the former has been
fixed, a workaround [2] is required in Bifrost to pin both the
Ansible OpenStack Collection as well as openstacksdk.

These pinned versions will be overwritten when their repositories
are listed in job.required-projects in .zuul.yaml, which we do in
the master branch of Ansible OpenStack collection [3] for both jobs
bifrost-collections-src and bifrost-keystone-collections-src.

This has two side effects: First, Bifrost's CI jobs use the master
branch of both openstacksdk and Ansible OpenStack Collection for
both bifrost-*collections-* jobs which thus differ from other
Bifrost jobs that use pinned releases.
Second, it causes a chicken-and-egg problem: Applying a breaking
change to module openstack.cloud.baremetal_node [4] will break
Bifrost but could easily be fixed [5]. The fix would be backward
compatible to previous releases of Ansible OpenStack Collection
and openstacksdk. But merging that fix [5] without patching
module openstack.cloud.baremetal_port [6] first would break the
bifrost-*collections-* jobs. The patch for openstack.cloud.\
baremetal_port [6] would break bifrost-*collections-* jobs
without the Bifrost fix [5].

The solution is to use the last known working releases of
Ansible OpenStack collection and openstacksdk in both
bifrost-*collections-* jobs like all other Bifrost jobs already
do.

Once we release Ansible OpenStack collection 2.0.0, we simply
have to revert Dmitry's workaround [2] and this patch.

The delete operation of an LB lists all references to it (LS and
LR) and in a single transaction deletes them together with the
LB itself. If any of those deletions raise a RowNotFound exception,
the execution will report ERROR status.

This patch will reduce those situations, rechecking the command
that triggers the RowNotFound exception and passing in case a LS
or a LR was the culprit, deleting finally the LB and reporting as
a DELETED status. In other case, the exception is raised and
finally the LB will be reported as ERROR status.

Latest versions of podman have dropped the AUDIT_WRITE capability from
the default list. This creates a regression in our container, showing an
error log whenever `sudo' is called, and misleading operators, devs and
users regarding the actual root cause of their issue.

Re-allowing the AUDIT_WRITE will remove those red-herring, while
ensuring a consistent log content, especially for containers running
without root user.

This patch takes advantage of the /etc/containers/containers.conf.d
directory, and creates per-section files in there.

Note that, when you're passing a list of value, it will be correctly
written as a coma separated list, within square brackets. This is
the expetected output (TOML).

Please also note that we have to set the full capability list, since the
file format (TOML) isn't really convenient for edition via ansible -
there's no plugin for that, and we can't easily take the existing
capabilities (there's an ""ini"" lookup, but since it's a lookup(), it's
local to the ansible controller, so we can't really rely on it. And it's
not an INI file anyway).

Please also note that AUDIT_WRITE doesn't allow *read*, which is another
capability, nor *control*, which is yet another one[1]. There's
therefore not that many issues re-adding this capability.

Charms for OpenStack Yoga supports both Ubuntu Focal and Jammy

across those two versions is non-trivial and we need to build
the charm on the series the charm is supposed to support.

Switch to using a binary build which allows pip's dependency
resolution to work.

This patch also drops the impish bundle and drops
test-requirements for < py36.

We've seen S3 clients expecting to be able to send request lines like

    GET https://cluster.domain/bucket/key HTTP/1.1

instead of the expected

    GET /bucket/key HTTP/1.1

Testing against other, independent servers with something like

    ( echo -n $'GET https://www.google.com/ HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.google.com\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n' ; sleep 1 ) | openssl s_client -connect www.google.com:443

suggests that it may be reasonable to accept them; the RFC even goes so
far as to say

> To allow for transition to the absolute-form for all requests in some
> future version of HTTP, a server MUST accept the absolute-form in
> requests, even though HTTP/1.1 clients will only send them in
> requests to proxies.

(See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-5.3.2)

Fix it at the protocol level, so everywhere else we can mostly continue
to assume that PATH_INFO starts with a / like we always have.

When deploying Manila CephFS NFS with cephadm,
the manila share service fails to start with the error
""Backend cephfsnfs supports neither IPv4 nor IPv6"".

This happens because the NFS Ganesha daemon fails
to start for some reason and therefore the driver never
gets the location of the NFS Ganesha service
that will be used as the backend.

We should raise an error in this case with more information
about the failure.

This change adds this to the NFSClusterProtocol helper.

The octavia_tls_proxy container might be deployed in an old Queens
deployment but the container should be deleted when the deployment is
updated/upgraded to one of
 - Latest Queens (before to Train)
 - Rocky
so the cleanup step is no longer required in Stein and later.

While auditing a shard container that is in a shrinking state, the
sharder will merge any shard ranges fetched from the root that cover
the shard's namespace. Previously this was conditional upon the
sharder also fetching the shard's *own* shard range from the
root. However, in extreme circumstances, the shard's own shard range
could become deleted and reclaimed from the root while the shard DB
still needs to shrink to its acceptor ranges. This patch therefore
allows the shard to be updated with potential acceptor ranges from the
root even when its own shard range is not fetched from the root.

Also change the log level from debug to info when logging an update to
a shard's own shard range from root.

The commit [1] added a THT parameter that can set the maximum number of
disks that can be attached to a single guest. Refactored VirtioSCSIDisk
into ultimately three new classes.

 * VirtioSCSIBase - parent class hold standard setup and supporting
   methods for test cases
 * VirtioSCSIDiskMultiAttachment - repuprose of the test methods from
   VirtioSCSIDisk which are meant to test guest support of six or more
   disks
 * VirtioSCSIDiskRestrictAttachments - New test method that validates
   [1] is being enforced correctly.

Since [1] could be set to a value less than six, added skip checks for
VirtioSCSIDiskMultiAttachment if the max allowed disks that can be
attached are six or less.

currently this command tries to fetch extra_specs for any flavor
that does not have them (which is quite usual), regardless if the
command was even asked to display them (--long) at all.
This significantly slows down this command as it makes a lot of
unnecessary REST calls, one per each flavor to fetch extra_specs for.

With this patch, client only attempts to fetch flavor extra_specs if
the user actually called the client with --long.

Switching the FirewallEngine to nftables instead of puppet has some
consequences regarding security: the new tripleo_nftables acts on the
chain policy instead of relying on a final drop rule.

`iptables' cli cannot see nftables content we inject, since we're
using the ""inet"" family. Therefore, please use the `nft' CLI from
now on. Doc has been updated accordingly.

During update we skip a lot tasks because we loop over the same update
step task file, changing the step variable, wasting time and
clobbering logs.

To solve the skipped tasks this, we now loop over the stepX file
generated for update and post update.

Expanding the playbook to import the tasks and setting the step
variable has another benefit.  It opens the possibility to use
""start-at-tasks"" as everything is imported.  Using loop variable and
include_tasks prevented its usage.

The 'neutron tag-replace' command is equivalent to the 'openstack
network set --no-tag --tag <tag> [--tag <tag> ...]' command. '--no-tag'
will unset all tags while '--tag <tag>' will set a new tag and can be
specified multiple times.

The 'nova hypervisor-uptime' command is equivalent to the 'openstack
hypervisor show' command. Before compute microversion 2.88, the nova
command was using a different API that returned an almost identical
output to 'nova hypervisor-show' except it included an 'uptime' field.
Since 2.88, this field is returned in the standard call. OSC abstracts
this detail away so the 'uptime' field is always present, removing the
need for a separate command.

The 'nova migration-list' command is implemented as 'openstack server
migration list' (simply omit the '--server' filter).

The 'nova volume-update' command is implemented as 'openstack server
volume update'.

The 'nova volume-attachments' command is actually available as
'openstack server volume list', though you can also use 'server show'.

The 'nova aggregate-cache-images' corresponds to an internal API that
only glance should be using. It doesn't need to be exposed via
openstackclient.

The Glance API allows us to filter by multiple IDs using the 'in:'
operator. Take advantage of this to speed up listing of server in larger
deployments where image counts in the hundreds (or even thousands) are
not uncommon.

Unfortunately the Nova API does not support something similar for
listing flavors. Boo.

The 'config show' command will show information about your current
configuration. When using a 'cloud.yaml' file and the 'OS_CLOUD'
environment variable, the output of this will look like so:

  $ openstack config show
  +---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
  | Field                                       | Value                            |
  +---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
  | additional_user_agent                       | [('osc-lib', '2.6.0')]           |
  | api_timeout                                 | None                             |
  | auth.auth_url                               | https://example.com:13000        |
  | auth.password                               | <redacted>                       |
  | auth.project_domain_id                      | default                          |
  | auth.project_id                             | c73b7097d07c46f78eb4b4dcfbac5ca8 |
  | auth.project_name                           | test-project                     |
  | auth.user_domain_name                       | example.com                      |
  | auth.username                               | john-doe                         |
  ...

All of the 'auth.'-prefixed values are extracted from the corresponding
entry in the 'clouds.yaml' file. You'll note that the 'auth.password'
value is not shown. Instead, it is masked and replaced with
'<redacted>'.

However, a 'clouds.yaml' file is not the only way to configure these
tools. You can also use old school environment variables. By using an
openrc file from Horizon (or the clouds2env tool [1]), we will set
various 'OS_'-prefixed environment variables. When you use the 'config
show' command with these environment variables set, we will see all of
these values appear in the output *without* an 'auth.' prefix. Scanning
down we will see the password value is not redacted.

  $ openstack config show
  +---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
  | Field                                       | Value                            |
  +---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
  | additional_user_agent                       | [('osc-lib', '2.6.0')]           |
  | api_timeout                                 | None                             |
  ...
  | password                                    | secret-password                  |
  ...

This will also happen if using tokens. This is obviously incorrect.
These should be masked also. Make it so. This involves enhancing our
fake config generation code to generate config that looks like it came
from environment variables.

A volume-backed server will have no image attribute (or rather the image
property will be set to the empty string). As such, if you want to try
rebuild you will need to specify an image [*]. Enforce this.

[*] Before microversion 2.93, this must be the same image. However, we
don't touch on that here. This will be addressed later.

This patch introduces glance_api_cron container to run all glance cron
job periodically.
In train, cache pruner doesn't run even though it's there in the cron
file generated by puppet. As the new 'glance_api_cron' container
executes the cache jobs as well, this backport has only
'glance_api_cron' container changes & db purge changes are skipped
(db purge support is not there in train).

NOTE: We are not backporting db purge changes with this change because
the support of db purge cron job is not available in stable/train.
