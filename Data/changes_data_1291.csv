This patch contains several misc. changes to queue, message, and
claim limits to reduce confusion and bring the implementation in
line with the v1 spec.

1. Removed a couple of WSGI driver config options that are
no longer needed now that we have redefined (and simplified) how
we constrain message and metadata size.

    metadata_max_length = 65536
    content_max_length = 262144

2. Renamed options to be more readable and consistent
3. Moved options to [transport] section
4. Made max messages that can be claimed its own setting, to reduce confusion
5. Removed enforcing an upper limit on the number of messages that can be
posted; this was never in the spec, and appears to be gold-plating. Now, the
only upper limit is max_message_size.
6. Removed the check on the size of a create claim request since (1) it is
not part of the API spec, and (2) sanity-checks like that are best done by
the web server, before a request even touches the app.
7. Migrated limits for storage driver interface params to static values,
since those defaults define the static contract between transport and
storage drivers.
8. Wrapped validation error messages in gettextutils._, and converted them
to use .format instead of %.

Whenever an admin would attempt to register a new shard, the shard was
admitted whether or not the shard URI actually existed, and whether or
not marconi could handle shards of that type.

This patch makes it so that a DataDriver instance is temporarily
instantiated prior to storing the shard entry. This instance uses
is_alive() to determine whether or not the shard can be reached/is
supported. This applies to both PUT/PATCH. HTTP 400 is returned if the
registration fails, as a result.

To enable this change, the ability to create a dynamic configuration
object was extracted from sharding.Catalog. Tests were written for
this new function.

The unit tests were updated accordingly, expanding the coverage of
test_shards to include the new failure cases.

Some changes needed to be made to handle new oslo.cache interface:
- cache.unset doesn't exist - now using cache.unset_many
- cache.get_cache() takes a URI, not a ConfigOpts

This driver is intended to replace the current OpenStack Block
Storage HP LeftHand (LH) StoreVirtual iSCSI Driver,
(cinder.volume.drivers.san.HpSanISCSIDriver), by moving the
existing SSH interface into the new driver to maintain backwards
compatibility, and add the new LH REST interface for new driver
features.

We have the driver broken into 3 files:
hp_lefthand_iscis.py (common interface)
hp_lefthand_cliq_proxy.py (old SSH interface)
hp_lefthand_rest_proxy.py (new REST interface)

The reason we are doing this is because the SSH interface on LH
array has connections and performance limitations. These problems
will be resolved by moving to the new LH OS REST interface. Also,
new LeftHand array capabilities will only be supported in the
REST(hplefthandclient) interface.

To support new driver capabilities (create cloned volume), the
python REST client (hplefthandclient) is required and can be
downloaded from the pypi repository:
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hplefthandclient.
This REST client requires LeftHand firmware version 11.5 or
greater.

The SSH interface will be phased out over time.

This commit adds the tempest conf file to the set of artifacts that get
copied after the tests are finished running. Previously the entirety
of the conf file was cat into the console output by devstack which is
difficult to parse. By copying it that cat tempest.conf can be removed
from devstack which will make it easier to verify the tempest conf

Neutron client expects token to be passed as token= argument, while
neutron-metadata-agent passes auth_token= instead. This effectively makes the
client to authenticate against keystone each time it's instantiated. In
neutron-metadata-agent case, it means 'each time a client sends a metadata
request.'

The issue results in high cpu utilization on keystone side when simultaneously
invoking multiple nova instances with cloud-init.

Third party GUIs may rely on notifications to track the
progress of volume creation and deletion.  In the case that
a volume is being deleted after a failed attempt to create
(the volume is listed in the database but is not actually
resident in a backing store) the path that is taken in
volume.api.delete() makes no notifications of deletion
occurring.

This patch adds a volume_utils.notify_about_volume_usage
call to the beginning and end of the delete with a
delete.start and delete.end respectively.  The notifications
serve as triggers for GUIs to refresh the state of the
volume.  This change makes the hostless delete path's
functionality more consistent with the other paths through
the delete code.

/usr/local. However, there's no such thing as /usr/etc or

adding aggregate az checking logic to guarantee
that aggregate updating and aggregate metadata
updating shouldn't be done when aggregate's hosts
belong to other az. So, when az conflict exist,
user should remove those hosts.

According to python-keystoneclient, impersonation is not a required
parameter for creating a trust. Impersonation is defaulted to 'False' if
it is not provided by the trustor. When reading the
identity-api-v3-os-trust-ext documentation, 'impresonation' is listed as
an additional required attribute. This change updates the documentation
so that 'impersonation' is not listed as a required attribute for

The 'rbd_user' option allows nova administrators to override the default user
account used for RBD operations, with one that has potentially lower
privileges.  Not all parts of the Nova code honoured the 'rbd_user' option,
which resulted in failures when attempting to use a lesser privileged user for
RBD. This fix ensures the '--id' and '--config' parameters are passed to the
RBD command line tools in all cases.

* tox.ini: The LANG, LANGUAGE and LC_ALL environment overrides were
introduced originally during the testr migration in an attempt to be
conservative about the possibility that locale settings in the
calling environment could cause consistency problems for test runs.
In actuality, this should be unnecessary and any place where it does
cause issues ought to be considered an actual bug. Also, having
these in the configuration actively causes older pip to have
problems with non-ASCII content in some package metadata files under
Python 3, so drop it now.

Currently when an instance is terminated, via the project/instances view,
a ""Terminate Instnace"" button appears in the row_action column.

This is due to a the TerminateInstance class's allowed() method always

By putting logic in this method to only allow the terminate row_action
when an instance is *not* being deleted, we prevent the double delete from
occurring via row_action.

If the dhcp-agent machine restarts when openvswitch comes up it logs the
following warning messages for all tap interfaces that do not exist:

bridge|WARN|could not open network device tap2cf7dbad-9d (No such device)

Once the dhcp-agent starts it recreates the interfaces and re-adds them to the
ovs-bridge. Unfortunately, ovs does not reinitialize the interfaces as they
are already in ovsdb and does not assign them a ofport number.

This situation corrects itself though the next time a port is added to the
ovs-bridge which is why no one has probably noticed this issue till now.

In order to correct this we should first remove interface that exist and
then readd them.

The test was making an assumption that there would be exactly one volume
transfer listed which is not the case when running without tenant
isolation. Note the test before it asserts the listed transfers are
greater than or equal to one so it works without tenant isolation.

The reason this doesn't work in the single-threaded case is probably
because another test is not cleaning up properly so there is a leak
somewhere, therefore this is a partial fix until the leak is resolved.

Bandwidth usage is only supported by some hypervisor drivers, but
the period task always runs and asks conductor for a list of
instances before it gets a NotImplementedError from the virt driver.

This change allows this to be disabled by setting bandwidth_poll_interval
to 0 which is consistent with other periodic task interval settings,
avoiding the wasted conductor call.

It also will automatically disable bandwidth polling if the driver raises
NotImplemented.

Since we call the NovaObject base class to hydrate an object, the
subclass implementation does not get a chance to run specific code

change tracking need a chance to update themselves after hydration
is complete. This breaks out the meat into a separate method which
can be easily overridden in a subclass.

up-to-date after hydration.

Currently, if a vSphere API call returns a fault it will raise a
VimFaultException with the name of the exception in
VimFaultException.fault_list. This is discouraging catching of
specific exceptions.

VimFaultException.fault_list implies that a single API call can return
multiple faults. However, this behaviour is not used anywhere in the
codebase, and it is not clear how multiple faults could ever be
returned, as the vSphere API does not work this way. This change
collapses fault_list to a single fault. If multiple faults ever were
returned they would all be logged as an error, but only the first
fault raised as an exception. However, this should not be possible.

The returned exception is a dynamically generated subclass of
VimFaultException, named after the actual vSphere fault. Classes are
retrieved by name with error_util.get_fault_class(<vsphere fault>).
e.g.

  error_util.get_fault_class('FileAlreadyExists')

The code also used VimFaultException for two types of fault which are
not directly returned by vSphere. These were FAULT_NOT_AUTHENTICATED,
and missing properties returned in a RetrieveResult. The change to
VimFaultException has required these to be refactored.
FAULT_NOT_AUTHENTICATED now becomes the existing API fault
'NotAuthenticated'. Missing properties now raise
error_utils.MissingPropertiesFault. The latter also extracts
considerably more information from the SOAP error, which is available
in the exception message.

The root cause for the issue is that the Docker rest API does not
longer deliver the container list for v1.4 api calls.
The Docker API must be upgraded to 1.7.

Docker API 1.7 is a good choice since that is the first docker version
which officially supports rhel/centos.

In addition will docker client only parse json if the response needed
(to_json()) and this method will not catch json parse exception which makes
finding th eroot cause of a problem in the future easier.

We were seeing massive amounts on instance faults from failed automatic
unrescue. It was coming from the instance not having system metadata
populated.

While the route cause is a combination of using non-object instances
that were not populated with system metadata. With an object, the system
metadata would lazyload as required, but clearly not with a pure dict.

This fix ensures the non-object instance has system_metadata, so the
extraction of the flavor from the instance, during notifications sent
during unrescue, now succeed.

After commit: beecd769af02ba5915be827d28a7b46d970e41b0
we're experiencing a race in the tempest gating tests.

It appears that there are certain cases where a detach
and a delete call can overlap causing a race in the
remove_iscsi_target method.  The result is that when
the slower method gets around to the final removal of
the persistence file it's no longer there, so we
hit an unhandled exception.

This patch does two things:
1. It adds the volume lock to the detach_volume
method in the manager (already in place for delete).
This should mitigate the race and allow us to avoid it.

2. In the iscsi_remove_target method check if the
persist file has already been removed when we get
to the last check.  The fact is that if it was somehow
removed before we got here we don't really care, we're
just going to delete it anyway.

Addresses: bug #1277041
Implements: blueprint centos-rhel-for-ops-database

By default mysql binds to 127.0.0.1. Setting the bind_ip attribute to
something else, as we do in the ops-database cookbook before calling the
mysql::server recipe, causes the my.cnf to be populated with the correct IP.

However, because of this bug in the upstream mysql cookbook:
https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-4161
mysql does not get restarted (it only gets reloaded)
and so the new bind_ip does not take effect.

This commit adds a workaround until the upstream bug is fixed. The
workaround directly modifies the template resource from the resource
collection to add a 'restart mysql' notification.

** This particular patchset builds on the last by adding support for
rhel/centos which use a different name for the my.cnf template resource **

In _setup_ext_routes(...) and _setup_extensions(...)[0], there are three
logs telling that I'm setuping extensions routes, and these are done,
those failed. At line3 in [0], every resource woulld be logged before
the line 6-7 skip (conintue in Python). So here should be that I'm
'extending' resource, not 'extended'. Similiar in line 38 and line 43,
these two should be what is done and what is failed.

So this patch fix the first log from 'Extended' to 'Entending', and in
third log, 'extending' to 'extended' instend which makes context log
more reasonable.

All database API's currently include deleted images in the calc of
storage usage. This is not an issue when deleted images don't have
locations. However, there are cases where a deleted image has deleted
locations as well and that causes the current algorithm to count those
locations as if they were allocating space.

Besides this bug, it makes sense to not load deleted / killed /
pending_delete images from the database if we're actually not
considering them as valid images.

The patch also filters out deleted locations.

NOTE: In the case of locations, it was not possible to add a test for
the deleted locations because it requires some changes that are not
worth in this patch. In order to mark a location as deleted, it's
necessary to go through the API and use a PATCH operation. Since this is
a database test, it doesn't make much sense to add API calls to it.
Calling the image_destroy function with an empty location list will
remove all the locations which won't help testing that specific case.

I'll work on a better solution for that in a follow-up patch.

    The patch now excludes deleted images from the count, this fixes a
    bug but changes the existing behaviour.

    The patch excludes images in pending_delete from the count, although
    the space hasn't be freed yet. This may cause the quota to be
    exceeded without raising an error until the image is finally deleted
    from the store.

When deleting a stack, it's possible for deleting the trust to fail,
for example if the user deleting the stack is not the user who created
it, or an admin (which raises a Forbidden error), or due to some
other transient error e.g connection to keystone interrupted.

Currently in this case, we fail to mark the stack deleted in the DB
and leave the status ""DELETE, COMPLETE"", which is misleading.

Currently updates to security group rules or membership
are handled by immediately triggering a call to refresh_firewall.
This call is quite expensive, and it is often executed with a
very high frequency.

With this patch, the notification handler simply adds devices for
which the firewall should be refreshed to a set, which will then
be processed in another routine. The latter is supposed to
be called in the main agent loop.

This patch for 'provider updates' simply sets a flag for refreshing
the firewall for all devices.

In order to avoid breaking other agents leveraging the security
group RPC mixin, the reactive behaviour is still available, and is
still the default way of handling security group updates.

Instead of storing the binding:vif_type and binding:capabilities port
attribute values in the DB, ML2 obtains them from the bound
MechanismDriver each time they are needed by calling a new
extend_bound_port() method.

This is a work-in-progress patch that generalizes the ML2 changes made
in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/21946/, which replaces
binding:capabilities with a new binding:vif_security attribute. A DB
migration needs to be added before this patch could be merged.

The approach to binding-specific port attribute handling proposed in
this patch was initially intended to allow MechanismDrivers to add any
needed parameters to the port. This would be used for
binding:vif_security, and also for additional attributes such as may
be needed for PCI-passthru support being developed. Please consider
the following questions in reviewing this patch:

1) Is the ability for MechanismDrivers to extend ports with arbitrary
attributes needed? Alternatively, a single dictionary attribute,
similar to the proposed binding:vif_securiy attribute, but with a more
general name such as binding:vif_details, may be all that's needed to
carry arbitrary information from the bound MechanismDriver to the VIF
driver.

2) Does this patch achieve the goal of allowing MechanismDrivers to
extend ports with arbitrary attributes? If all ports need to have the
same set of attributes, regardless of their binding state, then it
seems the plugin would need to know about these attributes and supply
default (i.e. None) values when ports are unbound or when the bound
MechanismDriver doesn't supply every attribute.

3) Is the overhead of calling into the bound MechanismDriver for all
operations including get_port and get_ports justified, or is ""caching""
the attribute values in the DB, as in the current code, more
efficient?

4) Are there any other reasons to prefer either this proposed approach
or the current approach?

The expected use case for floating_ip_bulk_destroy is to destroy
auto_assigned floating IPs, for which no quota is used so no quota
needs to be recovered.  But it can also be used to destroy other
(not auto_assigned) floating IPs, in which case the previously used
quota was not recovered.  This fixes the quota leak in that unusual
case.

Current patch allows us to retry db.api method call if
database connection was lost temporally.

It can be done in a such way:
 - We should use annotate all methods which are safe to retry with
   @safe_for_db_retry, if it's totally safe to retry these functions
 - And we must allow db-retry feature in config (`use_db_reconnect` option
   in a `database` group). It's will allow db-retry for all db.api
   methods.

If function suppose to be retried and it's got `db-gone-away` error,
it's will calls in a loop until it succeeds, or until maximum retries
count will be reached.
Maximum retries count and timeout between retries attempts are configurable.

We use SQLA engine.dialect.is_disconnect() function to determine
broken db connection so it's should work for all supported SQLA
backends (MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2 and SQLite supported as well).

Added wrapper for session and query methods. This wrapper catch
exceptions caused by broken db connection and re-raise it as
DBConnectionError exception.

Note, that it's safely to use db-retry feature only if all db.api
queries use single transaction.

At the moment this feature is experimental, so disabled by default.

introduced originally during the testr migration in an attempt to be

cause issues ought to be considered an actual bug. Also, having

Currently it is not possible to modify the login method used with
kombu connections via configuration files, and requires modifying
the source code to actually add a login method in the first place.
This adds a configuration option (and default) which are passed
along to the kombu connection.

RabbitMQ allows three login method strings by default, but server
side plugins allow arbitrarily named strings to be used as login
methods and as such it is not possible to provide a fixed list of
options to the user.

This new script prepares a copy of the oslo-incubator repository
to house a stand-alone oslo library by revising the history,
retaining commits for files that are part of the new library and
discarding commits for files that are not. It then uses the
new oslo-cookiecutter library to inject any missing structural
files so the packaging and tests will work.

The Python documentation states that ""the type of [the first argument of
subprocess.communicate()] must be bytes or, if universal_newlines was True, a
string""[1]. Currently, in Python 3, a text string is given to
subprocess.communicate(), even though the process was created with
universal_newlines=False (the default value).

Rather than converting strings to bytes (and the other way around) everywhere
in the code, just create the process with universal_newlines=True. The side
effect is that '\n', '\r\n' and '\r' will be recognized as ending lines[2],
which should not be an issue.

The action_event_finish interface update an event solely based on action

re-scheduling case multiple events with the same event name of
'schedule' could be generated under the same action id.

This change switchs to use action_event_update interface to always

a subsequent 'finish' call which is not the case any more.

The time of the last task run for a given periodic task was being
stored in a class attribute, which meant all instances of a class
shared the same last run time regardless of when they were
actually run.  This may not have been a problem in actual use of
the code because I believe in practice periodic task classes
are created only once, but it broke the unit tests because
subsequent runs of a task might behave differently depending on
whether a previous test had already run a task.

To me, this behavior is unintuitive and wrong so it should be
changed.

This commit also fixes the test cases to properly verify whether
the number of task runs expected actually happened.  The improper
call validation was the only reason these tests passed before.

The quota API extension expects `get_project_quotas` and `get_user_quotas` to

SQLite doesn't provide a native implementation of BOOLEAN data type.
SQLAlchemy emulates BOOLEAN data type for SQLite using INT column +
CHECK constraint.
We have a few migrations changing the type of column 'deleted' from
BOOLEAN to INT. Due to limitations of ALTER in SQLite, in order to do
that, we omit the original 'deleted' column as well as the corresponding
CHECK constraint when recreating the table. Omitting of the constraint
is more tricky. It's implemented by analyzing the SQL text used for its
rendering. SQLAlchemy versions 0.8.3+ slightly changed the way
constraints are rendered, so we have to update our migrations changing
the type of 'deleted' column to work with SQLAlchemy 0.8.3+ on SQLite
backend (we aren't using SQLite in production, but we still need it for
running of unit tests).

Change in the latest version of boto is making a HEAD http request

added HEAD response in nova test s3 server and this patch addresses
the same.

Tests:
test_unknown_bucket in test_objectstore will make the get_bucket

    1. HEAD will be used by boto >= 2.25

In current implement, Nova accesses to Glance API server randomly.

The change of This patch is as follow:
 -adding option ""glance_api_servers_secondary""
 -firstly, accessing to Glance API server randomly according
  to option ""glance_api_servers""
 -secondly, accessing to Glance API server randomly according
  to option ""glance_api_servers_secondary""

The benefits will be the followings:
 - Nova can preferentially access to Glance API Servers which is
   more ""near"" in a viewpoint of network.

Consider following event sequence, ""run_instance"" on host1 failed to
spin up an instance due to port allocation failure in neutron. The
request casted back to scheduler to pick next available host. It failed
again on host2 for the same reason of port allocation error. After
maximum 3 to retry, instance is set in ""ERROR"" state with a NoValidHost
exception.

And this ""NoValidHost"" error masked out all the error messages happens
on each of the 3 host, even those 3 failed attempts have already in
instance faults table. This is because:

* By design, nova show <instance_id> only present topmost instance
  fault, if any. It provides a snapshot view of instance fault instead
  of fault logs. So the previous instance fault logs are masked out.
* There's no API to retrieve instance fault logs by instance uuid.

Since instance fault table is going to be dprecated in future,
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/remove-instance-fault-table

This change is trying to mitigate the issue by saving exception
generated events to instance events table, before rescheduling to others
hosts. So that later to be retrived using ""nova instance-action
<instance_id> <req_id>"" command.

Defaults for configuration values can be specified in the Config Opts.
This patch specifies a default for workers in the Opt instead of
hardcoding a default deep in the code.

This also fixes the duplication for the default values of *_listen
and *_listen_port which were specified at both the Opt and while
reading the config using getattr. The right place as noted above is
the Opt configuration.

Another (good) effect this has is that trying to read non-existent
*_listen, *_listen_port and *_workers configuration will fail. Earlier,
tests in test_service.py were passing even when test_service_workers
was not specified.
