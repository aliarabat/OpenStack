Previously, when security group was updated for given port, the firewall
removed all flows related to the port and added new rules. That
introduced a time window where there were no rules for the port.

This patch adds a new mechanism using cookie that can be described in
three states:

1) Create new openflow rules with non-default cookie that is considered
an updated cookie. All newly generated flows will be added with the next
cookie and all existing rules with default cookie are rewritten with the
default cookie.
2) Delete all rules for given port with the old default cookie. This
will leave the newly added rules in place.
3) Update the newly added flows with update cookie back to the default
cookie in order to avoid such flows being cleaned on the next restart of
ovs agent, as it fetches for stale flows.

Note that due to the fact that this is a stable branch and that
the documentation configuration is vastly different to master,
this is a re-implementation rather than a backport.

of URL's as links by sphinx and to remove the use of multi-line shell

The state of a shard range can be changed at different times in
different processes, but should always make forwards progress. If one
replica of a shard range has already moved to a state that is ahead
that of another replica then the most advanced state should be
preserved irrespective of the time at which each replica reached their
current state.

The only time a shard range state needs to move 'backwards' is when a
final shard range shrinks back to a root, when the root needs to
change from sharded state to active state. This transition should only
be performed by a single 'leader' process and it is therefore
acceptable to increase the state_timestamp at that moment in time so
that the active state takes precedence over any other more advanced
state with an older timestamp.

In general, the state timestamp can be increased whenever a single
'leader' is singularly responsible for performing a state transition.

validate `allocation_requests` without checking `provider_summaries`.

This patch complements the tests by adding to the test functions
`_validate_provider_summary_resources`, a base test to check
what is in `provider_summaries`.

This change will help us build new features such as nested and
shared providers without breaking the existing behavior.

sahara-dashboard specific changes:
- sahara-dashboard uses django.urls module which is only available in
  Django 1.11 or later, so the Django min version needs to be bumped to 1.11.
  Horizon Rocky bumped the Django min version
  to >=1.11
- django-babel needs to bumped to 0.6.2 to support Django 1.11 and 2.0.
- nose-exclude needs to bumped to 0.5.0 to run all existing unit tests.

https://review.openstack.org/555402 allows us to bump lower requirements.

When generating a random string, once we had selected from the various
required pools, we continued by selecting a pool at random and then
selecting a character from that pool at random. This did not take into
account the differing sizes of the available pools, nor the fact that the
same character could appear in multiple pools, which resulted in a
non-uniform probability distribution of characters. Since users mostly make
use of this feature to generate default passwords for services they are
deploying, this would result in the generated passwords having slightly
less entropy than expected (and pathological cases were possible).

Rectify this by always selecting non-constrained characters from a single
combined pool, and by ensuring that each character appears only once in any
pool we're selecting from.

Since we also want to use this method to generate passwords for OpenStack
Users, the new implementation is in a separate module in heat.common rather
than mixed in with the resource's logic. Also, use a StringIO object to
collect the characters rather than repeatedly appending to a string.

When setting the VM disk boot order, we're passing Msvm_DiskDrive
WMI object paths in case of passthrough disks and the actual image
file paths in case of vhd/x images.

In order to determine the disk type, os-win checks if the path is
an existing file path (using os.path.exist), which is extremely
inefficient. The call can take up to a minute in case of a
passthrough disk.

This patch updates the logic so that we're checking if the provided
path resembles a Msvm_DiskDrive WMI object path. The
'_is_drive_physical' method is removed due to its limited scope.

Currently there is no fallback in case when Zaqar message does not
arrive to inform about the status of ongoing Mistral workflow.

This change introduces mechanism to make execution of workflows more
robust in TripleO UI:

Workflows should be triggered using startWorkflow action - startWorkflow
starts polling for workflow execution after a timeout expires and polls
until workflow execution is finished. Then it executes a callback (usually
action dispatch)

In case a relevant Zaqar message arrives, handleMessage action is triggered
which cancels the timeout, fetches the execution and passes it to callback.

Benefits:
* Application always gets to the result of a workflow execution, regardless
  whether the Zaqar message arrives or not
* Application does not depend on Zaqar message containing relevant data.
  Message is only required to deliver the execution ID, which is then used
  to fetch execution separately
* All executions are tracked in application state

When spawning an Hyper-V instance with NICs having the vif_type ""hyperv"",
neutron will fail to bind the port to the Hyper-V host if the neutron
server doesn't have the ""hyperv"" mechanism driver installed and configured,
resulting in a PortBindingFailed exception on the nova-compute side.

When this exception is encountered, the logs will say to check the
neutron-server logs, but the problem and its solution are not obvious
or clear, resulting in plenty of questions / reports, all having the
same solution: is there an L2 agent on the host alive and reporting to
neutron, and if neutron Hyper-V agent is used, make sure to install
networking-hyperv and configure neutron-server to use the ""hyperv""
mechanism_driver.

keystoneauth/openstacksdk already basically support what the spec calls
for (other than a list of default microversions) However, they use
different option names than what here.

Although the examples are examples, it's quite likley people
implementing things will follow the naming.

Because of version discovery, the words ""api_version"", ""min_version"" and
""max_version"" all carry meaning referring to finding major versions.
(For instance, shade supports v2 and v3 of cinder, and so creates the
keystoneauth1.adapter.Adapter instance with min_version=2, max_version=3
and keystoneauth gets the latest available major version endpoint)

So that things aren't confusing, the parameter names ""microversion"" and
""default_microversion"" were chosen. microversion is given on a per-call
basis. default_microversion is given to a constructor.

Update the examples to use terms that match keystoneauth/openstacksdk.

Note that due to the fact that this is a stable branch and that
the documentation configuration is vastly different to master,
this is a re-implementation rather than a backport.

Some formatting adjustments have made to prevent the interpretation
of URL's as links by sphinx and to remove the use of multi-line shell

The requirements.txt contents do not need to be
installed on to the host. The majority of the
requirements are for ansible, or for release
and management tooling which needs to use the
Ansible runtime venv.

Rather than forcing the installation of pip on
the host, we only install virtualenv via distro
packages (where possible). With virtualenv in
place we can create the runtime venv and install
pip, etc and all requirements into there.

Doing this keeps the system python libraries as
clean as possible, preventing clashes with other
packages (eg: ceph) which try to install other
python libraries which conflict on CentOS.

Currently there is no validation of node scheduling fields - resource
class and traits - in the scenario tests. This change adds validation of
these fields to the bare metal basic ops test.

We query the flavor used to boot the instance, and extract all requested
resources and traits from extra_specs. These are matched against the
resource class and traits set on the bare metal node that was scheduled.

This information can be used on the client side to distinguish what
caused an error in the event of the same HTTP response code.

This is a re-proposal of a spec originally proposed to Queens. The main
changes are:

* It removes the requirement to implement the help link, suggesting
  we do that later.
* It adjusts the emphasis to being development of a framework rather
  than a complete overhaul of existing responses.
* Add links to:
    * a WIP of how to do it
    * placement api-ref
* Makes some comments in the Alternatives section about how we may
  wish to address microversions.

Before this change, two options that were identical except for the
location in the code where the Opt class was instantiated or how they
were initialized (the default, set_override, etc.) would compare as
not being equal. The result is that consumers of oslo.config that
include multiple definitions of the same option but in different files
would report an error for a duplicate option. The error may also be
triggered by using set_override() and re-registering an option under
some circumstances.

does not factor into the equality check for the option.

Combined backport of:
- https://review.openstack.org/557720
- https://review.openstack.org/558524

Given that tempest is in upper-constraints and its releases
are published to pip, we don't need to use developer mode
for our tests. Also, given that we're not really in a position
to closely track every move the QA team makes, perhaps it
makes better sense for us to just used the released versions
for our tests so that we only have to deal with those changes
whenever they release, implying the confidence that they have
completed their implementation changes.

This driver is Port monitoring drivers for checking application
Status.

Until now, Tacker monitoring drivers can check network(ping) and
application(using HTTP URL).

Moreover, when VNF is rebooted by ping monitoring result, tacker
recreates all of the same VNFs.

In this situation, port monitoring driver helps for auto
healing of VNFC level and it is a useful when tacker check the
VNF inside status too.

Without this patch, users running the script to test changes locally
must specify both the path to the script and the path to the local

With this patch, when running in ""local"" mode the location of the

Since the initial quota record creation is using the autocommit session and

This was observed running the neutron-lbaas API tempest tests with concurrency

The keystoneauth1 get_plugin_loader method requires that a
OS_USER_DOMAIN be specified.  Our docs don't include that
detail.

This change adds the extra needed field.  There's also some
problems currently with loading the client directly as it's
currently documented, which appears to be a bug in the client
code itself.

A recent IRC conversation [1] discussed that there are generally no tests
for the placement handler code (the wsgi methods that respond to each
URI and HTTP method). This change adds a paragraph to point out that
this is mostly intentional and that when they get complex it would
be a good idea to extract a method.

Faking out requests.Response as a mock return value can be awkward,
particularly due to how a real Response responds to a boolean check
(False for status codes >=400).  Attempting to use a real Response is
also awkward when it needs to have a payload, due to indirection and
encoding.

This change set introduces a module, nova.tests.unit.fake_requests,
intended to hold fakes for things found in the requests module.  For
now, it holds FakeResponse, which provides a convenient way to create a
Response-like that can be used as a mock return value, which responds
like a real Response to most operations on it.

We swap this into various test modules that were previously using other
mechanisms to fake Response instances.

Villalovos,jlvillal,"Switch tox unit test command to use ostestr

This commit switches the tox command to use ostestr instead of calling
testr through setup.py. The primary advantage here is that it uses the
subunit-trace output filter. ostestr primarily exists as a replacement
for pretty_tox.sh bash scripts which spread like a plague through
OpenStack projects after Nova copied it from Tempest. (although
ostestr also provides some other useful features) Granted ironic-specs
wasn't using that, but this commit makes the switch to enable getting
the subunit-trace output which is generally useful.

Note that this dramatically increases output while running tests.
However, test failures are still at the bottom of the output, so it
shouldn't cause much pain, if any.

Currently, we can't abort the process of node inspection from
ironic api. When a node is not properly setup under inspection
network, admins can only wait it to fail after a specified
timeout value, or by using inspector api, or
``openstack baremetal introspection abort`` command to abort the
introspection process.

Although the inspection state will be synchronized to ironic by
periodic task, it will create a little delay of time. Node state
will be inconsistent between ironic api and inspector api before
next state synchronization. The time defaults to 60 seconds, but
may vary depends to user configuration.

This spec will support ironic handling abort from the inspect wait
state. The inspect wait state is required before this spec can
proceed, which will be addressed by [1].

DON'T MERGE THIS PATCH

This is some sample code that implements a Proof of Concept (PoC) for
[1] allowing us to decouple neutron database related imports by using
plugin binding via neutron-lib.

In this patch:
- neutron_lib.bindings.base defines a simple plugin loader and the
parent class for all binding interfaces in lib.
- neutron_lib.bindings.objects.base stubs out the public interface for
some base OVOs. These are private interface-only (not expecting them to
be backed by a plugin) classes so other OVOs can extend/use their
public defintions.
- neutron_lib.bindings.objects.qos.policy defines the QosPolicy binding
interface for OVO. This class will be backed by it's corresponding
neutron object at runtime when using binding.

I tested in a virtual env by simply exposing the neutron ovo as a plugin
[2] and then consuming the neutron-lib change in [3]. The UTs in [3]
pass in this venv test thereby proving (IMHO) this approach could work.

Inter Tenant Traffic between two different networks that belong
to two different Tenants is not possible when connected through
a shared network that are internally connected through DVR
routers.

This issue can be seen in multinode environment where there
is network isolation.

The issue is, we have two different IP for the ports that are
connecting the two routers and DVR does not expose the router
interfaces outside a compute and is blocked by ovs tunnel bridge
rules.

This patch fixes the issue by not applying the DVR specific
rules in the tunnel-bridge to the shared network ports that
are connecting the routers.

Since the initial quota record creation is using the autocommit session and
since it is creating the initial record, it will lock at the table(index)

This was observed running the neutron-lbaas API tempest tests with concurrency
greater than 1.

This patch adds the oslo DB deadlock retry wrapper to this initial record

Refactor the code that creates a volume from a downloaded glance image
to minimize the scope of the lock that prevents multiple entries in the
volume image cache. Now the lock serializes only the portion of the
code that causes the cache entry to be created. Locking is minimized
when the volume is already cached, or when the volume won't be cached.

the option in the generate_inventory task and the ansible inventory

This by default would be scheduling to all cells since all cells
would be enabled at the time of creation unless specified otherwise.

Since the list of enabled cells are stored as a global cache on the
host_manager, a reset() handler for the SIGHUP signal has also been
added in the scheduler. Hence upon every create-cell/enable-cell/
disable-cell operation the scheduler has to be signaled so that the
cache is refreshed.

When specifying tags with 'kayobe overcloud post configure --tags <tags>', the

remain empty. See https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/20360.

used in the post configure playbooks to be unique to each playbook.

Note that test_add_firewall_post_with_router_extension() is also fixed
because we need to post unassociated router IDs to the form of creating
a new firewall but the previous test sends associated router ID.
This fix is required to pass the test after mock is used.
I am not sure why the test succeeded with mox though....

Also cleans up unnecessary mocked methods.

We don't specify any regex for this job, so it runs some tests.
They only include test_network_basic_ops, which does not check that
multitenancy is in effect. We have a test for it in ironic-tempest-plugin,
but it does not run anywhere. There is a neutron test for the same,
but it's not a smoke test and it has been skipped for quite some time.

This change switches this job to the run the following tests:
* all ironic tests (that are not skipped for any reason)
* multinode tests from Nova

Unfortunately, this patch uncovers that we don't run any tests for
network attach/detach in practice. The devstack plugin has to be updated
first to support more than one port per node. A TODO is left in the playbook.

They are forgot to split out from horizon.
They already have been moved to neutron-fwaas-dashboard
in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/541055/,
so we can safely drop them from horizon.

The Nova Compute manager expects a VirtualInterfacePlugException
exception to be raised when a vif plug fails.

This particularly affects the service initialization step. If we're
raising an exception other than the above mentioned one, the exception
won't be cought, in which case the Nova Compute service will stop.

This change ensures that we're raising the expected exception if vif
plugging fails.

The Nova Compute manager expects a VirtualInterfacePlugException
exception to be raised when a vif plug fails.

This particularly affects the service initialization step. If we're
raising an exception other than the above mentioned one, the exception
won't be cought, in which case the Nova Compute service will stop.

This change ensures that we're raising the expected exception if vif
plugging fails.

cryptography may bundle openssl in the wheel and that causes symbol
conflicts if a different openssl is provided by the distribution.
As such, it's probably safer to re-build cryptography ourselves just
to be sure that the correct distro libraries are used. This has been
addressed in openstack-ansible-tests/test-vars.yaml
(https://review.openstack.org/#/c/486580/) to fix the CI tests but the
problem is also present on regular deployments so we set it in the
role's default variables as well.

Recently [1] oslo.config started pawing at stack traces and adding
source filename locations to options set in code.  This breaks pretty
handily when you've got primitives like open and os.patch.exists mocked
while you set conf options, as seen in [2].

This patch cleans up *just* the failing instances by pulling the mocks
closer to where they're actually being used, avoiding self.flags(...).

This isn't going to stop anyone from writing new tests that offend in
the same way.  The new oslo.config will, once it gets published, though
people are going to scratch their heads trying to figure out why.

See also dev ML thread [3].

1. What is the problem?

   The oslo.config support a 'mutable' parameter to Opts.
   This is only respected when the new method mutate_config_files
   is called instead of reload_config_files.so we need to enable
   mutable config in tricircle.

2. What is the solution to the problem?

   Depend on the two path in oslo.config which are
   Icec3e664f3fe72614e373b2938e8dee53cf8bc5e and
   I1e7a69de169cc85f4c09954b2f46ce2da7106d90 made the Tricircle
   have the ability to mutable config.

3. What the features to be implemented in the Tricircle to realize the solution?

   Further patches will be needed to make select config options be marked as
   mutable. This change enables support for oslo provided config options
   to be updated via SIGHUP such as log level.

The current way of doing that is wrong, as it relies on english
language to check if the package needs upgrade. That will cause
this check to fail for any other languages, that is something
we need to expect.
Instead, use yum check-upgrade call, that provides a cleaner
way to detect if a package needs upgrade.

We don't see the failure in our gates because the two preceding

are always true, so the machine_id test is never used.

In an existing environment where the container is being updated
from an old configuration to the new networkd installation, it is
very possible that default_configuration_container and
bind_configuration_container are not changed, so the machine_id
var is checked for changed state. At that point ansible fails
because the var is undefined.

This removes the systemd service templates and tasks from this role and
leverages a common systemd service role instead. This change removes a
lot of code duplication across all roles all without sacrificing features

reduce the maintenance burden on the community when sweeping changes are
needed. The exterior role is built to be OSA compatible and may be pulled
into tree should we deem it necessary.

Once the resource tracker has asked the compute driver to
update_provider_tree, it needs to flush any changes back to placement.

This change set introduces update_from_provider_tree to
SchedulerReportClient.  This method accepts the ProviderTree as modified
by ComputeDriver.update_provider_tree, compares it to what the report
client has in its cache, and flushes any changes back to the placement

As part of our workflow, we define several maintenance windows
for FFU. One of the windows will be to just apply FFU on the
controllers. After that, apply that on sets of computes.
Add the ability to pass a limit parameter on the upgrade and
deploy steps, to limit the nodes where those scripts are applied.
That feature, combined with the --tags flag of ansible, will allow
us to apply FFU on the desired nodes.

l3-agent checks the HA state of routers when a router is updated.
To ensure that the HA state is only checked on HA routers the following
check is performed: `if router.get('ha') and not is_dvr_only_agent`.
This check should ensure that the check is only performed on
DvrEdgeHaRouter and HaRouter objects.

Unfortunately, there are cases where we have DvrEdgeRouter objects
running on 'dvr_snat' agents. E.g. when deploying a loadbalancer with
neutron-lbaas in a landscape with 6 network nodes and
max_l3_agents_per_router set to 3, it may happen that the loadbalancer
is placed on a network node that does not have a DvrEdgeHaRouter running
on it. In such a case, neutron will deploy a DvrEdgeRouter object on the
network node to serve the loadbalancer, just like it would deploy a
DvrEdgeRouter on a compute node when deploying a VM.

Under such circumstances each update to the router will lead to an
AttributeError, because the DvrEdgeRouter object does not have the
ha_state attribute.

This patch circumvents the issue by doing an additional check on the
router object to ensure that it actually has the ha_state attribute.

Sometimes, an rsync process just won't die. You can send SIGKILL, but
it isn't very effective. This is sometimes seen due to attempted I/O
on a failing disk; with some disks, an rsync process won't die until
Linux finishes the current I/O operation (whether success or failure),
but the disk can't succeed and will retry forever instead of
failing. The net effect is an unkillable rsync process.

The replicator was dealing with this by sending SIGKILL to any rsync
that ran too long, then calling waitpid() in a loop[1] until the rsync
died so it could reap the child process. This worked pretty well
unless it met an unkillable rsync; in that case, one greenthread would
end up blocked for a very long time. Since the replicator's main loop
works by (a) gathering all replication jobs, (b) performing them in
parallel with some limited concurrency, then (c) waiting for all jobs
to complete, an unkillable rsync would block the entire replicator.

There was an attempt to address this by adding a lockup detector: if
the replicator failed to complete any replication cycle in N seconds
[2], all greenthreads except the main one would be terminated and the
replication cycle restarted. It works okay, but only handles total
failure. If you have 20 greenthreads working and 19 of them are
blocked on unkillable rsyncs, then as long as the 20th greenthread
manages to replicate at least one partition every N seconds, the
replicator will just keep limping along.

This commit removes the lockup detector. Instead, when a replicator
greenthread happens upon an rsync that doesn't die promptly after
receiving SIGKILL, the process handle is sent to a background
greenthread; that background greenthread simply waits for those rsync
processes to finally die and reaps them. This lets the replicator make
better progress in the presence of unkillable rsyncs.

[1] It's a call to subprocess.Popen.wait(); the looping and sleeping
happens in eventlet.

[2] The default is 1800 seconds = 30 minutes, but the value is
configurable.

It has long been *recommended* that the placement service be upgraded
before nova services, but scenarios where it isn't have never really
been explored or tested.  Following (yet another) discussion on the
topic [1] it was decided that we are best served by *requiring* that
placement be updated first.  This simplifies our test/support matrix,
and the code we write to consume placement.  It also makes the operator
experience cleaner by giving them a clear and unambiguous script to
follow.

This change set rewords the upgrade document accordingly.
