Current adjusted free virtual capacity uses free
capacity * maximum over subscription ratio, and
the free capacity will reduce after backend selection.
While executing the concurrency operation of creating

the free capacity is not right in the periodic time

Before, the metadata describing a shard container's own shard range
was stored in sysmeta. With this change that metadata is stored in the
shard ranges table in a row whose name is the path of the shard
container.

The advantages of this change are:
- it results in a more consistent approach to storing sharding
  metadata. For example, the semantics of updating a shard range record
  are different to updating sysmeta.
- it means that all info about a container's shard range can be sent
  to another container as part of a shard ranges table replication
  or in container PUT body, in the same way that all other shard ranges
  are shared. Otherwise we'd need to keep adding sysmeta and headers for
  items such as the own shard range state and deleted entries.
- the sysmeta was vulnerable to deletion if the shard container was
  deleted, although we no longer delete shard containers until they are
  retired.

Drive-by fixes:

- define a shrinking cleave as `acceptor.includes(donor)` rather than
  `not donor.includes(acceptor)`. This ensures that cleave of final
  shard to root is treated as shrinking.
- when sending acceptor to donor, do not update the acceptor stats if
  the acceptor is the root (dummy) shard range. The root's stats already
  include the donor's stats.
- don't update root with shard stats if the shard doesn't actually have
  an own shard range recorded, in case a shard container was somehow
  created without its shard range. We don't want a shard range to announce
  itself to the root as having the entire namespace!

Cruz,sombrafam,"Overprovisioning Improvements

This is part of the effort to improve Cinder's Thin provisioning
support. As some operators have been facing problems to determinte
what is the best value for the max_over_subscription_ratio, we
add in this patch a mechanism to automatically calculate this value.

The formula used for calculation is:
max_over_subscription_ratio = 20 if provisioned_capacity_gb == 0 else:
max_over_subscription_ratio = 1 + (provisioned_capacity_gb/(
                             total_capacity_gb - free_capacity_gb + 1))

Using this formula, the scheduler will allow the creation of a much
bigger number of volumes at the begginning of the pool's life, and
start to restrict the creation as the free space approaces to 0 or
the reserved limit.

Drivers now can set max_over_subscription_ratio = 'auto' and take
benefit of the change. Drivers that somehow use the
max_over_subscription_ratio inside the driver to do any kind of
calculations are incompatible with this new feature and should
get fixed in order to be able to use the feature.

Merging change Ib96f4f5078ec1c45981d051e546bf931d2885ae2 made both
`overcloud deploy` and `overcloud update stack` try to persist
user-environment.yaml. But we don't persist `user-files` directory, so
user-environment.yaml could then point to non-existing files. This
means both `overcloud deploy` and `overcloud update stack` commands
are now broken for some cases.

This patch partially reverts the previous changes. The plan
persistence logic no longer affects `overcloud deploy`, and only
focuses on `overcloud update stack`. This way we'll make sure we don't
introduce backward incompatibility to `overcloud deploy` command at
this point. Also it might be useful to have a stable `deploy` command
as a fallback in case the new `overcloud update stack` file
preservation approach misbehaves.

And persisting `user-files` directory might have a side effect of
accumulating garbage files over time (files no longer referenced from
anywhere), which is another reason to only do that in the `update`
command for now, not `deploy`. If we implement garbage collection for
user-files, we could start persisting everything for `deploy`
too. Alternatively we might also do a complete overhaul of how we
approach deployment plan on CLI to sync closer with UI.

When a zero service version is returned, it means that we have no
services running for the requested binary. In that case, we should
assume the latest version available until told otherwise. This usually
happens in first-start cases, where everything is likely to be up to
date anyway.

This change addresses an issue where the version returned had been
hard-coded to 4.11 (mitaka).

With the addition of multiattach we need to ensure that we
don't make brick calls to remove connections on detach volume
if that volume is attached to another Instance on the same
node.

This patch adds a new helper method (_should_disconnect_target)
to the virt driver that will inform the caller if the specified
volume is attached multiple times to the current host.

The general strategy for this call is to fetch a current reference
of the specified volume and then:
1. Check if that volume has >1 active attachments
2. Fetch the attachments for the volume and extract the server_uuids
   for each of the attachments.
3. Check the server_uuids against a list of all known server_uuids
   on the current host.  Increment a connection_count for each item
   found.

If the connection_count is >1 we return `False` indicating that the
volume is being used by more than one attachment on the host and
we therefore should NOT destroy the connection.

*NOTE*
This scenario is very different than the `shared_targets`
case (for which we supply a property on the Volume object).  The
`shared_targets` scenario is specifically for Volume backends that
present >1 Volumes using a single Target.  This mechanism is meant
to provide a signal to consumers that locking is required for the
creation and deletion of initiator/target sessions.

A sharding container sets a shard range to ACTIVE state as soon as it
has been cleaved so that listings can be redirected to it.  The ACTIVE
state may then be replicated to other replicas of the sharding
container.

However, when cleaving and replicating a shard broker, the shard
broker's own shard range state should not be set to ACTIVE even if the
shard range being cleaved is ACTIVE. This is to avoid a sub-shard of a
shard container updating its state to ACTIVE in the root container
before the shard informs the root that *all* of its sub-shards have
become ACTIVE.

This patch adds assertions to verify this behaviour.

Change I11746d1ea996a0f18b7c54b4c9c21df58cc4714b changed the
behavior of the API and conductor when rebuilding an instance
with a new image such that the image is run through the scheduler
filters again to see if it will work on the existing host that
the instance is running on.

As a result, conductor started passing 'scheduled_node' to the
compute which was using it for logic to tell if a claim should be
attempted. We don't need to do a claim for a rebuild since we're
on the same host.

This removes the scheduled_node logic from the claim code, as we
should only ever attempt a claim if we're evacuating, which we
can determine based on the 'recreate' parameter.

Today the base tests module imports the neutron vlantransparent
extension to mock out its LOG. However when running the UTs without
the LOG mocked, I don't see any output pertaining to vlantransparent
extension.

This patch removes the import and mock of the vlantransparent extension
in an effort to decouple sub-projects from neutron. If there's a real
need to mock this out, we'll need to find a different way to make it
happen in the future to break such dependency.

The default proxy pipeline has about 20 different entries in it, so it
is hard to understand and easy to goof up. This number is only
increasing over time as we add more middlewares, both for new
functionality and for code reorganization.

Conceptually, the proxy pipeline has 4 parts: before auth, auth, after
auth, and proxy-server. This commit adds filter factories
""standard_before_auth"" and ""standard_after_auth"" so that we can write
a typical pipeline as:

pipeline = standard_before_auth tempauth standard_after_auth proxy-server

Users needing more advanced configuration can still use the old
20-item pipeline. Existing configs will continue to work.

When a network becomes isolated and isolated_metadata_enabled=True, the DHCP
agent won't spawn the required metadata proxy instance unless the agent gets
restarted. Similarly, it won't stop them when the network is no longer
isolated.

This patch fixes it by updating the isolated metadata proxy on port_update_end
and port_delete_end methods which are invoked every time a router interface
port is added, updated or deleted.

assume the latest version available until told otherwise. This usually

During classic driver deprecation [1], the ucs hardware type was added
to the list of default enabled hardware types. This hardware type does
not exist - the Cisco UCS hardware types are cisco-ucs-managed and
cisco-ucs-standalone. This causes conductor to fail to start.

This was not caught during testing as only the ipmi ironic hardware type
is configured when testing. Now that VBMC is in use, it is no
longer necessary to use a different set of drivers for testing.

This change enables the cisco-ucs-managed hardware type by default, and
uses the default set of drivers and hardware types for testing. It also
adds configuration options for setting the enabled boot, power and
management interfaces, with default values including interfaces required
by the ilo and ucs hardware types.

It used to be the case that one would need to explicitly tell the image
builder to run load the rsyslog-base container (via the stdout
parameter). And this commit removes that, and always loads this
container.

This is with the purpose of removing swift's dependency to the host's
rsyslog instance. By using a sidecar container for swift, we no longer
will need to rely on the host's rsyslog instance to actually persist
swift's logs.

resulting in a PortBindingFailed exception on the nova-compute side.

We have an API for setting the admin password for an already created
instance and we have a metadata API for retrieving the encrypted
password. In the libvirt driver, when a request to set the admin
password is received, it is indeed set in the guest but the instance
system metadata is never updated with the encrypted password, so
attempts to retrieve the password via the metadata service API result
in an empty string returned instead of the encrypted password.

This has been broken in the libvirt driver since the set admin password
password feature was added, as far as I can tell. The xen api driver,
however, handles the same thing correctly and this adds similar logic
to the libvirt driver to fix the problem.

During classic driver deprecation [1], the ucs hardware type was added
to the list of default enabled hardware types. This hardware type does
not exist - the Cisco UCS hardware types are cisco-ucs-managed and
cisco-ucs-standalone. This causes conductor to fail to start.

This was not caught during testing as only the ipmi ironic hardware type
is configured when testing. Now that VBMC is in use, it is no
longer necessary to use a different set of drivers for testing.

This change enables the cisco-ucs-managed hardware type by default, and
uses the default set of drivers and hardware types for testing. It also
adds configuration options for setting the enabled boot, power and
management interfaces, with default values including interfaces required
by the ilo and ucs hardware types.

Deployments with OpenDaylight fail because the Docker healthcheck fails.
This is due to the fact that the URL used for querying with the
healthcheck is not available, due to a feature mismatch.  This patch
fixes the GUI feature being installed to address the issue.

Heat brings in all of the OpenStack clients and this causes delays
during the repo build. The python-monsascaclient dependencies take
5-8 minutes to build in the OpenStack gates.

This patch is absolutely horrible, but it aims to limit which clients
are installed based on what the deployer is using.

The CNI daemon should always be run in its own cgroup. That typically
can take two forms:

- Running inside a container
- Running as a systemd service

This patch changes the way the memory usage is tracked so that both
of the cgroup memberships listed above are supported.

Thanks to using cgroups for tracking the memory usage, we will finally
take into account the CNI daemon children memory usage.

An issue was discovered if we mock an already mock-ed function. This
was happening in our execute() detection code. Change it to not use a
mock and instead a function.

Fix a failing unit test. This was due to the fact that using
'autospec=True' causes assert_not_called() to not work. This is a
known bug in the mock code[1].

Add test cases to ensure it works as expected.

fixing it but we need to decide whether it makes sense to

need to depend on neutron-lbaas or octavia and it'll add new

Most of the HTTP servers default max body size to 1MB, Apache, Nginx.
That default value is ok as long as users mostly get data from server
but when something needs to be uploaded, 1MB limit is often not enough.
This is what we see with Heat and some of the large templates.
It's not uncommon that WSGI apps have 10MB+ body size limit,
so with the current Heat default value we are still in low range sizes.

Original Heat 'max_template_size' default value was 1M.
In instack-undercloud we bumped it to 2M, bug #1667697.
This change increases it to 4MB.

The default command-line option for ceilometer-upgrade is to not
skip gnocchi resource type creation. If we do not pass any extra_params
to the ceilometer::db::sync class, we should keep defaults.

This has not failed before in CI because p-o-i was passing
'--skip-metering-database' as extra_params, but now we are removing
that deprecated option in [1].

1. What is the problem?

During the deletion of a network which is mapped to several
local networks, if the local neutron server receives a network-get
request, it will bring some conflict operations. For example,
we delete local networks before deleting central network. If a
""get_network"" request comes to a local neutron server after the
local network is completely deleted in that region, if central network
is still there (assuming it takes certain time to delete all local networks),
Tricircle will also query central neutron and the deleted local network
will be recreated.

2. What is the solution to the problem?

The solution to resource deleting is covered in
specs/queens/resource deleting.rst

Instead of dealing with some decidated functions in Update/upgrade
classes for manipulating the plan and the env files,
inherit the update class from the DeployCommand class will allow the
update && upgrade to take benefit from the plan management code
and all the tips and tricks that the deploy class does for handling
the corner cases of the plan (access rights, path of user files)
Also it avoid to rewrite/duplicate some code to solve the issue where
the --templates option is ignored by the update workflow
(and upgrade for Queens btw).

Patch I0d83fd4895d4c5beaf5a84a239c1a1ed71521dee dropped the ARP=yes
option for networkd because it's not supported by old systemd releases.
This however brings back a problem where the default one sysctl
arp_notify option in the kernel may not correctly set for our use case.
Containers are created with random MAC addresses so we need to ensure
that ARP entries are populated correctly when a container is restarted.
Instead of having to implement some sort of a new workaround on the host,
it's probably better to create all containers with fixed MAC addresses from
now on.

The absolute urls here makes allows gerrit to track the submodules, but
it makes doing a submodule update harder, since it makes git try to
clone/fetch directly from gerrit instead of the git farm.

According to the gerrit docs:

  https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/user-submodules.html

we can use relative paths. In local testing, the ../.. relative path on
a copy of the repo cloned from git.openstack.org caused a submodule
update to correctly clone from git.openstack.org as well.

Most of the HTTP servers default max body size to 1MB, Apache, Nginx.
That default value is ok as long as users mostly get data from server
but when something needs to be uploaded, 1MB limit is often not enough.
This is what we see with Heat and some of the large templates.
It's not uncommon that WSGI apps have 10MB+ body size limit,
so with the current Heat default value we are still in low range sizes.

Original Heat template HeatMaxJsonBodySize default value was 1M and now
it will be 4M. There is aslo corresponding change in instack-undercloud
where we bumped 'max_template_size' to the same value.

With the addition of multiattach we need to ensure that we
don't make brick calls to remove connections on detach volume
if that volume is attached to another Instance on the same
node.

This patch adds a new helper method (_should_disconnect_target)
to the virt driver that will inform the caller if the specified
volume is attached multiple times to the current host.

The general strategy for this call is to fetch a current reference
of the specified volume and then:
1. Check if that volume has >1 active attachments
2. Fetch the attachments for the volume and extract the server_uuids
   for each of the attachments.
3. Check the server_uuids against a list of all known server_uuids
   on the current host.  Increment a connection_count for each item
   found.

If the connection_count is >1 we return `False` indicating that the
volume is being used by more than one attachment on the host and
we therefore should NOT destroy the connection.

*NOTE*
This scenario is very different than the `shared_targets`
case (for which we supply a property on the Volume object).  The
`shared_targets` scenario is specifically for Volume backends that
present >1 Volumes using a single Target.  This mechanism is meant
to provide a signal to consumers that locking is required for the
creation and deletion of initiator/target sessions.

Due to a programming error, the files dict of a template would appear to
contain no items when iterated over prior to them being stored in the
database. (Individual items could still be accessed directly by name.)
Since this is the mechanism by which dictionaries are serialised (directly
or e.g. via items()), this resulted in an empty files dict when trying to
send the data over ReST. (The same is likely true of RPC, but we don't
generally send the files dict over RPC any more.)

Since validation occurs before the template is stored, this meant that we
could not validate a remote stack over ReST.

When creating a snapshot of a volume-backed instance, we
create a snapshot of every volume BDM associated with the
instance. The default volume snapshot limit is 10, so if
you have a volume-backed instance with several volumes attached
and snapshot it a few times, you're likely to fail the
volume snapshot at some point with an OverLimit error from
Cinder. This can lead to orphaned volume snapshots in Cinder
that the user then has to cleanup.

This change makes the snapshot operation a bit more robust by
first checking the quota limit and current usage for the given
project before attempting to create any volume snapshots.

It's not fail-safe since we could still fail with racing snapshot
requests for the same project, but it's a simple improvement to
avoid this issue in the general case.

In convergence, resources have a tendency to appear and disappear in their
own time, not atomically with a change to the stack state. Therefore when
testing conditionals (i.e. looking for resources to appear/disappear) we
must be careful to take into account the states of the resources we find to
avoid race conditions.

This adds function.resolve() for output snippets.
We should resolve only that functions that are resolvable
in parse time, otherwise validation step can fail, because
functions check arguments in result() method and doesn't

The option to enable or disable static mac addresses by default has
existed for a while but we only enable this selectively. This change
makes static mac address generation on container creation the default.
This change is being done to simplify the container network setup which
is now all using systemd-networkd. While systemd-networkd does support
an ARP option which will send grat arps, it is not universally available

Per the discussion in [1], the ironic nodes added to the node cache in
the ironic virt driver may be missing the required field resource_class,
as this field is not in _NODE_FIELDS. In practice, this is typically
not an issue (possibly never), as the normal code path uses a
detailed list to sync all ironic nodes, which contain all fields
(including resource_class). However, some code paths use a single
node query with the fields limited to _NODE_FIELDS, so could result in a
node in the cache without a resource_class.

This change adds resource_class to _NODE_FIELDS.

The container interactions require a couple interactions to address the
container namespace as well as pad the pathing when transmitting a file.
This change reduces those interactions by nearly half for a single task
by storing information about a target container instead of looking it up
for every interaction.

Example file transfer:
  > Before this PR: http://paste.openstack.org/show/691341/
  > After this PR: http://paste.openstack.org/show/691338/

In the example we can see the ""Before"" runnins 20 commands to transfer
a file to a target while the ""After"" is running only 11.

Example command:
  > Before: http://paste.openstack.org/show/691343/
  > After: http://paste.openstack.org/show/691344/

In the command example we can see the ""Before"" is running 10 commands
to run a single command task while the ""After"" is running only 6.

This change will improve general ansible performance by cutting down the
number of operations needed to be completed to execute any one task.

This patch adds an exception catch to ""snapshot_volume_backed()"" of
compute/api.py that catches (at the moment) _all_ exceptions from the
underlying cinderclient. Previously, if the instance is quiesced ( frozen
filesystem ) then the exception will break execution of the function,
skipping the needed unquiesce, and leave the instance in a frozen state.

Now, the exception catch will unquiesce the instance if it was prior to
the failure.

Under certain failure scenarios it may be that although the libvirt
definition for the volume has been removed for the instance that the
associated storage lun on the compute server may not have been fully
cleaned up yet.

In case users try an other attempt to detach volume we should not stop
the process whether the device is not found in domain definition but
try to disconnect the logical device from host.

This commit makes the process to attempt a disconnect volume even if
the device is not attached to the guest.

We should set the correct DNS IP address via DHCP so containers can get
a valid entry. This fixes a problem where the DNS inherits the DNS
server from the host and the host uses the localhost IP in case it's
running a local DNS caching resolver such as dnsmasq.

etcd compaction potentially affects calls where we are specifying a
particular etcd revision, but that etcd revision is no longer available
because of etcd compaction.  In networking-calico that means watch(),
put() and delete() calls with a specific mod_revision.  In each case the
window for compaction to make itself felt is relatively small -
basically, between when networking-calico reads some data, that has a
particular revision, and when it then decides to delete or update that,
or to start watching for further changes from that revision.  But the
window still exists.

- For watch(), compaction can cause a watch() call to silently fail; but
  we timeout each watch() call after 10s anyway, so that is OK.  This is
  documented in more detail next to the watch_subtree() call in
  etcdutils.py.

- For put() and delete(), experimentation indicates that compaction does
  not affect the correctness of put/delete calls with a specified
  mod_revision: regardless of compaction, they succeed if there has not
  been another change to the key since that revision, and fail if there
  has.  So there is nothing extra that we need to do in the
  networking-calico code here.

In addition, one might worry about compaction affecting an existing
watch() - i.e. where etcd is compacted after a client has already
started watching a key range from some revision.  But in fact there is
no impact here, because:

- if the keys being watched are changed before the compaction, etcd
  reports events for those keys (as usual) before the compaction

- at the compaction, the key value isn't actually changing, so there is
  no event

- if the keys change after the compaction, etcd reports events for those
  changes as usual.

To put it another way, compaction after a watch has started does not
impact the completeness of the information that etcd is able to tell us
about the watched key range.
