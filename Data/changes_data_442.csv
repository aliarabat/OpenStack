In the integrated build, the repo build process upgrades
pip/setuptools/wheel in the venv to our preferred pinned
version, but developer mode does not.

Keystone requires the pysaml2 python library, which (from
4.6.0) due to [1] requires setuptools > 30.3.0 - but CentOS
only has 28.8.0 when it builds the venv, so the package
install fails.

In this patch we create the venv, then upgrade pip,
setuptools and wheel, then install the keystone packages.

Doing this for all roles is impractical, but it will be
necessary to unblock patches from merging into roles today.
In the future when we use the python_venv_build role we can
do all this there instead of repeating this patch across all
the roles.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

The default number of threads does not match the default
tested upstream[1], which can return errors for users when
requests begin backing up in the webserver due to a lack
of resources and the nature of the ironic API having some
synchronous requests.

Upstream ironic, as of the Rocky cycle, executed with uwsgi
which is configured for the same process count algorithm,
but enable threds. There does not appear to be an upper bound
to that setting, but accoriding to mod_wsgi documentation[3],
the default is 15 threads. The example shipped with ironic[4]
defaults to 10, which also seems to be a valid configuration.

At some point between changes to the doc builds in the
gates and local doc builds, warnings were no longer being
treated as errors. In that time, multiple changes have occured
with sphinx and related tooling that results in errors being
generatd out of the results from autodoc, as our program model
uses classes which are inherited in various modules and that
contain docstrings.

Due to dulicate method names in the api automatic doc genration
we raise a warning. Guidence from the error is to add :noindex:
to one of the duplicates to suppress the error, however those
text entries in the index are being autogenerated, so that is
not an option.

Since there seems to be no simple path to take to remedy this,
removing the -W flag from the docs build to enable developers
to simply execute `tox` to test their changes

This patch contains binding driver, which intend to copy vhostuser port to
containers's directory. Here container's directory it's mounted directory.
Also this patch contains code to create proper VIF in case when neutron ovs
agent configured to work with vhostuser ports.

There is no code here for port creation, due to it performs in
base.connect by os_vif.plug. This function creates/or recreates OVS bridge
with netdev type, then it  creates port in this bridge. It uses vif.network.bridge
as the name for integration bridge, IOW it doesn't use ovs_bridge from kuryr.conf,
vif.network.bridge is configured by neutron ovs agent.

VhostUser mode is defined by neutron ovs agent, it obtains from
Open vSwitch configuration:

Command to check Open vSwitch configuration

ovs-vsctl list Open_vSwitch |grep iface_types

If neutron ovs agent found dpdkvhostuserclient there, it sets vhostuser_mode
to VIFVHostUserMode.SERVER, it means DPDK application in container will be
a server, and OVS will be a client, so DPDK application will create/bind/listen
vhostuser socket by predefined path. This path is set to vhostuser_mount_point.
When dpdkvhostuserclient is not in OVS's capability list, e.g. it's old
OVS or it was built w/o dpdkvhostuserclient support, the mode will be
 VIFVHostUserMode.CLIENT. In this case OVS will create/bind/listen socket,
so socket file will exist, and it shoud be copied to container's mount volume.
At the moment of copying OVS server already has to listen it, otherwise
approach is not working.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

Presently IPv6 functionality is broken with OVN. When a VM
sends an IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation request for the router IP,
ovn-controller when it responds with Neighbor Adv packet doesn't
set the 'router' bit in the 'flags' field. This results in the
default route getting delted. The fix [1] tried to addressed this
issue. But that fix was not completely tested in the openstack context.
ovn-northd adds Neighbor Adv flows for router IPs both in the logical
switch pipeline and logical router pipeline. The commit [1] addressed
the issue in the logical router pipeline. It should have removed the
IPv6 Neighbor Adv flows from the logical switch pipeline. The patch [2]
has been proposed upstream to remove these flows from the logical
switch pipeline. Until that is fixed in core OVN, this patch addresses
this issue in networking-ovn itself as a temporary fix (with the intention
to backport as patch [2] may not be available for OVS 2.9).

When 'add_router_interface' is called, this patch sets the router ports
peer's Logical_Switch_Port.addresses column to it's mac address instead
of 'router'. If the Logical_Switch_Port.addresses is not set to 'router',
ovn-northd will not add the Neighbor Adv flows in the logical switch
pipeline, there by mitigating this issue.

Once the patch [2] is merged, we can revert these changes.

Horizon test setting no longer depends on nose and related stuffs.
This commit cleans up nose related dependencies.

The change was made in horizon Rocky-3,
so horizon 14.0.0.0b3 is required at least.

Also drops unnecessary Django dependencies. There is no need to
install Django explicitly as it is a horizon dependency.

The lower bound of oslo.log is added to pass requirements-check job.
The new lower bound is picked up from lower-constraints.txt.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

When HA router's interface on host is going DOWN but router
is still available on this host, L2 population
mechanism driver will now send to other hosts info to remove
fdb unicast entries to this port on host.

It will not send FLOODING_ENTRY because this port is still on
host but in standby mode and might be transformed to master
in future.

This solves issue with migration router from Legacy to HA.
In such case, port which was originally attached to legacy
router is transformed to be HA backup port before changing
its status to DOWN.
Now in such case unicast entries to this port and backup
node will be removed properly so packets to HA router will
be really send to host which is master node for router.

Tempest volume tests can be run against v2 or v3

If catalog_type is ``volumev2``, then all the volume

``volumev3`` which is default in Tempest, then all the volume

That makes below config option unusable in Tempest which used to

Fix wrong parent of job publish-openstack-tox-docs-direct.

Fix description for zuul-docs-publish.

Move common post-run playbook to parent for publish-openstack-tox-docs.

Change contributor-guide publishing to tox-docs.

Remove publish-sphinx-docs-base, it's unused. Fold it into its only
user.

Remove build-sphinx-docs from jenkins-job-builder, we switched to
tox-docs and the job passes, so no need to make it non-voting in check
only but voting in gate.

For log-classify: Use build-tox-docs instead of sphinx - the repo has no
content, so let's use the proper job directly.

We leverage the unique constraint on network table to gurantee
at most one docker network can be created for one neutron network.
In particular, this patch moves the creation of network object from
API layer to the kuryr network driver, in which the docker network
is created. This basically ensures that each call to create docker
network is after a creation of network object and pass the unique
constraint imposed by the DB layer.

In addition, this patch also adds a destroy_network implementation
in objects and DB layer. We will clean up the DB record if the
network creation failed in docker.

We would like to fully remove mox from the test tree. Even for tests
that don't use mox's validation, many of them are using the symbol
patching with self.stubs.Set. We can do the same thing with the
monkeypatch fixture instead.

This introduces self.stub_out to nova/test.py and an example of what a
stubs => stub_out change would look like.

The teardown function in the converted test was removed at the same
time, as those should no longer be used.

Part of the mox community goal for Rocky.

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

This is a combination of 3 commits:

1. Fix sphinx-docs job for stable branch

build-openstack-sphinx-docs jobs fail on stable branches due to the new
pip version 10 introduces some previously Warning as Error: in case of
calling ""pip install"" without any package name, the command fails.
tox_install.sh is called during docs job without any package passed to
pip.

Also some tests still needs networking-odl package to be installed, however
it is removed from the required-projects of networking-bgpvpn, so they
fails now. To fix this, the easiest solution is to add networking-odl
to .zuul.yaml on stable/* branch as required project.

2. Add networking-odl for periodic-stable jobs

periodic-stable jobs fail: networking-odl is required for jobs on queens
and older stable branches. From rocky, there is no tox_install.sh any
more, so this is not needed there.

3. Fix post gate hook to accommodate for new os-testr

New os-testr uses stestr under the hood, which creates .stestr but not
.testrepository directory in the current dir. Other than that, it
doesn't seem like there is any difference in the format or names of
files generated in the directory.

Co-Authored-By: Ihar Hrachyshka <ihrachys@redhat.com>

This change also wraps up another fix (simultaneous voting test job
breakage) related to a recent change in the neutron repository of
the import statements for ml2 config.

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

The ovn_migration.yaml playbook uses the tag 'include_role'

This patch fixes it

ERROR! 'include_role' is not a valid attribute for a Play

The error appears to have been in '/home/stack/ovn_migration/
tripleo_environment/playbooks/ovn-migration.yml': line 76, column 3, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

This patch also fixes another error. When the pre migation VM is created, we
test it by running the command '/sbin/ip'. In some of the cirros images
the right path is '/bin/ip'. So change this to the comand 'date'.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

The config option sio_allow_non_padded_thick_volumes was added to
allow sites to continue to have non-padded thick volumes after it was
disabled by default due to security concerns. At the time it was only
thought to be an issue with thick volumes, but has since been determined
to also be an issue with thin.

To address the concerns with thin, the general option
sio_allow_non_padded__volumes was added, making the thick-only option
redundant. This new option was added without the deprecation of the
thick-only option to ease backporting to address the securty concern,
but we now want to work towards removing the thick option so we can just
have the one option for both provisioning types.

This patch shims the model query hook functionality to use neutron-lib.
A shim is used as the query hooks are cached in a shared dict and by
shimming them to use neutron-lib we can let consumers move over to
neutron-lib's version at will. Once all current consumers are moved
over to lib, we can remove the shim and consume from lib directly.

The DBQueryHooksFixture is also used in this patch to replace the
existing cleanup function in the unit tests.

This extends the multi_cell_list module with batching support to avoid
querying N*$limit total results when listing resources across cells.
Instead, if our total limit is over a given threshold, we should query
smaller batches in the per-cell thread until we reach the total limit
or are stopped because the sort feeder has found enough across all cells
to satisfy the requirements. In many cases, this can drop the total number
of results we load and process from N*$limit to (best case) $limit+$batch
or (usual case) $limit+(N*$batch).

Since we return a generator from our scatter-gather function, this should
mean we basically finish the scatter immediately after the first batch query
to each cell database, keeping the threads alive until they produce all the
results possible from their cell, or are terminated in the generator loop
by the master loop hitting the total_limit condition. As a result, the
checking over results that we do immediately after the scatter finishes
will no longer do anything since we start running the query code for the
first time as heapq.merge() starts hitting the generators. So, this brings
a query_wrapper() specific to the multi_cell_list code which can mimic the
timeout and error handling abilities of scatter_gather_cells, but inline
as we're processing so that we don't interrupt the merge sort for a
failure.

There is no reason to rely on comments in the files
used to bump the SHAs of upstream repositories.

Without this, a contributor can easily add a comment
and break the tooling, which relies on regexps and
well formated files to behave.

Instead, as this is a YAML file, we should rely on
a YAML parser in the release tooling, for more
robustness.

This fixes the issues by adding an extra key
(_git_track_branch) per repository, showing what to track.
This could be used in release tooling, and is not hurting
the existing code, as the extra keys are not loaded:
Those files are only consumed by the py_pkgs lookup, which
won't read this extra key.

Currently the role defines the repo, but there is no SHA pin
in the integrated repo, so the repo always builds from the
head of master. This will cause inconsistency with deployments
but, more important, will eventually fail to build due to
inconsistent requirements with the requirements repo SHA pin.

Also, due to their being no group assigned in the role, this
repo and its wheels are built regardless of whether neutron
is, which causes build failures.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

There is an increasing demand for CentOS 7 based deployments. We should
gate on it for both controller and amphora to make sure we don't
overlook possible hidden issues.

Ubuntu Bionic has not been extensively tested yet, so we make it
a non-voting check job for now.

The patch does a few things to clean up our job management:

- Refactor all jobs into project-templates in order to very
  clearly identify which jobs are voting and non-voting.
- Drop all `voting: false` stanza in jobs, the infrastructure
  team suggests that we place those in job assignment, not
  in definition.
- Set CentOS 7 job to voting for metal, as it is finally passing
  now.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

In get_records_sorted() we define a closure for convenience, which
takes a targeted cell context. That is actually named the same as
the context provided to get_records_sorted() itself and eclipses it.
That is likely to confuse someone at some point, this makes it
use the ""child context"" or ""cctx"" convention for clarity.

This is just a refactor - no test change means it works.

This makes it easier to tell which cell a result came from when
we are merging results from multiple cells. Later in this set,
we will be processing results from cells inline, instead of
waiting for all cells to complete before processing the results.
That means in order to know which cells did and did not reply,
we need to be able to determine that from each result on the
other side of heapq.merge(). Since we already have a record
wrapper class, it is trivial to stash that information there.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

httplib2 makes use of the ssl module provided by Python; under Python 2,
the ssl module does not support IP addresses as subject alternate names
(SAN's) which although an optional part of the associated RFC, is awkward
to work with in environments where certificate management approaches
rely on use of IP addresses in SAN's.

The requests module is more than happy to deal with this scenario; switch
to requests in preference of httplib2 for metadata proxy calls.

httplib2 is retained as its used elsewhere in the codebase.
