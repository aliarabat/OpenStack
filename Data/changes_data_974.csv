Each slave in a mysql replication cluster needs to have a unique
'server-id' set. This is an arbitrary integer, and often people select
1,2,3 etc. For easy deterministic uniqueness without needing to look at
what you've already used, a simple filter has been created to allow for
the hostname to be converted into an integer.

The server ID variable has been added to the my.cnf.j2 template
and the galera_server defaults/main.yml file. The generation of the
server-id variable happens within the `galera-install.yml` play making
it so there is no future impact in role requires.

delete the file and once there are translations, an updated pot file

One of the goals of this spec is to improve the image import process and
allow for other background operations to be executed when the image data
is added. This supersedes the need of the task endpoint that we'll
slowly deprecate. As part of this spec, we should make it admin only and
warn deployers that this API is going to be deprecated.

MitakaPriority
DocImpact: Tasks API is now admin only. Deployments depending on this
    API need to make sure they make it accessible for non-admins.

This commit adds a success output for the entire devstack run to the
subunit output. Ideally we wouldn't need this, but because we don't
have timing data for every single operation performed by devstack we
need to do this to track the total duration of the devstack run.

To capture failures this commit adds saving a devstack event when we
trip the exit_trap. This will save a similar result to the stream in
the successful case, but instead mark it as a failure.

This is backported from master branch to generate subunit result so
d-g can collect it from the new location.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create cinder venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""cinder_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple service restarts to
  os_cinder/tasks/cinder_install.yml so that cinder will restart
  correctly should the venv/packages update without any associated
  config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

Current patch refactors get_live_state using during
update in Resource class:

Firstly, if get_live_state raises some error, it won't
raise in update method now, just log it and skip live
state updating.

Secondly, if get_live_state returns empty dict, there's
no call of updating old resource's properties.

Thirdly, resource id checking moved from get_live_state
to update method, so there's no necessity to call super
in every override get_live_state method.

Fourthly, tests have been refactored and dupe has been
reduced.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create heat venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""heat_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple service restarts to
  os_heat/tasks/heat_install.yml so that heat will restart
  correctly should the venv/packages update without any associated
  config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

Currently, transferring a volume in a consistency group would
success. But consistency group is not designed to span multiple

This patch fixes it by adding a check in transfer API accept. It
raises InvalidVolume exception if the volume being transferred

This patch changes the keystone_ldap configuration to allow multiple
LDAP identity back-end configurations to be implemented.

Example implementation in user_variables.yml:

keystone_ldap:
  Users:
    url: ""ldap://10.10.10.10""
    user: ""root""
    password: ""secrete""
    ...
  Admins:
    url: ""ldap://20.20.20.20""
    user: ""root""
    password: ""secrete""
    ...

This will place two configuration files into /etc/keystone/domains/,
both of which will be configured to use the LDAP driver.

 - keystone.Users.conf
 - keystone.Admins.conf

Each first level key entry is a domain name. Each entry below that
are key-value pairs for the 'ldap' section in the configuration
file.

Note that the reason why only LDAP is catered for is due to the fact
that LDAP is the only supported driver in OpenStack for
Domain-specific configuration files.

Also the reason that only the identity back-end is catered for is that
the LDAP driver for the role, resource and assignment back-ends have
been deprecated and are scheduled for removal in Mitaka.

UpgradeImpact:

- keystone_ldap's first key tier is now the domain name.
  An existing keystone_ldap configuration entry can be converted by
  renaming the 'ldap' key to the domain name 'Default'.
  **Note** that the domain name entry is case-sensitive.

- keystone_ldap_identity_driver has been removed, as the driver
  for ldap is now simply 'ldap' and there are no other back-end
  options for Keystone at this time.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create ceilometer venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""ceilometer_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple service restarts to
  os_ceilometer/tasks/ceilometer_install.yml so that ceilometer will
  restart correctly should the venv/packages update without any
  associated config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

This commit removes the keystone_cache_expiration_time variable,
allowing deployers to override using standard config overrides.  The
default cache expiration is 600 seconds, and according to dolphm
bumping this up to 5400 seconds is excessive without documented
reasoning.

Note that this patch is related to [1] but does not need the temporary
disabling of the catalog caching as catalog caching was only introduced
in mitaka.

  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create aodh venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""aodh_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple service restarts to
  os_aodh/tasks/aodh_install.yml so that aodh will restart
  correctly should the venv/packages update without any associated
  config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

This introduces microversion 2.18 which signals that the {project_id}
is no longer required in URLs.

It tests this with an additional scenario in api_samples which makes
all the requests without the project_id in the url (using a different
noauth middleware to accomplish this).

Update the link fixer in the ApiSamples matching code to also update
for optional project_id. This is the least worse approach here,
because if we set request_api_version, then we have to duplicate the
entire template tree as well, which we definitely don't want to do, as
it now correctly handles either url form.

This updates the auth tests to bifurcate with testscenarios instead of
the subclass model, which makes for more consistent tests.

In order to support adding routes without project_id we have to be
able to restrict project_id something that doesn't match any of our
top level routes.

The default for this is [0-9a-f\-]+ which will match all of the
following:

 - keystone default generated project_ids [0-9a-f]{32}
 - integer project_ids (\d+) - known in use by RAX
 - uuids with dashes (no known users, but suspect there might be)

This can be overrided with the new (but already deprecated)
``project_id_regex`` config option.

NOTE: we used this feature to expand the regex to match 'fake' and
'openstack' as valid project ids in tests. Those concepts are deeply
embedded in our tests, and need to be unwound independently.

Follow new infra setup for translations, see spec
http://specs.openstack.org/openstack-infra/infra-specs/specs/translation_setup.html
for full details.

This basically renames
python-muranoclient/locale/python-muranoclient.pot to
muranoclient/locale/muranoclient.pot. For this we need to update
setup.cfg.

The domain name is already correct in muranoclient/_i18n.py.

The project has no translations currently, let's remove the outdated
pot file, the updated scripts work without them. So, we can just
delete the file and once there are translations, an updated pot file
together with translations can be imported automatically.

Stress tests use configured credential by default and
after removing the support of those depricated cred from devstack
stress experimental job started failing.

Using dynamic cred by default there.

Another issue is that stress tests do not pass domain name
in case of identity v3 API which leads to failure.
This was hidden issue as stress tests were not running with dynamic creds.

passing consistently and at least get some reliable and
regular testing of the LXC Nova capabilities.

The skipped tests pass with 3.13.0-58-generic and current
kernel HEAD, however, they do not pass with 3.13.0-76-generic
that is used for our gate testing.

DHCP Lease failure is happening intermittently in the CI and
is happening more regularly now than it used to before.

The sequence of operations is as follows under nova networks:
* n-net calls dhcp_release (we can see logs in screen-n-net.log)
* dhcp_release has a socket call to dnsmasq (you can see logs for dnsmasq
  in syslog)
* dnsmasq calls dhcpscript with add/old/del arguments

We try to fix this by making sure dnsmasq has enough time to
reload its configuration and has enough time to call nova dhcpscript
for all the existing leases. we do this by two ways:

Firstly, by adding a sleep immediately after SIGHUP, so in the same
thread if there are calls to dhcp_release they are executed after a
slight delay giving enough time to reload the configuration

Secondly, to be sure that during reload calls to nova dhcpscript
execute quickly, we have to return control back quickly to dnsmasq
The double fork trick usually used for daemon(s) is used here to
make sure that we do that and we still have code that calls the
RPC cast API asynchronously in a forked child process

assertTrue is weaker than assertEqual(True,..) because
assertEqual also compares the type.

assert for a boolean, not for something that evaluates to true.

The RPC API call describe_stack_resource is used by two separate ReST API
calls and one CFN API call: Resource.show and Resource.metadata in heat-api
and StackController.describe_stack_resource. The metadata call in
particular throws away all of the results of the describe_stack_resource
output except for the metadata itself. Either this call or the cfn one
(depending on configuration) is also used very, very often: it's the one
that every instance running os-collect-config polls for information about
software deployments (so, to a first approximation, every server in every
stack will be calling this once every 30s).

Since blueprint detailed-resource-show merged in
6d8a5cb35cec81b23a71e8c6fa692f8e7b4dca1c, every call to the RPC
describe_stack_resource API has resulted in Heat fetching the attribute
values for every single attribute in the resource from its corresponding
OpenStack API (including those calls originating from a request for just
the metadata, or from the cfn API which similarly discards the attribute
values).

This is insanely inefficient (we're making OpenStack API calls to fetch
data that we don't even return to the user). It's quite possibly a
substantial part of the reason why we've had so much difficulty scaling up
Heat to deal with large numbers of servers polling it for config. And it
tends to leave a lot of annoying warnings in the log messages, not just of
Heat but also the other services it is polling, since polling the metadata
generally happens using the heat_stack_user's credentials, not those of the
actual owner of the resource - it can't actually find the resource and
returns a 404.

The fix is to change the default ""with_attr"" value in the RPC client to
False, and only pass None (the previous default) or a list of extra
attributes to include in the specific case where the ReST API will actually
return the attribute values to the user and not just discard them. Since
the server previously treated any falsey value for the parameter (e.g.
None, False or []) as equivalent, and since nothing was previously passing
False, this change is safe to backport to stable branches. The api and
engine can be updated in any order without change in behaviour until a new
api is talking to a new server (at which point the bug is fixed).

This change also updates the ReST API unit tests to accurately reflect the
data returned from the engine.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- updates repo_build/tasks/repo_venv_build.yml to create checksum files
  of each venv tarball
- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create horizon venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""horizon_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

Assuming this logic is correct, this review can be updated so that all
similar roles can be updated accordingly.

The attempt at a move to user-name is an exercise in churn, and is
filling everyone's logs with admonitions to change the name of their
variables - which does not work if they do. Swap this, effectively
reverting the attempt at a move. user-name will continue to work on
the off chance anyone started consuming that path, which is unlikely
because none of the consuming programs expose that as an actual option.

This separates the interface parameter from the port name. The port name
is the new namevar and interface can be an array of interfaces for
bonding. The default value ensures that this is mostly backwards compatible.
The only incompatibility is if the interface parameter was explicitly
set. In this case the new port parameter has to be used instead.

The bonding configuration can be set with the bond_mode, lacp and
lacp_time parameters.

This basically renames

neutronclient/locale/neutronclient. For this we need to update
setup.cfg. The domain name is already correct in neutronclient/_i18n.py.

There's no need to keep the pot file. The updated scripts work without them.
So, we can just delete the file and once there are translations,
an updated pot file together with translations can be imported.

If live_migration_flag or block_migration_flag does not include the
VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER libvirt migration flag, then migrations will
fail with a warning like:

  Live Migration failure: Requested operation is not valid:
  direct migration is not supported by the connection driver

We should avoid invalid configurations like this, and warn users about
it.

However, there is a caveat - with the xen virt type, the reverse is
actually true. Peer-to-peer migrations are not supported in libvirt's
xen driver, so we must remove the VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER for migrations
to work with that driver.

This commit adds a success output for the entire devstack run to the
subunit output. Ideally we wouldn't need this, but because we don't
have timing data for every single operation performed by devstack we
need to do this to track the total duration of the devstack run.

To capture failures this commit adds saving a devstack event when we
trip the exit_trap. This will save a similar result to the stream in
the successful case, but instead mark it as a failure.

This is backported from master branch to generate subunit result so
d-g can collect it from the new location.

There is a race between where Xen creates the domain and starts logging
and when XAPI returns to say that the domain has started.

If the cronjob to rotate the guest logs runs in this period, it can
delete the console logs before we set the last_dom_id which is used to
preserve logs.

This change adds a fixed delay before deleting any log files, allowing
the VM start operation to return after the domain has been successfully
created.

There is a difference in how Swift and radosgw behave when a zero
length write is aborted. Swift returns 499 and doesn't create an object,
but radosgw appears to creates a zero size object. Because of this, new
behaviour which was introduced to prevent zero-size chunks being written
worked for Swift, but appears not to work for the radosgw case.

This patch changes how we detect a zero size chunk so that no request
is made to the backend. We no longer rely on the Swift specific behaviour.

Currently we have no way of conditioning an HA router's
state with a custom events.
This is needed in some scenarios that require tracking a
specific entity (i.e. pinging a host's interface) or event
(i.e. a process that is no longer running).

This patch adds the ablitiy to hook user-defined scripts
that will be executed every interval (currently 5 sec).

These script's exit code is used by keepalived to
change the VR to FAULT state (script exited with
value other then 0 - fail)

If the VR is currently in FAULT state and the script
exited with code 0 (success) then the VR will move to
BACKUP. If the VR is MASTER and the script succeeds the
VR will remain MASTER.

The script file is defined in 'l3_agent.ini' under the new
parameter 'ha_health_check_script_path'. the file
specified in that parameter value will be used by keepalived
as a 'track_script' to be ran according to the new
'ha_health_check_script_interval' parameter in
'l3_agent.ini'. This parameter has a default value of
5 seconds.

DocImpact:
Added a new parameter to 'l3_agent.ini' named
'ha_health_check_script_path' that can accept a full path
of a bash script. The script behavior should match the
details in this commit message above.
Added a new parameter to 'l3_agent.ini' named
'ha_health_check_script_interval' which will determine
the VRRP health check interval in seconds.

This spec allows the creation of service groups and objects
In a traditional networking system, the term ""service""
refers to a type of connection between two endpoints
that is visible as it passes through the networking system.
The “service” can be a layer 4 protocol number combined
with source and destination ports, all of which are visible
from the L4 payload and by deep packet inspection, can be based
on an application ID and L7 fields such as URL strings.
The customized service objects can then be grouped together
to form a service group.
The service object and service group abstractions proposed
in this spec will be first consumed by the FWaaS implementation,
but its applicability is not limited to FWaaS and can be leveraged
in other features where such service definition and grouping
is required.

This change properly configures the cache/memcache_servers configuration
for keystone. Due to an upstream keystone module bug, this setting is
not properly configured and there is no support for configuring it
within the keystone module at this time. Without this setting, the
keystone cache is enabled without properly configuring the memcache
servers which results in errors and excessive backend communications.

This enables the 'debounce' option for filter fields using ng-model,
adding a 250ms delay before the model is updated. This should greatly
improve responsiveness when filtering on large, sorted lists by
waiting until the user has stopped typing in the field before
applying the filter. On pages with complex elements (e.g. home) or
very large numbers of elements (e.g. tests), this makes filtering
cause far less browser lag, and eliminates delays before typed
characters are shown on screen.

The network interfaces we created until Liberty differed from the
install-guide in that the node network interfaces in the public network
had an IP address, whereas the install-guide listed them as unnumbered
interfaces.

For Liberty, we are making the interfaces in the public network
unnumbered, too. With this change, the management network and
our pseudo-public network (203.0.113.0/24) can no longer establish
connections with each other, because the way libvirt configures iptables
only forwards established and related connections between these networks,
but not new ones.

Our scripts are supposted to leave the host system alone, but since
libvirt already messes with the host system's iptables and the training
cluster will not work without patching up libvirt's configuration work,
this change seems justified.

The patch modifies libvirt's forwarding rule for virbr interfaces (other
than virbr0 which is used for the default netowrk) and removes the
modifications before destroying the networks so libvirt recognizes the
rule again as its own.

One downside is that this patch prevents libvirt from removing these
forwarding rules if it is called in some other context.

Intoduce the worker RAM ratio to define the total RAM every single
worker of all service types may consume. More services share the
same node, more RAM ratio should be given to the workers.
The default value assumes there are 20 different types of workers
limited by 100Mb each (or 10 types by 200Mb and so on).

(tl;dr)
Without this fix, we use hardcoded thresholds for service
workers (process/eventlet based) of 16 processes. And for rabbit -
of 100 threads. While the actual values for workers are evaluated
as only CPUs based, with the hardcoded thresholds applied.

This is a problem as the limiting global tresholds must depend on the
physical RAM as well. We don't want 16 workers for an 8CPU, 1G RAM node
to be the same as for an 8CPU & 128G RAM one. Note, that this problem
has nothing to the custom service_workers configurable per each service
in hiera. The global threshold applies only when those are not defined
as well.

The solution is to introduce the workers_ratio (configurable in hiera).
This represents the average workers-to-RAM ratio for a multi process
workers of each known type. The default value is 2000, which is like
10 generic workers of different services to consume 200M each,
or the same as 20 workers X 100M, if there are 20 distinct services.

The workers_ratio serves as an argument for a new global treshold
function limiting the maximum amount of workers for the each distinct
service type. So, there will be no more hardcoded limits of 16 / 100.
Instead, those will be evaluated as a function F(RAM, workers_ratio).
Examples:
F(1G, 2000)=1 global workers threshold for processes;
F(2G, 2000)=2;
F(8G, 2000)=5;
F(64G, 2000)=F(128G, 2000)=30

And the service_workers will be evaluated as:
$threads = min($workers_max,max(12*$physicalprocessorcount,30))
$processess = min(max($::processorcount, 2), $workers_max)
Instead as it was before:
$threads = min(100,max(12*$physicalprocessorcount,30))
$processess = min(max($::processorcount, 2), 16)

(Note that the effective threads value will be doubled for the rabbitmq
thread workers. We don't change other thread workers, like apache2, as they
are implemented to depend on the available RAM already)

Also, add missing noop tests for service workers, address todo for the
rabbitmq in the openstack::nova::controller class (no more needed as
was removed).

We have spent a lot time on getting the DB concurrency done right. So
far we are still getting reports that some actions' status are not
refreshed even after the database records are correctly updated. This is
very annoying.

This patch proposes a change to enforce 'expire_on_commit' so that
(hopefully) in-memory data will be expired to relfect the DB changes.

If two hardware managers have the same clean step, for example
'erase_devices' in the GenericHardwareManager and a custom manager,
IPA must determine which step should be kept and which should be run
in order to prevent running the step multiple times.

This patch uses the following filtering logic to decide which step
""wins"":
- Keep the step that belongs to HardwareManager with highest
  HardwareSupport (larger int) value.
- If equal support level, keep the step with the higher defined
  priority (larger int).
- If equal support level and priority, keep the step associated with
  the HardwareManager whose name comes earlier in the alphabet.

Other than individual step priority, picking which step to keep does
not actually impact the cleaning run. However, in order to make
testing easier, this change ensures deterministic, predictable
results.

The API service used to log access requests, as is customary for API
services. However, commit c4bd20ebd4b42201bf40e00d4f0a1b2c69d2e931
unintentionally changed this behavior when changing over to use
oslo_service.

This commit causes ironic-api to resume logging access requests, now
with all the additional information that oslo_service provides, by
changing the logger_name to the service name (instead of the default,
which was being filtered out).

We initially didn't implement this class as a context manager because it
was being used exclusively to lock operations that were happening in an
asycnronous thread (hence the thread_lock() context manager). However, we
now have some uses for it in the same thread (see
Ifa48b179723a2100fff548467db9e162bc669d13), so it makes sense to be able to
use the lock object itself as a context manager.

If given, apply the configuration overrides in prepare,
just before creating initial users and/or databases.
Failure to apply the given configuration should flip the
instance into a failed state.
Default implementation saves the overrides and
restarts the database service to apply the changes.
Datastores that do not require restart may potentially override
the base implementation in 'apply_overrides_on_prepare()'.

Update the MySQL manager to make use the new base methods as well.
This has two advantages:

 - It decouples the user configurations from the provisioning process
   (i.e. the user configuration is applied only after the instance is
    fully configured an running).
 - It uses the same codepath as all other datastores.

Suppose we make the MySQL password mutable. This could be quite useful
so that the password can be rotated without having to restart
OpenStack services. Mutating this involves opening a new MySQL
connection, switching all new requests to use the new connection and
closing the old one. Doing all this work just in case the password was
changed is wasteful. Therefore a mechanism to easily know what has
changed each time the config is mutated is required.

This patch briefly caches the old _mutate_ns so that it can be diffed
against the new one. _mutate_config_files will now return this
structure. As it had no return value before, this should present no
back compatibility issues, even if this chain merges across two
versions of oslo.config.

The workflow of ironic presently forces all new nodes to enter a
default initial state. From an operator perspective that is looking
to implement ironic to manage an evolving fleet of machines, it is
ideal to be able to create new nodes that are already in use, that
ironic can know about, to represent pre-existing systems, until
the operator releases the node back into the available pool.

When creating queue, zaqar will query if there is any available
pool. But for now, we're passing None for the pool group as the
query condition. That said, if all the pools have pool group,
then the result will be empty. So the patch will check if the
group is None or not to decide if the condition is applied.

There's no real benefit to returning an iterator and now we have to

I can find is in Sahara, where they listify the iterator they receive.

pointless.

re: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/mitaka-cross-project-dynamic-config-services

oslo.config already offers a reload_config_files method. This patch
provides a new mutate_config_files method which is similar but respects
a new 'mutable' flag to Opt, allowing services to mark which opts may be
reloaded. If a new value for an immutable opt is detected, a warning is
issued.

This method also returns details of which keys have changed, which
allows users to only refresh affected resources. Refreshing some
resources, EG RabbitMQ or MySQL connections, unnecessarily can have an
end-user impact.

This is the second attempt at this feature, the previous attempt had to
be reverted because it included a callback hook which it turns out we
don't want.

Being able to access CLI values as attrs is all well and good but it
muddles them up with actual attrs. This makes it hard to see, for
example, how many CLI values there are.

Rather than actually storing the CLI vars as attrs, provide
__getattr__, __setattr__ and __delattr__.

At present value-holding responsibilities are split between _Namespace
and MultiConfigParser. _Namespace holds the CLI options (as attrs)
while MultiConfigParser holds the rest. I for one find it odd that a
'parser' holds values. MultiConfigParser isn't really a parser at all
as it turns out, it just has a 'read' method bolted on that we don't
use (it is called by the networking_cisco project).

This patch takes the value-holding parts of MultiConfigParser and
duplicates them onto _Namespace so the latter no longer needs the
former. I have deprecated MultiConfigParser so as not to break
networking_cisco.

Option ""verbose"" from group ""DEFAULT"" is deprecated for removal.
Its value may be silently ignored in the future.

If this option is not set explicitly, there is no such warning.
Furthermore, the default value of verbose is true, so there is
no need to set this value in config files.

The stack_context decorator creates legacy stacks only.
This patch will allow it to create convergence as well as
legacey stacks by adding a new parameter indicating the stack
type and defaults to legacey stack. This is used by some
test cases introduced by Ifa48b179723a2100fff548467db9e162bc669d13.
