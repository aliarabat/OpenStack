These closely related features are the source of a disproportionate
number of bugs and a large amount of confusion among users. The spread
of information around multiple docs probably doesn't help matters.

Do what we've already done for the metadata service and remote consoles
and clean these docs up. There are a number of important changes:

- All documentation related to host aggregates and availability zones is
  placed in one of three documents, '/user/availability-zones',
  '/admin/aggregates' and '/admin/availability-zones'. (note that there
  is no '/user/aggregates' document since this is not user-facing)

- References to these features are updated to point to the new location

- A glossary is added. Currently this only contains definitions for host
  aggregates and availability zones

Iae904afb6cb4fcea8bb27741d774ffbe986a5fb4 added the feature to use the
original alternate hosts during re-schedule.

As in pike we don't have such feature during reschedule nova does a full
new scheduler run. However I25a4f36027390def83cfe25f4f3b4af9660da502
removed the availability zone information from the instance which causes
the re-schedule to select host from outside of the originally requested
availability zone during re-schedule.

This patch makes the az cleaning selective and makes sure that the az is
not cleaned if re-schedule is triggered.

This change updates the Ceph charts to use Ceph Nautilus images
build on Ubuntu Bionic instead of Xenial. The mirror that hosts
Ceph packages only provides Nautilus packages for Bionic at
present, so this is necessary for Nautilus deployment.

There are also several configuration and scripting changes
included to provide compatibility with Ceph Nautilus. Most of
these simply allow existing logic to execute for Nautilus
deployments, but some logical changes are required to support
Nautilus as well.

It was discussed in the Shanghai PTG.
horizon has two aspects: the one is to provide GUI to users and
the other is a library for horizon plugins.
When horizon plugins would like to use recent changes or to avoid bugs,
they need to consume beta releases of horizon.
More frequent releases of horizon would make more sense.
This commit changes the release model to cycle-with-intemediary.

After this change, horizon major version will be bumped when both
user-visible features and horizon plugin interfaces are dropped.
This menas the horizon major version can potentially be bumped
multiple times in a single development cycle.

The referenced port number under the network key is removed,
as the helm-toolkit function will return the port number under
the endpoints key.

This patch improves logging for the FC connector and simplifies a couple
of list and dict creations using generators.

The logging is around the modification that os-brick does of the
connection dictionary that Cinder sent.  It displays what the contents
were on entry and on exit, and it also warns if we are dropping some
targets because the Cinder driver returned inconsistent data.

arrange for their grpc-gateway clients (which is what the Calico DHCP
agent and Neutron driver are) to provide an Authorization token on
each HTTP request.  This change enables that:

- the installer can configure an auth username and password for the
  Calico components to use, in neutron.conf

- the code changes here use that config to obtain a token and ensure
  that that token is included on each HTTP request.

Based on [1] and seeing it's fairly common [2] configure mysql
to use max_allowed_packet=16M to avoid aborted connection issues
seen in grenade runs.

What we're seeing in bug 1844929 is that during a grenade run
upgrading to Train, mysqld is started three times (install, devstack
old side restart, devstack new side restart) and after the final
restart we start losing connections which manifest themselves during
nova scheduling with ""Timed out waiting for response from cell""
errors trying to query the nova_cell1 database.

It's not clear what might have changed in Train. To figure that out
we likely need more verbose mysqld logging enabled in a patch that
hits the failure. But for now it seems useful to try and set
max_allowed_packet to a higher size as a workaround.

During the update prepare process, if
some of the services defined in the roles

update to, an error will be retrieved during
container image downloading as the service

the roles_data adjusting, which was run in
upgrades, also in updates.

Include has some unintuitive behaviours depending on if it is running

in an effort to clarify behaviours we are moving to a new set modules:
 include_tasks, include_role, import_playbook, import_tasks.
Also this one might got deprecated so let switch to more specific

When the scheduler picks a destination host during live
migration and then the conductor task rejects the host for
some reason, like the destination hypervisor version is older
than the source, the conductor task tries to undo the allocations
created for the instance by the scheduler. This can result in
remove_provider_tree_from_instance_allocation trying to PUT
an empty ""allocations"" dict which results in a 400 response from
placement like:

Failed validating 'minProperties' in
schema['properties']['allocations']['items']['properties']['resources']:
...On instance['allocations'][0]['resources']: {}

Rather than PUT empty allocations, we should just delete them since
the instance allocation for the source compute node provider were
already moved to the migration record at the beginning of the live
migration task.

The _destroy_evacuated_instances method on compute
startup tries to cleanup guests from the hypervisor
and allocations held against that compute node resource
provider by evacuated instances, but doesn't take into
account that those evacuated instances could have been
deleted in the meantime which leads to a lazy-load
InstanceNotFound error that kills the startup of the
compute service.

This change adds a functional regression test to recreate
the bug. A subsequent change with the fix will update
the test to show the bug is fixed.

Note that assertFlavorMatchesAllocation and
_boot_and_check_allocations are redefined in the test
class because If6aa37d9b6b48791e070799ab026c816fda4441c
refactored those methods which will cause problems with
backports of this test. The redefined methods will be
removed in a follow up cleanup patch.

NOTE(mriedem): The restart_compute_service() method
needed to be added to the functional test class because
change I17f67a02b27a90658df48856963ea3fb327e81dc is not
in Pike.

Cinder and etcd are enabled by default and by default
cinder uses etcd as a distributed lock manager with

cinder operations timing out causing test failures, like
when a volume is not deleted within a given time.

This changes ETCD_USE_RAMDISK=True by default to try and
alleviate some of the pressure. An alternative is if we know

If we've reached the point of post-copy during live migration on the

something fails and we have to rollback, we need to re-activate the

for networking on the source host. When this was all originally written
I had assumed neutron would automatically activate the sold remaining
port binding when the dest host port binding was deleted, like how
neutron automatically deactivates the source host binding when the
dest host binding is activated, but apparently that is not the case,
so we have to do it ourselves on rollback.

We should be able to perform a bulk query for floating IPs

over every fixed IP for each port and query Neutron one by one.

This also limits the set of fields we get back since we only need
a couple of fields in the response.

This is probably not very useful in a tempest gate run

a server has more like 10 ports with several fixed IPs and
floating IPs.

The idea is to see how effective [1] is for performance.

TODO: needs unit tests for error cases

This adds an online data migration routine for volume BDMs when
nova-compute starts. This looks for all non-deleted volume BDMs
for instances running on the host which do not have an attachment_id
set indicating they were created before the compute API used the
Cinder 3.44 microversion to create 'new style' attachments.

Note that it wasn't until Train that we required Queens level Cinder
with the 3.44 API [1] and even before that, volumes that nova
created during boot from volume were not created with a new style
attachment [2]. The point is we could have recently attached volumes
that need to be migrated, not just pre-Queens era BDMs.

For those BDMs found, the migration routine creates a 'new style'
attachment with the host connector, from the virt driver, per
instance/BDM combination.

This allows operators to online migrate the volume attachment data
so that we can eventually remove the compatibility code for the old
volume attach flows.

During an ironic node rebalance from host1 to host2, there
can be a race where host2 detects the rebalance, adds the
ComputeNode object its ResourceTracker.compute_nodes dict
and then try to update/refresh associations for the resource
provider in placement. Between the time that host2 has
cached the ComputeNode object and refreshed associations in
placement, host1's update_available_resource periodic task
can run, detect it no longer manages the node, and consider
it orphaned and delete the compute node record from the nova
DB and the resource provider from placement. When the
resource provider is deleted via host1 in this race window,
the association refresh in host2 fails because the provider
is gone. As a result, host2 has stale entries in the RT
compute_nodes dict and possible the ProviderTree cache.

This resolves the issue by simply handling the failure
to refresh assocations and remove the RT.compute_nodes entry,
like the fix for bug 1839674, so that on the next run of
update_available_resource on host2 it will re-create the
compute node (note this depends on the fix for bug 1839560 to
""re-create"" the soft deleted compute node record) and the
resource provider.

This is pretty hairy since it involves an ironic node
re-balance across two compute services and a race but
if you trust what is written in the test, which is
basically automating the log dive from the bug report,
this works and recreates the issue. The hairy bits are
in simulating the race because in the bug report things
are happening concurrently (obviously, it's a race across
two separate services on different compute hosts) but in
the test we're doing things in serial so we have to stub
out a few things to simulate what happens at each point
in time from the view of each service.

The main takeaways are that:

1. Once the node is re-balanced to host2, we cannot
   re-create the resource provider by simply running
   the update_available_resource periodic task, i.e.
   the issue is not self-healing.

2. The resource tracker on host2 has incorrectly cached
   in memory a ComputeNode and resource provider which are
   actually deleted so the cache is stale but we're not
   healing it automatically on failure.

When DHCP agent reports to the neutron-server which ports are
ready, it was using call() method from rpc client.
That caused blocking dhcp agent's dhcp_ready_ports_loop thread which
blocks to send info about other ready ports if there are any.

Method call() should be used when RPC caller returns a value to the
caller but that's not the case here. On neutron server side this
RPC method is only calling provisioning_complete() method to
finish provisioning of ports. And is not returning anything.

So to make sending dhcp ready ports to neutron-server much faster
this patch switch to use cast() method from rpc client.
This method don't block to wait for return value from RPC caller.

This changes the nova-live-migration job from using legacy
devstack-gate setup to running with zuulv3 configuration.

Some of the setup is similar to how the nova-next zuulv3
job is done with a post-run role to execute the live migration
hook script and evacuate test script.

Since the nova-grenade-multinode and nova-live-migration jobs
both use the same live migration hooks script and the former
job is still using legacy devstack-gate setup some changes need
to be made to the script to account for the changes in how the
jobs run the script.

The complexity involved in the allocate_for_instance implementation
for Neutron means that anytime one needs to debug this code, they
basically have to re-learn what everything is and is doing, because
the variable names are either inadequate, or the methods are doing
more than their name implies, like validation methods also changing
parameters by reference. And the docstrings on several methods are
just plain wrong or missing information.

This patch attempts to clean up some of that confusion by renaming
some variables for clarity of type and purpose, adds comments and
cleans up docstrings.

When upgrading from Rocky to Stein we moved also from using the docker
container engine into Podman. To ensure that every single docker container
was removed after the upgrade a post_upgrade task was added which made
use of the tripleo-docker-rm role that removed the container. In this cycle,
from Stein to Train both the Undercloud and Overcloud work with Podman, so
there is no need to remove any docker container anymore.

This patch removes all the tripleo-docker-rm post-upgrade task and in those
services which only included a single task, the post-upgrade-tasks section
is also erased.

Stable (Stein & earlier) only - nova cells change fixed this in Train.

Nova services communicate via RPC. RPC  version selection is done after
service start. Restart of all nova services present in list
 “nova_services_require_nova_conf”
 is needed for correct RPC version selection.

Only nova services located on the same node as “nova-compute”
were restarted till now. This fix restarts nova services on all nodes.

Fix an issue that prevents graceful shutdown of controller workers.

cotyledon.Service.terminate function is by definition the graceful
termination function and doesn't have any 'graceful' optional boolean
argument (https://cotyledon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html).

Because of this error, message_listener.wait() was never called in the
consumers' termination functions, so flows could be interrupted before
completion and could leave resources such as load balancer in a
PENDING_* provisioning state.

By default cotyledon.Service terminates the server after a timeout if
the worker could not shutdown itself gracefully. The default value
for the timeout is 300 seconds (set in devstack plugin) and can be
overriden using the graceful_shutdown_timeout setting in octavia.conf
The default value will be updated to a lower value when work on
persistant taskflow will be merged.

by the 'ceph-common' package in 'install_ceph_remote'. In that change,
we made the assertion that we didn't need to ""both hiding this behind
the 'python3_enabled' function or 'USE_PYTHON3' variable since (a) these
packages can happily coexist, (b) projects should be switching to Python
3 now, and (c) using these would require sourcing additional, otherwise
unnecessary devstack libraries just to use this simple function"".
However, this didn't take into account the fact that this plugin is not
versioned. This means *any* job that uses this plugin, including things
like stable/pike, will now attempt to install the 'python3-' packages.
Since the base OS on stable/pike, Xenial (16.04), doesn't actually
provide these 'python3-' variants, the command will always fail.

Start hiding the command behind a 'use_python3' function call. Hopefully
by time we drop Python 2 support here we won't have maintained branches
using Xenial. If we do, we'll need to branch or something like that.

waits for an instance to transition *from* the provided state, while the
latter, somewhat more sanely, waits for the transition *to* the provided

We want 'ServerBase' to inherit from 'InstanceHelperMixin'. They both
have implementations of a ""wait until server is deleted"" function.  The
'ServerBase' implementation is called '_wait_for_deletion' and takes a
'server_id', while the 'InstanceHelperMixin' implementation is called
'_wait_until_deleted' and takes a full server JSON-y dict. A later
change, I0c56841d098d3e9d72db65be3143f3c893f0b6ba, will rework the
'ServersTestBase' version to bring it inline with 'InstanceHelperMixin'
version. However, 'ServerBase._delete_server' currently calls a
'_wait_for_deletion' function and passes it a 'server_id'. As such,
'_delete_server' itself is only passed a server_id. After the future
change, this 'server_id' will no longer be enough as '_delete_server'
will need to call the newly merged '_wait_until_deleted' that takes a
full server JSON-y dict, so '_delete_server' itself needs to receive a
full server JSON-y dict.

Do this work now to simplify the future patch.

We need to make sure the service has actually started before
proceeding. Otherwise, in the case of nova-compute for example, we
might go on to boot a server, only for the service to restart in the
middle of the boot process. There is no straightforward and uniform
way to wait for a service to actually be running after a restart, so
we just sleep 5 seconds. This is an ugly hack and needs to be made
more robust in the future.

Commit b11da2e changed get_server_cpu_pinning() to return an int:set
dict. Turns out, all of the tests that used it set
cpu_policy=dedicated - thus pinning each vCPU to a single pCPU - and
expected an int:int dict. This commit reverts to the old behavior.
get_pinning_as_set(), which called get_server_cpu_pinning(), is
refactored to use the raw XML, and is moved down into
NUMALiveMigrationTest, as that's the only test class that uses it.

The ability to set this is required as some test cases do not
support a duality of local boot and network boot when using
the cirros test image. This is because cirros lacks the tools
to install a grub2 boot loader.

Adds a ``[baremetal]partition_netboot`` configuration parameter
which defaults to ``True``. This allows a test executor to tell
the tests if we should expect to network boot all partition
image usage. This is ultimately required to enable ironic to
change the underlying default boot_option netboot to local.

Make upload workers processing image layers only once (as the best
effort). This also reworks and simplifies locks management for
individual tasks now managed for the PythonImageUploader class
namespace only.

When fetching source layer, cross-link it for the target
local image, whenever that source is already exists. When pushing a
layer to a target registry, do not repeat transfering the same data,
if already pushed earlier for another image.

The 1st time a layer gets uploaded/fetched for an image, that image and
its known path (local or remote) becomes a reference for future
cross-referencing by other images.

Store such information about already processed layers in global view
shared for all workers to speed-up data transfering jobs they execute.

Having that global view, uploading the 1st image in the tasks list as a
separate (and non-concurrent) job becomes redundant and now will be
executed concurently with other images.

Based on the dynamically picked multi-workers mode, provide the global
view as a graf with its MP/MT state synchronization as the following:

* use globally shared locking info also containing global layers view
  for MP-workers. With the shared global view state we can no longer
  use local locking objects individual for each task.
* if cannot use multi-process workers, like when executing it via
  Mistral by monkey patched eventlet greenthreads, choose threadinglock
  and multi-threads-safe standard dictionary in the shared class
  namespace to store the global view there
* if it can do MP, pick processlock also containing a safe from data
  races Manager().dict() as the global view shared among cooperating OS
  processes.
* use that global view in a transparent fashion, provided by a special
  classmethod proxying access to the internal state shared for workers.

Ultimately, all that optimizes:

* completion time
* re-fetching of the already processed layers
* local deduplication of layers
* the amount of outbound HTTP requests to registries
* if-layer-exists and other internal logic check executed against the
  in-memory cache firstly.

As layers locking and unlocking becomes a popular action, reduce the
noise of the debug messages it produces.

While spawning a few VMs in the same time this could lead to unnecessary

To minimize confusion, we should remove these configuration options

exists.

This helps keep our keystone configuration clean and up-to-date.

For negative tests that are asserting an argparse failure
it would be useful to assert the specific reason for the
failure in the test rather than just getting an exception,
especially to avoid false positives in the tests when what
is being tested and failing isn't the actual expected reason
for the failure.

This wraps the check_parser code that parses the args and
mocks sys.stderr so we can trap that output and put it in the
exception message that gets raised to the test.

As a result, we can tighten up a test that was passing before
for the wrong reason [1].

When the ingress pod (in routed mode, using a managed vip) moves from
one host to another, it is sometimes observed that: 1. the vip interface
is not removed on the original host, and 2. in some network topologies,
the switch fabric is unable to find the new pod.

This change updates the ingress deployment as follows:

Adds a 5s sleep before the shutdown of the ingress container in order to
allow the preStop action of the ingress-vip container to run completely.

Updates the start action of the ingress-vip-init container to check if
the vip is part of an existing connected subnet, and if so, sends a few
gratuitous ARP messages to let the switch fabric to build its ARP cache.

use None as region.

This got carried over from monasca-log-api-tempest project. The
region option was present in monasca-tempest-test project but these
classes were not updated to use this option.

Currently setting it to None causes auth-provider to default to the
first available endpoint in first region which is fairly random and
could probably be admin endpoint which might not be exposed.

Setting it to one of the ""known"" regions, enables the clients to
use the default (public) endpoint which has more possibility of
being available for tests.

This patch adds support for evacuating a server with qos ports. To do
that this patch:
* collects the port resource requests from neutron before the scheduler
  is called to select the target of the evacuation.
* calculate the request group - provider mapping after the scheduler
  selected the target host
* update the InstancePCIRequest to drive the pci_claim to allocate VFs
  from the same PF as the bandwidth is allocated from by the scheduler
* update the binding profile of the qos ports to so that the allocation
  key of the binding profile points to the RPs the port is allocated
  from.

Note that evacuate does not have reschedule loop so we don't need any
extra logic for that.

The rebuild_instance RPC passes request spec to the compute since Queens
so no RPC or service version change was needed. Therefore no upgrade
related checks were introduced.

After some changes to the FC connector we have introduced a regression
on the way we do the scans, and we end up scanning using wildcards even
though we shouldn't.

The targets in the ""initiator_target_map"" don't mean that they are all
connected, so we must take that into account.

With the current code, if we have the following connections:

HBA host7 ---- SWITCH ---- port W (channel 0, target 2)
          \--- SWITCH ---- port X (channel 0, target 3)

HBA host8 ---- SWITCH ---- port Y (channel 0, target 2)
          \--- SWITCH ---- port Z (channel 0, target 3)

We will end up with the following scans 8 scans for LUN L:

  - - L > host7
  - - L > host7
  0 2 L > host7
  0 3 L > host7

  0 2 L > host8
  0 3 L > host8
  - - L > host8
  - - L > host8

Which correspond to the responses from _get_hba_channel_scsi_target like
this:

               port Y          port Z          port W          port X
  host7 ... ['-','-',L]     ['-','-',L]     ['0','2',L]     ['0','3',L]
  host8 ... ['0','2',L]     ['0','3',L]     ['-','-',L]     ['-','-',L]

And we should only be doing 4 scans:

Most storage arrays get their target ports automatically detected by the
Linux FC initiator and sysfs gets populated with that information, but
there are some that don't.

We'll do a narrow scan using the channel, target, and LUN for the former
and a wider scan for the latter.

If all paths to a former type of array were down on the system boot the
array could look like it's of the latter type and make us bring us
unwanted volumes into the system by doing a broad scan.

To prevent this from happening Cinder drivers can use the
""enable_wildcard_scan"" key in the connection information to let us know
they don't want us to do broad scans even if no target ports are found
(because they know the cause is there's no connection).

Background:
  host = 'HostA@BackendB#PoolC'
  Host Levels are:
  - 'pool': Will search for an exact match
  - 'backend': Will search for exact match and value '#*'
  - 'host': Will search for exact match, value '@*' and value '#*'

When we want to get volume statistics for a 'host' level host,
the exist methods volume_get_all_by_host and volume_data_get_for_host
can not deal with it! The filter conditions just miss this host level.

This patch fix it by using _filter_host to get full filter conditions.
This method is compatible with previous parameter handling, so has no
negative impact.
On the basis of this, os-hosts API will work fine.

Apparently we can get DELETED event before kubelet calls CNI DEL on the
same pod. This leads to a race condition in which we delete the pod from
CNI registry before its VIF was correctly unplugged. As then
kuryr-daemon has no info about that pod's VIF, we end up with hanging,
still plugged VIF's. This seems only to affect OVS.

Commit fixes it by delaying deleting pods from the registry for to
minutes by starting a thread doing `time.sleep(120)` and then doing the
deletion.

Previously, this command would simply install the 'ceph-common' package,
which includes a number of Python dependencies. Unfortunately, these
packages are the 'python-' variants [1] and there doesn't appear to be a
'ceph-common-python3' package or similar to install the 'python3-'
variants. As a result, we need to install the 'python3-' variants
manually to ensure consumers of the plugin (like nova) can switch to
Python 3 in their tests.

We don't bother hiding this behind the 'python3_enabled' function or
'USE_PYTHON3' variable since (a) these packages can happily coexist, (b)
projects should be switching to Python 3 now, and (c) using these would
require sourcing additional, otherwise unnecessary devstack libraries
just to use this simple function.

Apparently, now days system boot chain is tempted to display
fancy things on the console. While enjoyable, in non-text mode
libvirt guest console can't make it to the log file.

This change tries to ensure pure text mode kernel console in
PXE and Redfish booting by disabling any graphics in the VM
and in guest kernel.

Note that it's not only kernel that can control display mode,
but EFI boot loader as well.

For getting on VM's text console in devstack one could use
`virsh console --devname serial1 node-0` or just add `<graphics>`
section to `virsh edit node-0` XML.

This commit introduces two patches for fixing the Monasca
tempest tests. Both are unlikely to make it into upstream
stable/ocata at this point so submitting them here:

* monasca-api/fix-metric-name-offset.patch: this one is
  specific to the unique constellation on SUSE OpenStack Cloud
  7 where Tempest is from stable/newton but Monasca is from
  Ocata and thus wrapped in a conditional. See the patch file
  itself for a detailed explanation of the issue.

* monasca-log-api/fix-tempest-region.patch: this is a backport
  of its moral equivalent in monasca-tempest-plugin:
    https://review.opendev.org/#/c/679225

Apart from that, this commit removes

  0001-Fix-InfluxDB-repository-list_dimension_values-to-sup.patch

which has been merged upstream.

If while evacuating an active or stopped server the rebuild
resource claim or group affinity policy check fails, the state
of the server has not actually changed but the vm_state is changed
to ERROR because of the _error_out_instance_on_exception context
manager.

This builds on Ie4f9177f4d54cbc7dbcf58bd107fd5f24c60d8bb by
wrapping the BuildAbortException in InstanceFaultRollback for the
claim/group policy failures so the vm_state remains unchanged.
Note that the overall instance action record will still be marked
as a failure since the BuildAbortException is re-raised and the
wrap_instance_event decorator will fail the action (this is how the
user can know the operation failed).

of the newly formed Technical Writing SIG.

The docs team has been a group of technical contributors
maintaining guidelines, tooling, and best practices for
the project teams whilst the project teams have been responsible
for producing documentation for each component since the Pike
release.

Whilst documentation is still considered imperative to an OpenStack
release, the docs team is no longer in charge of producing the
product documentation and therefore should be disbanded in favor
of a SIG to reflect their current working model in an official
capacity.

Create a PowerVMStackers SIG to replace the PowerVMStackers project
team. They are working on several repositories adding support for
PowerVM in various OpenStack projects (nova, neutron, ceilometer) but
those have not been adopted by those consuming teams yet.

A SIG would better fit the needs of those interested in better support
for PowerVM and the POWER CPU architecture on OpenStack, and put less
synchronized release constraints (and PTL election issues) on the group.

The tripleo-ssh-known-hosts ansible role used the list of network names to
create the different possible hostnames in the ssh_known_hosts file. The
network names do not match the actual network hostnames, like internal_api
vs. internalapi which results in ssh host verification to fail and e.g. live
migration to fail.

Initial approach in a5bcbc8d015b792b3546ecbb139506f248dacfe8 had to be reverted
as it resulted in errors when the _hostname inventory information was missing
from the ansible inventory.

Also syncs to use the same approach to create the hostname like in
https://review.opendev.org/693010 to have entries in /etc/hosts and
ssh_known_hosts created in the same way/source.

When building the network vif info model for an instance we already
build the list of networks for the ports associated with the server
and have the network match available for the port when calling
_get_physnet_tunneled_info from _nw_info_build_network (the detailed
call trace information is in the bug report).

This change leverages that network dict and passes it to
_get_physnet_tunneled_info to avoid redundant show_network calls
in that method.

TODOs are left in place for similar inefficiencies in the
create_resource_request method. test_rebuild_server_with_network_affinity
also shows that _get_physnet_tunneled_info gets called with network
dicts that don't come from neutron but rather built from the info
cache which are missing fields (not using dict.get() everywhere would
have made this more obvious). As a result the method has to determine

Change I74864b398f2d17a24b9ed676945183401e9872a0 in Newton
made the ImageCacheManager._list_running_instances() method do
a single query to get all BDMs for the list of instances rather
than one query per instance to avoid storming conductor.

However, when running nova-compute with shared storage on the
[DEFAULT]/instances_path config option or with a clustered
hypervisor (vCenter), the number of instances to process could
be large which can timeout the query to get BDMs (the message query
to conductor times out after 60 seconds by default because of
the rpc_response_timeout config option).

This change chunks the BDM queries to groups of 50 instances
per query to avoid overloading conductor but also complete before
the rpc_response_timeout.

We could further optimize this code to only query swap BDMs, but
that requires changes to the RPC versioned BlockDeviceMappingList
interface and cannot be backported, so that change needs to be
made separately.

While in here, the image_cache_manager_interval configuration
option help is updated to (1) fix formatting on possible values,
(2) describe the ""large number of instances"" scenarios to watch
out for, (3) add related options and (4) clarify the ""0"" default
interval value so it is not confused with the 2400 default.

This reverts commit 14872caae1a51c7015dd7c509d0173df2e943ed4.

I totally get that you have to switch at some point and it will not be
pain free ... however ...

As of right now the patch to convert devstack to Python 3 by default
is still in WIP [1].  This means basically devstack is by default
broken by this (the setup.cfg change means that pip will bail when
installing with Python 2).

This flows on to other jobs; for example consumers of install-devstack
role [2] take defaults and are thus broken too.  I'm sure there will
be other examples.

I feel like we should make sure the devstack defaults are Python 3
first, give people a little time to deal with that, and then switch
this over.
