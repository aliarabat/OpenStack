In the ML2 plugin in create_port_bulk method, we are iterating over
list of the ports to be created and do everything for all ports in
single DB transaction (which makes totally sense as this is bulk
request).
But one of the things which was done during that huge transaction was
allocation of the IP addresses for all ports. That action is prone for
race conditions and can fail often, especially when there is no many IP
addresses available in the subnet(s) for the ports.
In case of the error while allocating IP address even for one port from
the whole bulk request, whole create_port_bulk method was retried so
allocations (and everything else) for all ports was reverted and started
from scratch. That takes a lot of time so some requests may be processed
very long time, like e.g. 2-3 minutes in my tests.

To reproduce that issue I did simple script which created network with
/24 subnet and then sent 24 requests to create 10 ports in bulk in each
request. That was in totall 240 ports created in that subnet.
I measured time of the creation of all those ports in the current master
branch (without this patch) and with the patch. Results are like below:

In patch [1] there was added threads for the object change handlers and
this patch also added cleanup method which was registered to be linked
with the SIGINT, SIGTERM and run ""atexit"" to clean all object change
handler threads. But that cleanup was linked with those signals always
when neutron.plugins.ml2.ovo_rpc module was imported and that can cause
e.g. some errors in the functional tests (we saw them only in the
stable/train branch so far but maybe it can happen also in other
branches).
To avoid that, this patch links cleanup with those signals only when
object change handler threads are really started.

If waiting for a server to reach a particular status fails - for
example, a server never reaches ACTIVE after boot - the most useful
piece of information when debugging the failure is the orignal request
ID - in our example, the request ID of the original POST /servers
request.

This patch makes create_server() remember the original server boot
request ID, and wires that value up into wait_for_server_status(), so
that the latter can log it if the wait fails.

Because we have to remain compatible with calls to
wait_for_server_status() that do not pass a request_id, there's some
conditional logic to only log it if it was passed in.

Similar mechanics can, in the future, be added to other areas where
tests can fail, for example for live migration or resizing, or
attaching a port to an server.

which added a hackaround to enable our tests to pass with
fasteners>=0.15 which was upgraded recently as part of a
openstack/requirements update.

The ReaderWriterLock from fasteners (and thus lockutils) cannot work
correctly with eventlet patched code, so this adds a wrapper containing
the aforementioned hackaround along with a hacking check to do our best
to ensure that future use of ReaderWriterLock will be through the
wrapper.

Originally the sqlalchemy API method
`_dict_with_extra_specs_if_authorized` dropped extra
specs from the volume type if the request did not have

check since policy controls viewing extra_specs at the
REST API layer.

Rename the method and modify its doc string so that these
these match what the method actually does.

Volumes that are part of a group should not be allowed to be
transferred to a different project since the group (and other
volumes in that group) are bound to the source project and
can't (and shouldn't) be transferred with the volume.
The current code allows the above scenario since it only checks
for consistencygroup_id and not for group_id and the volume
becomes unusable after the transfer as any operation performed
on the volume tries to find the group which doesn't exist in
the destination project and errors out.
This patch adds a check for group_id while accepting a transfer.

It also updates the python version from py38 to py39 for

Add a new option of ``delete_wait_for_cleaning`` in the ``ironic`` section
to determine whether the state remains in the ``deleting`` state while the
underlying node is cleaning. The default of ``False`` keeps the current
behaviour of the state changing to ``deleted`` as soon as cleaning is
started.

The main consideration for setting this value is whether cleaning nodes
should count against the user's quota or not, since cleaning can take a long
time depending on the configured cleaning steps.

Setting this to ``True`` may be desirable when:

* Consistency is preferred with other slow-deleting resources such as cinder
  volumes (without the trash feature)

* The user generally wants to immediately reprovision the exact same
  baremetal node and needs to know its actual availability

* Propagate a failed clean to a nova error state, to make it obvious to the
  user that admin attention is required

Setting this to ``False`` may be desirable when:

* Users expect the existing behaviour of not losing quota while the node is
  cleaning

When ``delete_wait_for_cleaning`` is True, this change adds polling at
the end of the destroy method to wait until the ironic node either
goes to AVAILABLE or CLEANFAIL.

It turns out that eventlet has been injecting a
``Transfer-Encoding`` header as of recent into WSGI application
response headers. The result of this ultimately depends on how
the HTTP client which is passing the request to the server is
written to handle data.

Apache, for example, will return that an invalid response was
received. In part because it sees the request end, with an HTTP
204 response code, but also an encoding indicating there is
a multipart body encoding inbound. Which is confusing.

Other C based HTTP clients can have any number of reactions up to
and including disconnecting sessions. Curl, depending on the
headers present either returns success but notes body weirdness
or actually returns return code 18.

Python-Requests kind of has it a little worse, and we see this
with clients. With it, it tries to prepare a respones content
body based upon the presence of the header indicating there is
a body. But it blows up thinking there is more data to read on
the socket when there is not more data to read.

Regardless, all of this is an RFC7230 violation.

Neither Content-Length nor Transfer-Encoding should be on an HTTP
204 response. However, Content-Length is the lesser evil, and we
have a similar endpoing in Ironic which *does* explicitly get
returned with a zero length content-length, and does not
demonstrate such issues.

As such, in the interest of the lesser evils until Eventlet's evil
ways of header injection are remedied, we're explicitly going to
force a Content-Length header to be sent indicating a zero length
response.

Recent iputils in CentOS 8 Stream removed capabilities on the ping

unprivileged users to ping, however the change in systemd[1] is not

This is a temporal workaround and sets the kernel parameter. This can
be removed once the fix is shipped as part of a new systemd package.

There are some features in nova-compute which validate policy rules.
For example when connecting an instance to an external network,
nova-compute checks ``network:attach_external_network`` to determine
whether the operation is permitted.

This change migrates definition of nova::policy hieradata from nova-api
to nova-base so that the hieradata can be used by both nova-api and
nova-compute.

In order to cherry-pick fix to stable branches we fix rich version.

We can't use requirements as rich is neither in blacklist nor in
global-requirements, so must be handled independently

This should be reverted with ansible-lint version bump.

The test test_egress_np_to_service_wo_selector is failing in some

While performing nondisruptive migrations, share servers can not
change, because such thing will cause the migration to be
disruptive, since share servers have different network allocations
and it will cause the destination share to change its export
locations.
This change fixes an issue that allowed manila/the share driver
to chose where a share instance is going to land in case of a
nondisruptive migration. Now, when such migration is required,
manila will automatically place the destination share instance in
the same share server that the source instance is located at.

The nova flavor for Octavia was previously created from puppet-octavia
but it didn't offer a convenient way to select the type of the API
endpoint (it uses public API endpoint by default while some deployments
don't have access to the external network from their controllers).

Moving the creation of the flavor to a tripleo-ansible role helps us to
use the existing configuration (the roles use the internal endpoints)
and centralizes the creation of all the resources required by Octavia in
a single place.

On neutron routed provider networks IP allocation is
deferred until 'binding:host_id' is set. When ironic
creates neutron ports it first creates the port, then
updates the port setting binding information.

When using IPv6 networking ironic adds additional address
allocations to ensure network chain-booting will succeed.
When address allocation is deferred on port create ironic
cannot detect that IPv6 is used and does not add the
required additional addresses.

This change ensures the 'port' object is updated after the
port update setting the port binding required for neutron
to allocate the address. This allows ironic to correctly
detect IPv6 is used, and it will add the required IP
address allocations.

Devstack stable/wallaby and onwards has replaced the
centOS testing with centOS Stream. For older stable branches
(<= stable/victoria) we can either replace it with centOS Steam
or do the removal of CentOS8 and adding CentOS Stream testing
in two steps 1. drop the centOS8 testing as it cannot

There are some features in nova-compute which validate policy rules.
For example when connecting an instance to an external network,
nova-compute checks ``network:attach_external_network`` to determine
whether the operation is permitted.

This change makes sure that the nova policy file in compute nodes are
also managed by puppet-tripleo.

On neutron routed provider networks IP allocation is
deferred until 'binding:host_id' is set. When ironic
creates neutron ports it first creates the port, then
updates the port setting binding information.

When using IPv6 networking ironic adds additional address
allocations to ensure network chain-booting will succeed.
When address allocation is deferred on port create ironic
cannot detect that IPv6 is used and does not add the
required additional addresses.

This change ensures the 'port' object is updated after the
port update setting the port binding required for neutron
to allocate the address. This allows ironic to correctly
detect IPv6 is used, and it will add the required IP
address allocations.

The NoValidDefaultForInterface exception is a little misleading
in that if one doesn't have the base interface enabled, and they
attempt to enable a hardware type which requires or only supports
disabled interfaces, they will also get an exeption. The reality
is we need to suggest for them to look at enabling the interfaces
before looking at the default interface overrides, because logically
the brain jumps to setting a default before checking the interface
settings.

On neutron routed provider networks IP allocation is
deferred until 'binding:host_id' is set. When ironic
creates neutron ports it first creates the port, then
updates the port setting binding information.

When using IPv6 networking ironic adds additional address
allocations to ensure network chain-booting will succeed.
When address allocation is deferred on port create ironic
cannot detect that IPv6 is used and does not add the
required additional addresses.

This change ensures the 'port' object is updated after the
port update setting the port binding required for neutron
to allocate the address. This allows ironic to correctly
detect IPv6 is used, and it will add the required IP
address allocations.

On neutron routed provider networks IP allocation is
deferred until 'binding:host_id' is set. When ironic
creates neutron ports it first creates the port, then
updates the port setting binding information.

When using IPv6 networking ironic adds additional address
allocations to ensure network chain-booting will succeed.
When address allocation is deferred on port create ironic
cannot detect that IPv6 is used and does not add the
required additional addresses.

This change ensures the 'port' object is updated after the
port update setting the port binding required for neutron
to allocate the address. This allows ironic to correctly
detect IPv6 is used, and it will add the required IP
address allocations.

In the Xena release, Ironic removed the iSCSI driver [1]. The
recommended driver is direct, which uses HTTP to transfer the disk
image. This requires an HTTP server, and the simplest option is to use
the one currently deployed when enable_ironic_ipxe is set to true. For
this reason, this patch always enables the HTTP server running on the
conductor.

iPXE is still enabled separately, since it cannot currently be used at
the same time as PXE.

Backport note: Ironic made direct the default in Wallaby. This Wallaby
backport ensures that the defaults in Kolla & Ironic may work together.

On neutron routed provider networks IP allocation is
deferred until 'binding:host_id' is set. When ironic
creates neutron ports it first creates the port, then
updates the port setting binding information.

When using IPv6 networking ironic adds additional address
allocations to ensure network chain-booting will succeed.
When address allocation is deferred on port create ironic
cannot detect that IPv6 is used and does not add the
required additional addresses.

This change ensures the 'port' object is updated after the
port update setting the port binding required for neutron
to allocate the address. This allows ironic to correctly
detect IPv6 is used, and it will add the required IP
address allocations.

Nova evacuates instances only when the nova-compute is down, rather than disabled.
So if nova-compute already down, unnecessary to wait before instances evacuate.

Moreover, Nova service default heartbeat is 60 seconds, so default 60
secons at most to wait after service update is more reasonable.

This is a revert of 373a27163e0365919f707604df5b61863029d2e4 because
makestep does not fail if the ntp servers are unavailable. This change
adds waitsync back in so it fails if the servers are unavilable but
leaves the makestep in place which should force the sync.  If the
servers are unavailable, the waitsync should catch it. If they are
available waitsync should be a relative noop because the makestep would
sync the system.  The waitsync has been increased to 5 minutes (from 200
seconds). waitsync will wait 30 times with an interval of 10 seconds
between checks.

This change adds distro specific config files to etc/ironic which
captures values for loader_file_paths. By setting this value, ironic
will populate TFTP and HTTP directories with distro packaged binaries
on controller startup, meaning that deployment tools no longer need be
responsible for populating these directories.

It is proposed that maintaining these values in the ironic repository
will reduce the amount of duplication across packaging and deployment
tools. Consumers of ironic releases are expected to consume these
files in the following ways.

Packaging (RDO, debian, ubuntu, SUSE):
Use the appropriate file as its ironic-dist.conf (or merge it with any
packaged configuration)

Python packaged deployment tools (devstack, bifrost):
Choose the appropriate ironic-dist-*.conf based on detected distro,
and include that configuration when starting services.

Distro packaged deployment tools (TripleO, puppet-ironic, metal3
ironic-image, ubuntu charms):
Ensure the packaged ironic-dist.conf is included when starting ironic
services, deprecate parameters which trigger file copying.

Debian family and SUSE include grub and shim files but Red Hat family
does not because they're packaged to only allow read by root. These
can be added back if the copy operations can be done with privsep.

In the patch [1] create_netns function from the Neutron's
privileged ip_lib module was changed in the way that it was
implemented in the same way like original pyroute2's create_netns
function.
Unfortunately during backporing that patch to stable/ussuri and
stable/train branches, we probably made mistake and instead of
calling pyroute2's private function _netns() we still called
public function netns() (which we tried to ""reimplement"" really).

So this patch updates it and changes to use private _netns() function
from pyroute2, in the same way like it is done in the branches newer
than stable/ussuri.

Throw our stream of async_pendings through a hash ring; if the virtual
bucket gets hot just start leaving the updates on the floor and move on.

It's off by default; and if you use it you're probably going to leave a
bunch of async updates pointed at a small set of containers in the queue
for the next sweep every sweep (so maybe turn it off at some point)

The kickstart template expects a dictionary with 'ks_options'
as the key. Instead build_kickstart_config_options function
returns a dict with keys 'liveimg_url', 'agent_token' and
'heartbeat_url'.

This change fixes this problem by returning a dictionary of
dict with 'ks_options' as key and the dictionary with
keys 'liveimg_url', 'agent_token' and heartbeat_url' as
value.

Fix a bug where the deploy() method of anaconda deploy
interface where it did not return states.DEPLOYWAIT instead
it returned 'None' which caused the instance to go straight to
'active' instead of 'wait call-back'.

Fix issues in the default kickstart template where heartbeat was
missing 'callback_url' parameter and the HTTP method should be
'POST' not 'PUT'.

Fix issues with automated cleaning when anaconda deploy interface
is used.

Anaconda deploy interface could not deploy tarballs as
the disk image sent to the anaconda interface via liveimg --url
kickstart command does not include any file extension. When
no file extension is present the kickstart command liveimg --url
assumes the disk is a mountable partiton image. We fix this
problem by enabling the user to specify file extensions using
a glance image property named 'disk_file_extension' on the OS
image.

We have observed that omitting statefulset
on the olso_messaging values can cause octavia
workers to ocasionally fail with:

AMQP server on rabbitmq.openstack.svc.cluster.local:5672 is unreachable:
[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer. Trying again in 1 seconds.:
ConnectionResetError: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer

This patch aims to keep the pattern used on the other serivces
to setup the transport_url that includes all pods in the statefulset.

Sushy 4.0.0 has breaking changes in it which prevent usage
with this version of ironic. While the global upper requirements
is unlikely ever to attempt to increment to 4.0.0, the explicit
requirements invocation, like what is in place for running
driver unit tests, was trying to pull in 4.0.0 resulting in test
failures.

Also explicitly fix the upper constraints for tox.ini to the
xena release branch, which was from the development cycle which
resulted in this bugfix branch.

And also reduces the overall set of jobs for the bugfix branch down
to more a needful set of jobs as this branch is intended for bugfixes
to be tracked on the 18.1 release.

This patch allows to skip the installation
of the database backend packages (MySQL or Postgres)
with the introduction of the INSTALL_DATABASE_SERVER_PACKAGES
variable (defaulted to True).
This is useful in such environments that do not require
to install the MySQL/Postgres server packages directly but using
a container serving that purpose, for those cases all the
remaining steps should be executed just skipping the
packages install.

It turned out defining dependency for openstacklib::wsgi::apache

is not purged properly.
This change adds the more explicit dependency to enforce the order
