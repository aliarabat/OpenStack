Intermediary-released deliverables that did release only once during
the last cycle, and have not done a release yet are good candidates
to switch to the cycle-with-rc model, which is much more suitable for
deliverables that are only released once per cycle.

These changes are not mandatory and this patch is a conveniences to
highlight this point and open the discussion.

PTLs and release liaisons please decide to:
- immediately release an intermediary release (and -1 the proposed change)
- confirm the release model change (+1 the proposed change)
- stay uncertain for this cycle of how many releases will be made, but
  acknowledge that they need to do a release before RC1 (-1 the proposed
  change)

This change gives the Container driver the ability to create share
servers that span multiple subnets in the same availability zone, where
previously it was only possible to do so with one subnet per
availability zone. It also enables the driver to create new subnets on
share networks that already have shares exported on them.

Some relevant changes in the driver behavior:

- _get_veth_state() and _get_corresponding_veth() were removed
- container creation is now separate from its start
- containers no longer use the default Docker network; instead,
  dedicated networks are created (one for each subnet)
- fetch_container_addresses() now returns a list of addresses
- three new methods were written: _get_veth(), create_network(), and
  connect_network()

The new networkx requirement apparently causes us to fail the
test_init_copy_flow_as_non_owner test because a None value can not be
added to the flow graph. This just mocks out the glance_store call
that is failing to get the staging store to avoid us choking there
so we can proceed. We are just testing get_flow so we never use it
anyway.

SUSE dropped OpenStack Cloud in 2019 [1], and as a result, some
OpenStack-related repositories were removed from openSUSE Download and
root filesystem images stopped being provided. This change deprecates
Leap releases before 15.3 and employs the extract-image script. It also
moves the extract-image script to the sysprep element, since now it's
also used by openSUSE-related elements.

Additionally, revert the ""Remove opensuse related funtests"" change [2]
so that the opensuse element is tested again and set the default Leap
release to 15.3.

This middleware is used to enable request tracing. At this stage the is
no actual HMAC To start tracing so any value can be put into the
query_string parameter trace_sig. When you do that req will be traced.

Some raw output can be either written to file, back to swift or out to
tracing software that supports opentracing.

The middleware also introduces another option which will trace every x
request. This can be handy if you want to insert the middleware into
something like the internal client config.

The request will start tracing as the request hits this middleware and
dump the result as the request returns. As such, to get as much info as
possible it's best to have it as close to the front of the pipeline as
possible.

Most notibly however if this patch also introduces OpenTracing support,
so if you supply a tracer class you can start sending the tracers out to
tracing tools. I've got it all working with jaeger-tracing.
If this tracing middleware is also put into the storage nodes and the
proxy is tracing (because of a trace_sig or every x requests) then it'll
send an X-Backend-Tracing-Continue header and the tracing will continue
on the storage nodes giving you can complete request trace.

Still need to write some tests, and might default this middleware on the
SAIO proxy pipeline.

Neutron quota engine now accepts ""--force"" parameter in quota limit
update command. This is currently the default behaviour: the quota
engine does not check the resource usage before updating the quota
limit.

However, this is an intermediate step before changing the quota engine
behaviour. In Z+ (the exact release is not defined yet), the quota
engine will requiere ""--force"" parameter to set a quota limit regarless
of the resource usage. By default, the engine will check it.

Add OpaeDriver class which implements discover, program using opae.fpga
module.
a) discover finds FPGA resources which are composed of device objects and
accelerator objects. Beause the OPAE API does not currently support SR-IOV
properties, this will resort to sysfs paths to get this information (when an
accelerator object [VF] has been assigned to a guest).
b) program takes a path to a bitstream file and calls the OPAE partial
reconfiguration routines to load the bitstream
2. Add test cases for OpaeDriver
3. Add opae.fpga to requirements.txt

Run nova-integ/initial_setup.sh right after devstack install.
Then, as described in README.rst and nova-integ/README.txt,
you can run curl to check the APIs.

For queries, just run curl. Example:
   curl http://localhost/accelerator/v2/device_profiles

For creating objects with POST, or to bind/unbind ARQs use
the functions in nova-integ/cyborg-curl-utils.sh. Examples:
   create_device_profile mydevprof_name myfile.json
   create_arq mydevprof_name
   bind_arq arq-uuid
   unbind_arq arq_uuid

To delete objects, use curl directly. Example:
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost/accelerator/v2/arqs?arqs=uuid

Cyborg now supports both AFaaS and DaaS use cases.

Cyborg now queries Glance for function ID using openstack-sdk.
So, /etc/opentack/clouds.yaml must be set up. That is done by
default in devstack. (Bitstream download in the agent still
uses glance client.)

Added Placement client based on openstack-sdk. Traits get
updated after successful programming.

This change optimises the tox file for local
execution by sharing VENVs between different
tox targets that have common deps and usages.

e.g. all envs that just execute tools not use
the venv env and all docs related jobs share
the docs env.

this change also removes the pep8-constratits
env as the standard pep8 env already used
the upper constratits.

this change removes setting the constraints
form the install command wich is error prone
if cyborg chooses to support a lower constratit
env in the future in favor of passing constratits
via deps.

this change also enable more envs by default and skips
execution of an env if the python verion is not
installed on the local system.

the end goal of this change is to allow tox to be run
with out argument quickly while including all the test
that should be run locally before pushing a patch for review.

bindeps.txt has been extended to include the bindeps
for the docs and pdf-docs envs.

The removal of the envlist list value for unit test lessens the
confusion that the tempest test are tests in themselves and
hence we do not test the tests.

With the presents of the tox envlist, tox tries to run the tempest
tests as unit test, which results in failure and potential confusion.
The scope of tempest tests (Integration test) and unit test are
understandably different.

Since Glance offers multiple hashing algorithms and all other uses

the differences between the original and current.

test_list_policy_filter_by_name was looking for policies
with name 'test' and expected only one such policy to
be retrieved, but since tempest is running with multiple
concurrency and some other qos tests were also using same
policy name, this leads to test failure when this test
runs at same time with other such tests. This patch fixes
it by using random name for the policy for this test.

Add ping test for gateway IPs on all networks, to ensure
all gateways are reachable.

The releated Bugzilla reports an issue where some network
fabrics fail when using the current node ping test, which
pings the first node in each role. The fabric simply does
not forward traffic before the gateway has been pinged.

One can argue that the fabric in question is broken. However,
with the current implementation the first node in each role
actually ping tests only against it's own address? So adding
the test to ping the gateway addresses improves the validation
in general.

Make PingTestGatewayIPsMap a map of flatten lists

PingTestGatewayIPsMap elements may contain list of lists, causing
failures on roles that iterate over them. See [1] and #1950528 for
more info.

Add attr of networks and subnets to Networks resource

In the Networks resource tempaltes add the full resource
attributes to net_attributes_map. This is a partial cherry-pick of
commit 5b3878580a9768be7c7c39d3062f567eb5e13767.

Also the parameter {{role.name}}ControlPlaneSubnet is added in
overcloud.yaml.j2, the parameter was previously only used in
puppet/role.role.j2.yaml. This is a partial cherry-pick of
commit 7b8c6b07dad3ddebbf9966fc6c8ba3e8a7b4cd8a.

When connecting to some LDAP server software, the ldap client returns
bytes instances instead of the expected strings. This can result in
either being transparently converted to strings, when the data is
inserted via sqlalchemy into the database, or could be used as
input to other functions, and/or cached, which causes unexpected

The old variable for TLS v1.2 and below ciphers is renamed for

by deployments.

The bandit package has moved on from python 2.7 starting
with verions 1.7.0[0]. Since it isn't covered in the upper constraints
file provided by the openstack/requirements[1] the relevant jobs are likely to fail.

This patch imposes upper constraint on the package,
set to the last released version compatible with python 2.7.

  port['vif_details']['bound_drivers'] = {'0': 'ovn'}

If the port is not bound, this key won't be present in ""vif_details"".
This information is important for Nova, along with the VIF type, to
adequate the port plugin strategy or to know what kind of plugin
events are expected; currently, depending on the driver and the
connection type, Neutron sends a different set of vif-plugged events.
This is specially critical during live migration process, where the
network communication should be halted as little as possible.

Subports of a trunk should have the same status as the parent port.
However, with ovn, if the parent port is in DOWN status, the subports
are transitioned to ACTIVE as soon as they are attached to the trunk.

This commit updates the default neutron policies in
enable-secure-rbac.yaml to implement consistent support for project
personas (project-admin, project-member, and project-reader) with other
OpenStack services. The project-admin is still considered a system
administrator.

This behavior will change in future releases (likely Yoga) when we have
a community wide goal to finish system-scope adoption. At that point, we
can remove these overrides and use the defaults in neutron, which adhere to
system and project personas and we'll get more functionality without these
overrides.

This change implements all the project personas for placement, which is
really only two (project-admin and project-reader) since placement is
pretty much isolated to administrator use. There is one API left open to
project readers to get useage.

This file was modified by generating the default sample policy file in
placement:

  $ oslopolicy-sample-generator --namespace placement

Then, working through the file and implement project-admin instead of
the system peresona. After that, I used the
convert_policy_yaml_to_heat_template.py tool to update the existing
defaults in enable-secure-rbac.yaml.

The nova flavor for Octavia was previously created from puppet-octavia
but it didn't offer a convenient way to select the type of the API
endpoint (it uses public API endpoint by default while some deployments
don't have access to the external network from their controllers).

Moving the creation of the flavor to a tripleo-ansible role helps us to
use the existing configuration (the roles use the internal endpoints)
and centralizes the creation of all the resources required by Octavia in
a single place.

While it makes sense in some cases to get the final archive in the user
home directory, we might want to allow people to push those achives
somewhere else in the tree.

Using the new ""oooci_image_build_archive_dest"" parameter, we can
override the final location; it defaults to ansible_user_dir, in order
to not change the current behavior.

This patch also takes the opportunity to sanitize the ""workspace"" as a
source, especially in the ""post.yaml"" task file in order to ensure we're
using the same location, especially if we override the ""workspace""
parameter.

When deleting an attachment, if the driver's remove_export or the
detach_volume method call fails in the cinder driver, then the
attachment status is changed to error_detaching but the REST API call
doesn't fail.

The end result is:
- Volume status is ""available""
- Volume attach_status is ""detached""
- There is a volume_attachment record for the volume
- The volume may still be exported in the backend

The volume still being exported in the storage array is not a problem,
since the next attach-detach cycle will give it another opportunity for
it to succeed, and we also do the export on volume deletion.

So in the end leaving the attachment in error_detaching status doesn't
have any use and creates confusion.

This patch removes the attachment record when on an attachment delete
request if the error happens on remove_export or detach_volume calls.

This doesn't change how the REST API attachment delete operation
behaves, the change is that there will not be a leftover attachment
record with the volume in available and detached status.

There are cases where requests to delete an attachment made by Nova can
race other third-party requests to delete the overall volume.

This has been observed when running cinder-csi, where it first requests
that Nova detaches a volume before itself requesting that the overall
volume is deleted once it becomes `available`.

This is a cinder race condition, and like most race conditions is not
simple to explain.

Some context on the issue:

- Cinder API uses the volume ""status"" field as a locking mechanism to
  prevent concurrent request processing on the same volume.

- Most cinder operations are asynchronous, so the API returns before the
  operation has been completed by the cinder-volume service, but the
  attachment operations such as creating/updating/deleting an attachment
  are synchronous, so the API only returns to the caller after the
  cinder-volume service has completed the operation.

- Our current code **incorrectly** modifies the status of the volume
  both on the cinder-volume and the cinder-api services on the
  attachment delete operation.

The actual set of events that leads to the issue reported in this bug
are:

[Cinder-CSI]
- Requests Nova to detach volume (Request R1)

[Nova]
- R1: Asks cinder-api to delete the attachment and **waits**

[Cinder-API]
- R1: Checks the status of the volume
- R1: Sends terminate connection request (R1) to cinder-volume and
  **waits**

[Cinder-Volume]
- R1: Ask the driver to terminate the connection
- R1: The driver asks the backend to unmap and unexport the volume
- R1: The last attachment is removed from the DB and the status of the
      volume is changed in the DB to ""available""

[Cinder-CSI]
- Checks that there are no attachments in the volume and asks Cinder to
  delete it (Request R2)

[Cinder-API]

- R2: Check that the volume's status is valid. It doesn't have
  attachments and is available, so it can be deleted.
- R2: Tell cinder-volume to delete the volume and return immediately.

[Cinder-Volume]
- R2: Volume is deleted and DB entry is deleted
- R1: Finish the termination of the connection

[Cinder-API]
- R1: Now that cinder-volume has finished the termination the code
  continues
- R1: Try to modify the volume in the DB
- R1: DB layer raises VolumeNotFound since the volume has been deleted
  from the DB
- R1: VolumeNotFound is converted to HTTP 404 status code which is
  returned to Nova

[Nova]
- R1: Cinder responds with 404 on the attachment delete request
- R1: Nova leaves the volume as attached, since the attachment delete
  failed

At this point the Cinder and Nova DBs are out of sync, because Nova
thinks that the attachment is connected and Cinder has detached the
volume and even deleted it.

Hardening is also being done on the Nova side [2] to accept that the
volume attachment may be gone.

This patch fixes the issue mentioned above, but there is a request on
Cinder-CSI [1] to use Nova as the source of truth regarding its
attachments that, when implemented, would also fix the issue.

In change-id Iabf9c3fab56ffef50695ce45745f193273822b39 we left the
`volume_attachment` out of the expected attributes of the Volume OVO
(even when te DB layer is providing that information) because it was
breaking some unit tests.

This means that in some cases we are unnecessarily loading the
attachments again (manually or via lazy loading) once we have the volume
OVO because that field is not set.

In this patch we populate the `volume_attachment` when we load the
Volume OVO from the DB.

Check new segments added to OVN mechanism driver. This mechanism
driver does not inherit from ``SimpleAgentMechanismDriverBase``
because OVN has no agents (NOTE 1). However OVN mechanism driver
requires an OVN controller service in each deployed chassis. This
is how OVN driver knows the hosts using this backend.

The segments, attached to an external network (connected to a
physical network), can be mapped to a host if ther is a chassis (OVN
controller agent) in this host.

NOTE 1: OVN provides agent API compatibility, presenting the
controller and the metadata services as agents. But OVN mechanism
driver has no control or provides any information (via RPC) to
those services.

NOTE 2: this patch is the complementary of [1]. The missing code in
[1], the OVN part, is implemented in this patch, that depends on
the Neutron one.

By having some small portion of calls skip cache and go straight to
disk, we can ensure the cache is always kept fresh and never expires (at
least, for active containers). Previously, when shard ranges fell out of
cache there would frequently be a thundering herd that could overwhelm
the container server, leading to 503s served to clients or an increase
in async pendings.

Include metrics for hit/miss/skip rates.

Our current `attachment_delete` methods in the volume API and the
manager are using DB methods directly, which makes the OVOs present in
those methods get out of sync with the latest data, which leads to
notifications having the wrong data when we send them on volume detach.

This patch replaces DB method calls with OVO calls and moves the
notification call to the end of the method, where we have the final
status on the volume.

It also adds the missing detach.start notification when deleting an
attachment in the reserved state.

Both test_property_protection_with_missing_operation and
test_property_protection_with_misspelt_operation rely on a bug in Python
3.9: the ""]"" character in a section name is not read, so section
'^[0-9]' is read as '^[0-9'. This causes _compile_rule to fail and raise
the exception the tests are expecting.

In Python 3.10, this bug has been fixed and the exception is no longer
raised. Instead, CONFIG.get() raises a NoOptionError in _load_rules,
which is not caught.

Currently the gate assumes the upstream interface in the testing
machine is always running mtu 1500. We change this assumption by
using the facts collected from the host during bootstrap-host to
properly set MTU in the AIO user variables.

This is needed to prevent test failures while downloading internet
artifacts to containers during gate runs on nodepool providers
(such as recently added Limestone) which use a <1500 MTU.

SNAT rules are created on the seed hypervisor or seed host to allow
routing via this host immediately after provisioning overcloud hosts.
These rules are not persistent, so may disappear after a reboot. This
can lead to a loss of network connectivity after provisioning control
plane hosts.

This change adds a new role, iptables-persist, that persists all active
iptables rules. The role is executed in the SNAT playbook.

This role was adapted from Zuul's persistent-firewall role [1].

When a new OF controller is added or when new OF protocols are added to
a bridge, the OF controller is restarted. When that happens, the os-ken
``OfctlService`` instance removes the OF controller datapath and waits
for an update event that will add a new one. During this time no OF
controllers (datapaths) will be registered and any request will be
rejected with a ``InvalidDatapath`` exception.

This patch is a temporary workaround that prevents any command from
being executed just after those two described operations, providing
time to OVS to send the OF updates.

Maintaining project lower constraints has become an increasingly
difficult task, especially considering the new pip resolver.

That being considered, the TC has stated that it's up to project
maintainers to decide if they want to continue using lower constraints.
The Cinder project has already dropped the lower constraints job [2].

In order to reduce the burden, we dropped indirect dependencies from
the lower constraints file. This is now causing the lower constraints
job to time out:

   This is taking longer than usual. You might need to provide the
   dependency resolver with stricter constraints to reduce runtime.
   See https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/backtracking for guidance.
   If you want to abort this run, press Ctrl + C.

Since we don't really want to go back to maintaining a huge list of
lower constraints, it's time for us to remove the job.

This release picks up new commits to python-manilaclient since
the last release from stable/victoria.

This is being proposed as a convenience to help make sure stable
changes are being released. If the team is good with this going out,
please respond with a +1 to let the release team know it is OK to
proceed.

If it is not wanted at this time, or if there are more changes that
would be good to get merged before doing a stable release, please
leave a -1 with a comment with what the team would prefer. We can
then either abandon this patch, or wait for an update with a new
commit hash to use instead.

Fix errors found by new pycodestyle

pycodestyle 2.6.0 has some new errors, fix them.

Also bumped minimum hacking to 3.0.1 so it pulls in
the correct flake8, etc, libraries.

Added basepython directive in tox.ini since local
'tox -e pep8' runs were using python2 otherwise.

This change ensures the parameters for heat-dashboard are removed
from the base local_settings, because the parameters are now configured
in the independent setting files.

Note this change is required only in Wallaby and older and since Xena
the parameters are no longer included in the base local_settings.

When a new OF controller is added or when new OF protocols are added to
a bridge, the OF controller is restarted. When that happens, the os-ken
``OfctlService`` instance removes the OF controller datapath and waits
for an update event that will add a new one. During this time no OF
controllers (datapaths) will be registered and any request will be
rejected with a ``InvalidDatapath`` exception.

This patch is a temporary workaround that prevents any command from
being executed just after those two described operations, providing
time to OVS to send the OF updates.

Tis issue came up before also during we cap the Tempest
version for stable branch tests(the one moved to EM state).

Tempest use the tox constraints file while creating the tempest
virtual env in devstack/lib/tempest, installing the tempest
plugins and running the tests like in run-tempest ansible roles.
If anywhere tox constraints file is used differently then venv
will be recreated and installed tempest plugins will be gone from
that recreated venv so tempest will not be able to run the plugins
tests and fail job.

Current failure: https://aca43ed1a01d95dea0ee-dcdb6cbb330bdac08ffee1284f86c919.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/822225/3/check/octavia-v2-dsvm-scenario/f60e4d3/job-output.txt

Earlier I tried to fix it in a generic way by fetching the devstack
localrc - https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tempest/+/774913
but this solution does not seems working as we can see it is skipped
in current stable/train testing with tempest 26.1.0

Adding stable/train explicitly in list for using the stable constraint
in run-tempest role also which will be in sync with what devstack/lib/tempest
use. And later I will debug why generic way is not working.

Because of Tempest 26.1.0 and with stestr 2.5.1 (beacause of upper
constraints of stestr 2.5.1 in stable/train) which does not have
new args exclude-regex so let's fallback to old arg if new arg is passed.

When:
* the segments service plugin is enabled and
* we have multiple rpc worker processes (as in the sum of rpc_workers
  and rpc_state_report_workers, since both kind processes agent
  state_reports) and
* many ovs-agents report physnets,
then rabbitmq dispatches the state_report messages between the workers
in a round robin fashion, therefore eventually the state_reports of the
same agent will hit all rpc workers.

Unfortunately all worker processes have a 'reported_hosts' set to
remember from which host it has seen agent reports already. But right
after a server start when that set is still empty, each worker will
unconditionally write the received physnet-segment information into
the db. This means we multiply the load on the db and rpc workers by
a factor of the rpc worker count.

This patch tries to reduce the load on the db by adding another early
return before the unconditional db write.

After a successfull os-net-config run disable network config

There has been reports of cloud-init re-writing network config
files on reboot, resulting in incorrect network configuration.

This is the 2nd commit message:

Ensure cloud-init config dir exists

In some cases, it may happen cloud-init isn't installed (on the UC, for
instance).
In such cases, the directory doesn't exist, and ansible fails to push
the file to this location, leading to a deploy error.

Added controller_group_name to override the Controller group name from
which a backup would be taken.  ie:
```
openstack overcloud backup \
--extra-vars ""{'controller_group_name':'ControllerStandalone'}""
```
This is useful if you are not using the default Controller group but
something else such as one of these:
    ControllerAllNovaStandalone
    ControllerNoCeph
    ControllerNovaStandalone
    ControllerOpenstack
    ControllerSriov
    ControllerStorageDashboard
    ControllerStorageNfs

In BMaaS configs, such as where one may use an undercloud or a remote host,
one may use the legacy means of invoking introspection of a baremetal node,
which is to call the inspector API directly.

While ironic's API also supports this capability through a state change,
people still do it, and it is easy to miss on an undercloud as your typically
directly interacting with the software running locally. But when the API
endpoint is remote, you cannot connect to it if it is not permitted via the
firewall.
