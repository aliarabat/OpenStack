This patch changes recent FileManager construction.

The older one requires single centralized file manager which needs
gateway specific methods (e.g. put_log). However, IMHO, more general
abstraction is suitable to develop the custom file managers as you want
so that this patch reconstruct the FileManager class like as:

StorletFileManager (This class):
    |
    |--- storlet_manager (instance) ------ get_file   (method)
    |                                   |
    |                                   -- write_file (method)
    |
    |--- dependency_manager (instance) --- get_file   (method)
    |                                   |
    |                                   -- write_file (method)
    |
    |--- log_manager (instance) ---------- get_file   (method)
                                        |
                                        -- write_file (method)

Each manager instance only requires 2 methods

- get_file: return a file instance to read from
- write_file: take 2 args, object_name to write to, and file object
              to read content from

On the invocation_flow perspective, this patch refactors the cache
management flow as splitting the routine into storlet apps and
dependency files. And then, this makes each flow to go straight forward
without ""if is_storlet"" branch.

Misc.
- Cleanup tests more!

Adds a new exception for DuplicatePropertyName and catches it in
appropriate places in the Images v1 and v2 APIs.

* Returns a 409 (Conflict) when a user tries to add a duplicate
  property name when updating an image by PATCH (v2) or PUT (v1).
* In the v2 API, returns a 400 (Bad Request) when a user tries
  to create an image with duplicate property names in the request.
* Leaves the v1 API behavior unmodified when a user tries to
  create an image with duplicate property names in the request, as
  (unlike for v2) the current behavior does not cause a 500 (and
  hopefully v1 won't be around too much longer anyway).
  ** using v1 API via python-glanceclient: the first property
     name/value pair is used, the other is ignored; property name is
     created as all-lowercase regardless of how it was specified
  ** using v1 API directly: single all-lowercase property name is
     created, values of the duplicate name/value pairs are
     concatenated together, comma-separated

Glance is case-insensitive when detecting duplicate property names,
but it allows a user to store the name in any case combination.
(This behavior is unchanged.)

In current code files, the exception handle of deleting vnfd
in functional tests like this:

    self.assertIsNotNone(vnfd_id)
    try:
        self.client.delete_vnfd(vnfd_id)
    except Exception:
        assert False, ""vnfd Delete failed""

This case just judge the failure of deleting vnfd. But if it didn't
delete vnfd, there is no possibility of failure. So this code:

   except Exception:
        assert False, ""vnfd Delete failed""

will be skipped. But actually, most cases we just think about delete
vnfd successfully. This judgment is wrong.
So add a exception handle like this:

    try:
        self.client.delete_vnfd(vnfd_id)
    except Exception:
        assert False, ""vnfd Delete failed""
    try:
        vnfd_d = self.client.show_vnfd(vnfd_id)
    except Exception:
        assert True, ""Vnfd Delete success"" + str(vnfd_d) + str(Exception)

Use show_vnfd(vnfd_id) again, which make sure the success of deleting vnfd.

Before this commit, paths like /v1/white%20space are logged as
/v1/white%2520space by log_request. This can lead to irritations
when analyzing log files and is unnecessary.

The reason lies in the fact, that the quote function is
effectively called twice on the path string, because the
method ""path"" of a request object does already quote it.

This commit ensures that the path gets only quoted once.

On demand data migration allows customers a natural way to migrate
their data from other storage clouds (or file system) into Swift.
This is achieved without being dependent on any special support
from the other clouds.

It's obvious that on demand data migration uses network to transfer
user's data from old storage into Swift, an operation that consumes
certain time and resources. On the other hand, data migration
provides various benefits for the end users. In particular, users
may start easily work with Swift and access their data through Swift
even if their data is stored on some other storage provider. Users
will no longer need to be concerned how to migrate their data into
Swift. In addition on demand data migration provides end users a
continuous access to their data during data migration, since they
don't need to wait till the whole data is migrated. Data migration
layer will access remote cloud only once per single object.

An important aspect of proposed functionality is the need to be
highly versatile for different kind of storage clouds or file
systems, that users may wish to migrate their data from. This commit
includes various access drivers and in addition the suggested
modular architecture allows to easily add more drivers.

Our model assumes that the new cloud (Swift) is the most updated one.
If object was migrated, it will not be migrated again. The same, if
object was migrated and deleted, it will not be migrated again.

In this commit
--------------
1. Data Migration Middleware. (data_migration.py)

a. Validates data migration setup by expecting metadata of container

b. Object migration on demand.

2. Storage Access Drivers (data_migrator_drivers.py)
Contains implementation for access drivers that are used by Data
Migration MW to access remote clouds.

a. Migration from file system ( default implementation )

b. Additional patch will contain migration from storage clouds,
using Apache LibCloud (Optional).
To avoid dependence between Swift and Apache LibCloud, this
implementation is an optional and will only work if LibCloud is
installed in Python. It should be noticed that the benefit of
LibCloud is high, since LibCloud comes prepackaged with drivers
for Amazon S3,Atmos, Microsoft Azure, Google storage,Rackspace
Cloudfiles,Nimbus.

c. Migration from another Swift by using swift-client.( optional)

d. One can easily implement new driver and add it to the
configuration of Data Migration MW.

The general flow of object migration on demand as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Data Migration MW let Swift to handle original request without
any modifications and activates migration logic only if Swift
returned '404 Not Found' as a response for GET / HEAD object
requests.
2. Data Migration MW inspects then local container metadata to
identify whether local container is linked with another cloud.
It then pick up a correct access driver and sends GET object
request to the remote cloud to read an object. Upon receiving
a response from the remote cloud, object is stored locally in
Swift ( without reading an entire object into memory ) and
then it returns a response with object's data to the user.
Each object will be migrated only once, and all subsequent
GET / HEAD requests to the same object will not trigger data
migration anymore.

Current limitations
-------------------
1. Due to code complexity, unified view ( described in blue
print ) is not part of this commit. Will be committed separately.

2. The proposed architecture, keeps read access credentials to
the old cloud, as part of Swift container's system metadata.
All keys related credentials are filtered and are not returned
back to the user. Additional patches may improve the security
of credentials by using encryption.

3. Data migration supports the maximal object size that Swift
can handle in a single request and doesn't yet uses multi part
uploads to handle objects of more than 4GB size.

An example code how to use this feature to migrate data
from file system:

Durable fragment set (which has both .data and .durable) can be
reclaimed (deleted in the worst case) in racing condition.

For example, if all PUTs are in older than reclaime age (i.e. request
X-Timestamp << (now - reclaime_age), e.g. reconstruction PUT)

The following sequence *may* happen in the older code:

===============================================================================
2 nodes have different timestamp object each other with same path
(overwritten), and then,

1. a reconstructor (t0) attempts a PUT and object-server make a
   t0.data file
2: another reconstructor (t1) attempts a PUT and object-server makes a
   t1.data file

likely:
[a reconstructor] -(PUT t0)-> [object-sever] <-(PUT t1)-[another reconstructor]

And then,

3. object-server makes a t0.durable and call cleanup_list_dir which triggers to
   remove t1.data because it doesn't have .durable and older than reclaim age.

4. After that, object-server makes a t1.durable and call cleanup_list_dir will
   remove all .data .durable file older than the newest t1.durable.

5. finally all .data files are gone, unexpectedly.

===============================================================================

This patch prevents such an unexpected racing cleanup. With this code,
object-server at the state 4 (above) will search the newest .durable file
which has at least 1 .data file before cleanup and then keep the durable
frag set as the most recent durable fragment set even if newer durable
(but no .data files) files are found in the device. The orphaned durable
will be reclaimed expecting to be reconstructed again.

zuul-cloner instead of a regular git clone.

Additionally, a new '-z' option has been added to run_functests.sh.
This option sets a special environment variable,
""SOURCE_REPOSITORIES_USE_ZUUL_FOR_GIT"" prior to running the tests. The
source repositories element will read and honor this variable by
changing any 'git' type to 'zuul'.

This feature closes a bug where elements could not use the ""Depends-On:""

Several Neutron scenarios should not take care about creation of network
resources. All this logic should be done by Network context.

Changes in this patch:
- Add ability to setup Network context to create only networks without
  subnets. It is needed for next scenarios:
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_list_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_update_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_delete_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_list_routers
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_update_routers
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_delete_routers
- Deprecate scenario arguments for creation non-related resources(for example:
  networks, subnets). Add Network context to default contexts. Affected
  scenarios:
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_list_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_update_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_delete_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_list_routers
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_update_routers
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_delete_routers
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_list_ports
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_update_ports

To apply the fix for a liberasurecode issue [1], we need hard depencency
of liberasurecode requires >=1.3.1. However current binary dependency
maintainance tool ""bindep"" works only for packagers' repository. (i.e. it
reffers the version of apt/yum/etc...) And nothing cared on the binary
built from source.

This patch provides a way to detect incompatible liberasurecode and
reject to use the version when the ec driver instantiated.

NOTE:
- This dependency managemnet depends on erasurecode_version.h header
  file in liberasurecode. i.e. it cannot care of overwritten .so library
  after PyECLib built once.
- This patch may be unnecessary if packagers' repo updated to 1.3.1
  soon. And, IMO, updating packagers' repo immediately is the best wa
  because this patch will cause gate failures which is using
  liberasurecode<1.3.1 installation via bindep in gerrit.

1. Kuryr initialization should not be dependent on neutron availability.
2. Currently neutron client creation attributes can not be used from
config file. Reason is neutron client gets created even before config
file is used while starting kuryr server.

In this fix kuryr neutron client creation is being moved from Kuryr
server initialization to the the following libnetwork api handlers.
These api handlers can be first point of contact where neutron will be
queried. For example, /NetworkDriver.Leave and
/NetworkDriver.DeleteNetwork could be first point of interactions with
neutron in case Kuryr has got restarted and user tries to delete a
container or existing network(created before Kuryr restart)
respectively.

/IpamDriver.RequestPool
/IpamDriver.RequestAddress
/NetworkDriver.DeleteNetwork

Right now it is possible for cleaning to fail. It will cause an
attempt to tear down cleaning ports, which, if it does not succeed,
will leave cleaning_vif_port_id in port(group)'s internal_info, as
the port might still exist in neutron. If this happens, and the user
decides to disable auto cleaning, he may be stuck with
cleaning_vif_port_id in internal_info forever, unless he modifies the
DB manually. This may cause troubles, as DHCP options will be updated
for the leftover cleaning port instead of tenant port, or, if the
port was in fact deleted, to fail, complaining that the port is not
found.

This change allows for expired objects to be deleted from disk
by the object auditor. Also, the container replicator will be
removing expired objects out of the container databases before
replicating.

For pre-existing container databases, upon the first PUT object
requst after a code update the container db will be updated with the new
expired table. This allowes for a easy transition to the new
design for expiring objects.

We now have two elements for most of our distros which do different
things. The naming for what these different elements do is very unclear
to a user who is not intimately familiar with the elements. Lets rename
our distro elements into *-cloudimage or *-packageinstall and document
the differences. This also allows us to make the -packageinstall
elements provide the packages which -minimal leaves out and which users
generally expect to have (like ssh).

This change adds support for to build images using diskimage-builder
which are capable to boot in UEFI based systems. Currently RHEL 7, CentOS 7,
Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora images have been tested and verified for
x86_64/amd64 architectures.

To build an UEFI capable image,

1. Two Partions were created with GPT partition table. First partition
   contains the EFI System Partition(ESP), while the second partition is
   the root file system. parted is used for creating the partitions.

2. Bootloader element pkg-map has been added with grub-efi which
   installs dependent packages for default and redhat distributions.

3. As part of installing grub boot loader, the ESP partition is mounted
   to /boot/efi directory of the root file system so that grub will
   install required grubx64.efi and other dependent packages in ESP
   partition.

4. Grub configuration files are modified to work with respective
   distributions.

This shows how Rally-as-a-Service can be implemented.

Key ideas:

  * Move oslo_config.cfg.CONF initialization
    from rally.cli.cliutils to rally.api.API.init_config()

  * New class rally.api.API is a base class for all APIs

  * New approach proposes using API instance methods, in
    opposite to static methods. Existing API classes (Task,
    Deployment, Verification) are now used as instances

  * New class rally.aas.service.Service provides single
    endpoint for all Rally API.
    The main benefit of using Service and APIs instances is
    having ability to work with unlimited number of remote Rally
    services as well as with local Rally, within single process.
    This approach also gives flexibility for future
    improvements

How to try this:

 1. Local Service via CLI

    Play with rally/aas/demo_cli without --location argument
    to get data from local Rally Service

 2. Remote Service via CLI

    Launch rally/aas/demo_server in another terminal
    and try rally/aas/demo_cli with additional argument
    --location http://127.0.0.1:8000

 3. Local Service as a Lib

    >>> from rally.aas import service
    >>> svc = service.Service()
    >>> tasks = svc.Task.list()
    >>> deployments = svc.Deployment.list()

 4. Remote Service as a Lib (demo server must be running)

    >>> from rally.aas import service
    >>> svc = service.Service(""http://127.0.0.1:8000"")
    >>> tasks = svc.Task.list()
    >>> deployments = svc.Deployment.list()

 5. Using Rally API explicitly

   * Legacy usage (does not support location):

     >>> from rally import api
     >>> api.API.init_config()  # set up DB connection, once
     >>> tasks = api.Task.list()
     >>> deployments = api.Deployment.list()

   * With API instancemethods, for local Rally:

     >>> from rally import api
     >>> api.API.init_config()  # set up DB connection, once
     >>> tasks = api._Task().list()
     >>> deployments = api._Deployment().list()

   * With API instancemethods, for remote Rally
     (demo server must be running):

     >>> from rally import api
     >>> api.API.init_config()  # set up DB connection, once
     >>> location = ""http://127.0.0.1:8000""
     >>> tasks = api.Task(location).list()
     >>> deployments = api.Deployment(location).list()

  6. Finally, lets make a fun and use Rally Service
     as proxy to another Rally Service:

   run demo server (port 8000 by default) and another demo server
   on port 8001 and location pointed to first service:

        $ ./rally/aas/demo_server
        $ ./rally/aas/demo_server 8001 http://127.0.0.1:8000

   now we can query service http://127.0.0.1:8000 via proxy service:

        $ ./rally/aas/demo_cli <command args> --location http://127.0.0.1:8001

It came to my attention that some old rings may be moving parts ""too""
aggressively when faced against the new rebalance algorithm.

It's not so much that the balance or dispersion is getting *bad* - but
more so it's FIXING ALL THE THINGS in one go - even though no weights
are being changed.

To control the movement of parts the new pretend_min_part_hours_locked
command will reset all the last_part_moves so that it *feels* like the
ring can't rebalance *anything* even though it would really like to.

In order to allow only a *subset* of parts to come out of the lock at
a time (so the operator can control how many parts move) the
pretend_min_part_hours_passed command now accepts an optional ratio
argument which can be less than 100% - it will choose the least
recently moved parts and make them movable.

This is an evolution of a previous idea to allow operators to control
the number of parts moved per rebalance - but adapted with an eye
towards respecting essential un-avoidable part movement.  Since
min_part_hours is already ignored for failed devices (and other
essential part assignment like duplicate-part/multiple-replica to
device or replica count adjustment) limiting part movement with
pretend_min_part_hours_[locked|passed] will safely allow devices to be
failed and removed from the ring using normal swift-ring-builder
commands.

I found it sort of interesting to play around with on the command line
to functionally observe the effect of min_part_hours - so it might be
useful as a general tool in dev.

As always using pretend_min_part_hours on production rings carries
some risk.  You need to closely monitor your rebalance cycle as you
are circumventing some safety measures in the rings partition
placement algorithm.  But if you move slowly and carefully you might
be able to pull one out of the fire!

When user script does get request to Ironic API,
the Resource can update own etag, got from Manager.
When doing update request, the user can go with etag
stored in Resource object. If this etag is old, the client
will fail and force the user either to stop updating or
do get request again to update the etag.

There are two ways to configure trunk port:

 * C1: When segmentation details for trunk ports are inherited from

   Added implementation for cisco, arista, OVS on Linux.

 * C2: When user set segmentation details for trunk port explicitly.
   Switch should support VLAN translation for this case.
   Implement only for OVS on Linux, experimental.

NetmikoSwitch.plug_port_to_network() is deprecated. New bind_port()
should be used instead.

New switch config option: vlan_translation_supported was introduced.

Introducing SWIFT_ROOT environment variable that allows to override
default swift_dir which is /etc/swift. When not set, defaults to
/etc/swift

This patch was done in the context of setting up multiple Swift
clusters on shared hardware. This can also be used to run
Swift using a non default swift configuration directory (i.e. other
than /etc/swift)

Note: Please export SWIFT_ROOT (e.g. export SWIFT_ROOT=/etc/myswiftdir)

This patch adds the ability to store Account ACL in JSON format for
KeystoneAuth. Right now it only supports storing user ids. Keystone
allow user names to change but not the user id. Basing our ACL on
user id makes a lot more sense. In the future, we can support a
combination of project and user ids.

In addition, this patch extracted common code from TempAuth into
AuthMixin. KeystoneAuth and TempAuth both inherit from AuthMixin.

zun create/run commands pull image if not exist So, two
extra parameter passed image_pull_policy and image_driver

While pull image using command:

   zun pull repo:tag
it pass only 3 argument in method  _do_image_pull for that

'run': dib can run and create images
'test': possible to run test cases
'full': adds some other development tools like git-gerrit

This was tested using the follwing docker images:

bifrost already aims to support installing and managing ironic on a
remote host opposing to installing ironic locally where bifrost is
installed itself.

Let's move the testing procedure to execute under this assumption as well.

Changes include:
- moving *.example files out of inventory to not interfere with ansible
  using multiple inventory sources
- executing tasks locally is removed or added where needed
- changes to test playbooks and test-bifrost.sh files to accomodate
  for these changes
- add packages needed to build virtualbmc and its dependencies to the
  list of required packages in 'bifrost-create-vm-nodes' role (in
  progress)

Author: Kyle L. Henderson <kyleh@us.ibm.com>

    Enable oslo_middleware proxy header parsing

""Heat has moved to using oslo_middleware for the http proxy header
parsing, however the default is to not parse the headers.  When
the external protocol differs from the internal protocol this
parsing is required in order for heat to work properly since it
will return 302 redirects to the client during some operations
(such as delete stack).

An example of this is when using haproxy with https configured
for the external protocol and http for the internal protocol.
If the oslo_middleware does not parse the headers, then any
302 redirects would specify a url with http rather than
correctly specifying https and the heat client would fail to
connect on the redirect url.""

In current implementation, automated tiering daemons make derivative
containers in end-users' account.

But this behavior causes the following problems:
    1. Derivative container names can conflict with end-user's container names
    2. Derivative containers are listed in result of GET account,
       even though end-user doesn't make the containers
    3. End-users can update objects in derivative containers,
       even though they should be updated only by automated tiering daemons

This patch changes daemons to make derivative containers in hidden account.
If end-user's account name is 'acc', hidden account '.tiered_acc' will be used.

This patch changes behavior of GET container response too.
Object records in response of GET container request for tiered container
will have ""bytes"" and ""hash"" of entity object, even though the object is
replaced with link object.

 1. uses _record_to_dict as the row_transform_func that is passed to
    _list_object_iter
 2. passes a new flag 'full' to _iter_objects_iter that will include all

It also changes the pivot constaint RECORD_TYPE_PIVOT_NODE to
RECORD_TYPE_PIVOT so it matches the naming of the object record type.

a class to make information about which object should be moved and
where the objects should be moved to. ConsistencyDiskFile is class a
class to make information about which object is in inconsistent state

In autoamted tiering, there will be some link objects and referred
objects. The link objects are in original (user-defined) container
and the referred objects are in derivative (automatically made by
daemons) container. Swift end users can see objects in original
container. So if Swift end users want to DELETE tiered objects,
the uses can send DELETE requests to only objects in original
container. Therefore, tiering daemons should propagate the DELETE
to the referred objects. In currenct automated tiering implementation,
Tiering daemons patrol object-servers' devices and if the daemons
find tombstones, the daemons try to send DELETE requests to
objects in derivative containers. But this implementation have a
prpblem. The problem is that if there are too many objects in
object-servers, the patrol take long time greater than reclaim age
of tombstones. In this case, tiering daemons cannot find tombstones,
and there will be orphan (not referred) objects in derivative
containers.

This patch changes the implementation by filtering patrol targets
by comparing object lists from original containers and derivative
containers.

This patch is for discussion.
This patch is not update tests for this change.

Check that phases of different elements don't include the same script

This revealed some issues.  There are elements that are clearly not
supposed to be used together, however I still think we're better off
enforcing different names.

The ""-minimal"" builds have their ""distro-name"" environment files
renamed to have ""minimal"" in it and not conflict wit the non-minimal
versions.

11-yum-dnf.bash was duplicated between fedora-minimal and fedora.
Centralise that in ""yum"" which is common to both.

Move default in ubuntu-core from ""ubuntu""'s distro-name.  ubuntu-core
doesn't check for missing values, so it seems sane to set this there.

Alarm monitor initially integrated with OpenStack Ceilometer.
This patch is proposed to leverage Monasca in Tacker.
OpenStack Monasca is a highly scalable, performant, fault-tolerant
monitoring solution. Monasca support is basically similar
to Ceilometer support in Tacker. Currently, Monasca-based auto-scaling
has been introduced in Heat. Therefore, the main motivation
is to leverage  Monasca resources in Heat. Monasca will be
responsible for monitoring and the backend policies like
auto-scaling will be handled by Tacker.

Currently, retry and wait logic is written in mix with the

We can use the behaviour pattern to refactor it.
e.g.

There are a number of global block-device commands that don't make
sense in a multiple-partition world -- in cases where you're building
your own block-device configuration or using the ""vm"" element (which
uses it's own block-device configs).

Currently we look for the ""mkfs->mkfs_root"" entry in the configuration
file and merge these global values in -- but only for the fall-through
case where you don't specify a config-file and aren't using the vm
element.  Otherwise these are silently ignored.

This is done via entries the ""params"" file, so these values are passed
to every instantiation of the block-device object unnecessarily;
making it rather confusing as to when they are actually used.

Since these are put in to maintain base backwards compatibility, I
think we are better off keep all logic about this out of
dib-block-device and putting the values into the default configuration
file.  Additionally, make it clear via documentation and run-time
checks when these values are not going to work.

Currently the only way to keep an eye on replication progress in
clusters using rsync replication is by watching the replicator logs
for messages that expose a few stats. Monitoring this in an automated
and consistent way that makes alerting possible then requires quite a
lot of extra infrastructure, or gets hacky: either centralize and
filter your replicator logs using something like Logstash and
Elasticsearch, or worse, scrape logs locally; in either case, regexing
and extracting the useful numbers, when they could just be exposed in
a more machine-friendly and easily accessible way.

So, this reworks a bit of the existing status reporting to use a dict
that contains all the existing log line stats, plus a bit more of what
the replicator is already tracking internally. It writes that same
dict out to the object.recon file so that those raw numbers are made
available to any system that needs them via the object-server's
/recon/replication/object endpoint. The freshness of these stats is
still controlled with the stats_interval config option.

This also adds a heartbeat timestamp and completed replication cycle
counter. The heartbeat is updated each time the replicator writes the
status line and recon entries, and is useful to help locate stalled
replicators in the cluster (there is code that tries to prevent
stalls, but it still occurs under specific types of disk failures and
does not recover after the disk is replaced). This at least allows for
an automated response to stalled replicators, rather than requiring a
human to log in, kill it, and restart it.

The cycle counter is useful for Swift management planes that attempt
to do automated ring rebalances/pushes, or otherwise determine whether
the cluster is healthy enough for someone to perform one. When an
operator needs to perform a number of rebalances to gradually
increase weight on new capacity in a cluster, the minimum hours set
in the ring is not the only thing to take into account; it's also
necessary to ensure, before beginning a successive rebalance, that
every replicator has completed at least the previous rebalance cycle
to move relocated data. In addition, there may have been handoff data
written during that initial rebalance cycle, so waiting for a second
cycle to complete is usually a Good Idea™.

In other situations it's helpful for such a management plane to
determine whether any nodes in the cluster are finishing normal,
non-rebalance cycles at a much lower rate than other nodes (happens
when disk issues crop up that do not otherwise result in hard
failure during scans/reads). The cycle counter is a relatively simple
way to meet both of these needs.

In this patch, following parts are added or modified
* Add API to force changing a policy of a container
* Add object-transferrer daemon to send objects according to
  the ring of the changed policy
* A container to be planned to change its policy is tagged by
  sysmeta 'X-Container-Sysmeta-Prev-Index'. This stores the
  previous index of storage policy.
* Outline of changing policy process for some container is as
  follows (it is similar to reconciler's process)
  1. User orders to change the storage policy of container by
     Container POST method
  2. Container-replicator checks if a container is orderred to
     change the policy, and if so, replicator create a special
     container and enqueue objects info to this container so that
     object-transferrer can really migrate the policy of objects
  3. Container-update notifies to a system account for policy
     changing that a special container is created
  4. Object-transferrer finds objects to be transferred
* Add headers which show each policy's stats for Container
  GET/HEAD to find the progress of policy changing

Above procedures can minimize the burden of container DB and
keep user-side API atomic

This change introduces a new config option 'processes' to the
container sync daemon. The daemon spawns a new process per each
container to sync, up to the 'processes' limit. When the limit
is reached, the daemon waits for one of the processes to finish.

The 'spawning pattern' follows that of e.g. the container updater
The daemon process communicates with pipes with the child processes
to keep track of sync statistics. This, again, follows the container
updater pid2filename usage only with pipes instead of files.

The default for processes is set to 1, so that by default a single
child process is spawned in addition to the daemon.

This patch is closely related to [1] which adds thread level
concurrency to the sync daemon. [2] gives full details on
performance measurements showing the gain in throughput when
applying different levels of concurrency to the sync daemon.

Previously the container sync daemon stats would be updated directly
from the container_sync and container_row_sync methods. This makes it
harder to split a container_sync operation out to a separate process
or thread as proposed in [1]. For example, special care must be taken
to correctly reset any daemon stats in a forked process before
accumulating stats in that process.

This patch refactors the stats handling so that the container_sync and
container_sync_row methods now return a stats dict containing only
incremental updates for stats, and the daemon then applies returned
container stats to its stats dict.

This required a good deal of test refactoring, and in the process it
was discovered that some unit tests were obscuring errors. In
particular test_container_sync_first_loop and
test_container_sync_second_loop in test/unit/container/test_sync.py
seem to have been erroneous since [2]. These tests have been replaced
with new tests that mock the container_sync_row method in order to
better isolate and verify the behavior of the container_sync
method. The container_sync_row method is covered by other tests.

This change introduces the following decorators:

1. policy_checker - checks the policy of the method using the policy
   string passed as a parameter;

2. <resource>_is_subcontroller - checks if the endpoint is being
   accessed through subcontroller, meaning some operations are not
   allowed;

3. api_version_checker - checks that the endpoint itself, the request
   body and the arguments passed in request correspond to what our
   API expects at the given microversion.

These decorators need to be used in this exact order, to preserve the
previous order of checks in the API.

The unittest to check that the exposed methods contain the
policy.authorize call is removed. Instead, we assert this during the
API startup.

The decorator module is added as a dependency, as it is the only one
that is able to preserve the funtion signature in python 2. We need
this so that wsme's expose continues to work properly.

Full write-up and description here:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/User:Physcx

Adds a buffer between the network layer and the disk layer for object-server so
disk_chunk_size affects both read and write size now. This change was inspired
by a problem with chunked transfers and eventlet's wsgi readchunked having
performance issues with large chunked read requests. The change also allows
network_chunk_size to be optimized independently from the size of writes to the
disk.

Currently, we load memcache config settings once, when the memcache
middleware is instantiated. This patch, based on ring.py, allows
memcache.conf to be reloaded at regular intervals. When the memcache
middleware is instantiated, it sets the minimum amount of time that
should pass between reloads. This value can be set in
proxy-server.conf or in memcache.conf. Every time the memcache
middleware gets called, it checks to see if the specified amount of
time has elapsed. If so, it then determines whether or not
memcache.conf has been modified since the last load.
If it has, we then reload the config settings.

proliferation of bugs marked as RFEs sometime even trivial
enhancements. On the other hand some significant RFEs doesn't get
the visibilty because it is buried in the huge list of RFE bugs.

This patchset proposes a middle ground where launchpad blueprint
will be used request for enhancement and still doesn't need an
elaborate spec write up to bring the new enhancement. Instead
we can use the weekly meeting, ML and implementation gerrit to
have the discussion, approve and merge.

The following opts can be removed this cycle as per deprecation
policy:
* swift_store_auth_version
* swift_store_auth_address
* swift_store_user
* swift_store_key
The params from the swift conf file will be used instead. This
patch includes a detailed release note that talks about the steps
users will have to take if using swift store as the backend.

Eliminating these options entails that the swift conf file MUST
now be used whenever the swift glance_store driver is used, and
this in turn has entailed some changes in driver logic (where the
presence/absence of the swift conf file was used to decide the course
of execution at some branch points).

When ironic is deployed with zmq driver instead of default
rabbit one, any actions that related to rpc call
cause 500 Internal Error. This is because redis matchmaker
fails to set rpc topic correct and the host is not recognized
as the RPC call destination.
As the result when ironic is deployed with zmq, ``server`` parameter,
destination host, should be explicitly passed to rpc context and
hostname should be erased from the topic.
This relieves from the necessity to correct rpc topics in redis
matchmaker and force zmq driver to use destination defined by HashRing
ironic implementation (instead of RoundRobin).

This patch replaces (and deprecates) node.instance_info['configdrive']

The RPC version is changed to 1.42 because do_node_deploy() can take a new

Previously, when getting an EC object, if all backend
nodes returned 200, but a durable quorum of fragments
was not achieved (i.e. a mix of objects' fragments),
then the proxy would always return 503.

If all backend nodes returned either 404 or 200, but a
durable quorum of fragments was not achieved, the proxy
would sometimes return 503 and sometimes return 404. The
outcome depended on whether, on getting a 404, the
ResumingGetter could proceed to get a 200 response or not.
The proxy would only return 404 if one of the getters had
a *last* status of 404.

If there are insufficient fragments to achieve a quorum,
but otherwise no errors, the proxy should return a 404.
This patch modifies the ECObjectController analysis of
""bad"" backend responses to include the history of all
getters' responses, such that previously ignored 404
backend responses are now considered when forming the
proxy response.

When using ssync to revert EC fragments to a
*handoff* node, the ssync receiver will indicate
that the reverted fragment is missing even if the
receiver has another fragment of same object at
same time or newer time. When the ssync sender PUTs
the fragment the receiver then rightly gets a 409
conflict due to the other existing fragment.

Ssync to a *primary* node behaves differently and
allows the reverted fragment to be PUT alongside
any existing fragments with different indexes at
the same time. However, the ssync receiver will
currently indicate that the fragment to revert is
missing even if it finds another fragment of the
same object *at a newer time*. This will then
cause a 409 conflict when the sender attempts to
revert its older fragment.

This is undesirable because (a) it wastes bytes
sent over network that will not be written at the
receiver, and (b) it causes receiver 'failure'
events that may cause an early disconnect and
always result in the entire ssync run being
considered failed.  Consequently none of the
successfully sent objects are reported as sync'd,
so none get deleted on the sender side.

This patch changes the receiver missing_check
behavior on handoff nodes to check if any
conflicting fragment exists and if so indicate to
the sender that it's fragment is not in sync but
should not be sent. The sender does not include
that object in the in_sync_objs that it returns to
its caller (i.e. the reconstructor).

The patch also results in newer fragments on the
receiver always resulting in the sender not attempting
to PUT data.

Currently, Patrole switches the role for the primary Tempest creds
in order to do RBAC testing validation. This is a harmless act
when using dynamic credentials, as they are deleted after test
execution anyway.

However, when using pre-provisioned credentials, this means that the
roles for the set of credentials included in the accounts.yaml file
is permanently changed -- even after test execution. The credentials
in the accounts.yaml acquire the test role defined by `[patrole]
rbac_test_role` but lose the original roles before running any
Patrole tests. This means that it is entirely possible that the
roles enumerated in the accounts.yaml may be wrong after test
execution. Thus, Patrole testing can cause the pre-provisioned
credentials to behave unexpectedly when running, for example,
regular Tempest tests using the same credentials.

Because this behavior is undesirable, Patrole should restore any
credentials changed during test execution after test execution
using the `atexit` module which calls the `_restore_credentials`
callback on interpreter termination.

Note that this is not a bulletproof solution because, as the `atexit`
docs mention [0]:

  The functions registered via this module are not called when the
  program is killed by a signal not handled by Python, when a Python
  fatal internal error is detected, or when os._exit() is called.

Under normal circumstances, however, this commit ensures that the
credentials that are modified during test execution are restored
to their original values if pre-provisioned credentials are set up
in tempest.conf.

Note that this behavior can best be confirmed when using one set
of primary/admin creds in the accounts.yaml file and running the
tests serially so that the creds that are modified belong to the
only Member-role creds defined in the accounts.yaml file.

Adds new endpoint `v1/boot_config` to serve boot scripts and
configs directly from Ironic API (currently supported are iPXE boot
script).

The endpoint is public and requires no authentication.
Note that although API version is bumped, this endpoint does not
check the requested API version and relies solely on config options
enabling it, as iPXE firmware can not insert custom HTTP request headers.

New config option `CONF.api.restrict_boot_config` which is similar to
`CONF.api.restrict_lookup` but also allows nodes in ACTIVE state if
node is using 'netboot'.

Boot script API:

Request: GET v1/boot_config

Description:
resolves Ironic API and renders Jinja template
for (iPXE) boot script directly in API w/o RPC calls to conductor.

Boot config:

Request: GET v1/boot_config/<MAC>

Description:
resolves the node by provided MAC address,
gets complete rendered boot config over RPC from the conductor
which manages this node and then serves it from API.
For compatibility reasons supports both dash-separated and
colon-separated MAC address forms.

If we limit ourselves to only using (or mocking) the get_hashes and

better chance of maintaining strong assertions on the behavior of the
auditor without coupling these tests with needless additional
maintenance burden when changing the implementation of suffix hashing.

  * The 'return_value' is not too large. Roughly more than 1-2 lines.

This is not an exhaustive patch and there could be candidates for
changing that were missed.

The reason for doing this is that it cleans up the test function
argument list. Less arguments to keep track of. And is cleaner code,
in my opinion.

To some extent, during a single invocation of rebalance we may actually
perform a few gather & assign cycles - but of course once any one of
those cycles reassigns a replica of a part - it can't move another
gather another replica of that part until min_part_hours has passed (or
the next rebalance if min_part_hours is zero).

Most of the time we mark parts as moved when we gather, but during
initial placement we do it during reassign.  This has the effect of
marking every part as moved during the first gather & assign cycle in
rebalance.  We could investigate if special case handling for initial
placement might lead to better initial assignments - but for now this
change just removes a special case for min_part_hours 0 rings that was
left over from the related change.

Also drive-by optimization to free some memory in the part move bitmap
as soon as we're done with it.

With this patch ngs starts supporting attaching of trunk port to
baremetal server. Only VLAN Neutron network is supported.

There are two ways to configure trunk port:

 * C1: When segmentation details for trunk ports are inherited from
   Neutron network. VLAN translation support is not required.
   Added implementation for cisco, arista, OVS on Linux.

 * C2: When user set segmentation details for trunk port explicitly.
   Switch should support VLAN translation for this case.
   Implement only for OVS on Linux, experimental.

NetmikoSwitch.plug_port_to_network() is deprecated. New bind_port()
should be used instead.

New switch config option: vlan_translation_supported was introduced.
This option defines if switch support vlan translation which affect
the way how trunk is configured.

Unlike Python, Java does not have a log appender that works with

This has caused a lot of problems debugging SDaemon. Not to mention
it does not allow to monitor per storlet resource usage for billing.

This patch fixes the problem by using a small JNI class that wraps
the ""C"" runtime syslog library. And so we replace sl4j with syslog

This patch makes in-band RAID clean steps configurable
in the CONF file.  Even though claiming RAID for cleaning
needs other issues to be solved, making the priority of the
these clean step configurable helps someone who has homogenous
hardware all of which support RAID.

It adds two new CONF variables [agent]create_raid_config_priority
and [agent]delete_raid_config_priority which defines priorities
for these in-band steps.  It also marks the feature as experimental
in the description of CONF variables.

** Work In Progress **

Make it so that individual items of object sysmeta
can be updated with a fast-POST request (unlike user
metadata which is replaced as a whole).

There is a probe test that simulates sysmeta merge during
POST and rsync replication after object server 'failure':

nosetests test/probe/test_object_metadata_replication.py:Test.test_updatable_sysmeta

Changes:

- With fast POST, read existing sysmeta, update individual items
and write merged results to new meta file

- To cope with concurrent POSTs and replicated meta files, only
delete meta files when content has been read/merged/written
to new meta file

- Read all meta files when opening diskfile, so after replication
sysmeta is consistent across cluster

- This can result in multiple meta files after
failure conditions/replication with rsync, so merge during
replication too.

- Meta files with same timestamp could have different content
on different servers due to failures, so append md5 hash to
meta file name (yuk)

Work still left to do includes:

- prevent user meta being wiped when sysmeta is POSTed (introduce
X-Preserve-User-Meta header?)

- find a better (more concise) meta file naming scheme

- ssync

- more tests needed

From time to time DIB fails with errors like:

Nevertheless it is later mostly impossible to get the
reason why this failed.

This patch adds a function that gives better / more
debug information when an umount fails.

Remark for Ubuntu Trusty: this fails if the '-fl' is not
used for umounting.  Therefore the current (old) behavior for
this distribution is still in place.

In some cases the dragonflow-dsvm-fullstack-etcd-zmq failed on the
test_reconnect_of_controller check. This was because we did not allow
sufficient time for the controller to reconnect if the host was very
busy and/or the VM was slow.
Allowing double the time resolved the issue.

The template loading code was extracted from the TemplateData class and
placed in separate files, to allow future support of per-version loading
(i.e. different loaders for different template versions).
No real change was done in the code, it  was just split to separate files.

The changes:
* Separate the loading logic from the data
* Split the template loading to specific loaders: template, scenario and equivalences

In compute APIs, they have their schemas in the
independent directory (nova/api/openstack/compute/schemas).
Placement APIs should be like that as well.

This patch separates API schemas to an independent directory
(nova/api/openstack/placement/schemas)
from nova/api/openstack/placement/handlers/inventory.py.

Subsequent patches will move schemas of other handlers.

Move the playbooks/inventory folder, group_vars, and host_vars to
inventory/ in the root of the OpenStack-Ansible repo. This helps better
organize the repo structure since playbooks/ will now only contain
playbooks, shared task files, and included repo package var files.

group_vars and host_vars are moved alongside the inventory since that's
the default place that Ansible expects those folders and to help better
prepare for Ansible 2.4 where multiple inventories can be loaded,
automatically including relative group and host var files.

Effected docs, scripts, and variables have been updated with the new
paths.
