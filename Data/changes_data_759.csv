Currently the profile is hardcoded to test.

In oslo.messaging, we have some packages that are not co-installable.
(qpidd and rabbitmq-server due to a port conflict).

We plan to use tools/test-setup.sh to install only the required one
depending on the tox target that will be run.

In that script we could put all the apt-get/yum commands we need.
But it would be much simpler to use bindep.txt profile and just run:

BINDEP_PROFILE=amqp1 /usr/local/jenkins/slave_scripts/install-distro-packages.sh

instead of copy/pasting all the package installation commands.

This change adds support of BINDEP_PROFILE envvars to be able to reuse
the install-distro-packages.sh scripts.

When config options in different projects use IPOpt as the opt's
type, it restricts operators to only IP addresses.
When the opt is set to HostnameOpt type, currently even an
incomplete or invalid IP passes as a valid hostname. Also, currently
HostnameOpt does not make sure that there is a presense of at least one
non-numeric character in the provided host name.

According to RFC 1123, (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123),
a valid host name can never have the dotted-decimal form #.#.#.#,
since at least the highest-level component label will be alphabetic.

This patch fixes the existing Hostname Opt to abide by the stated RFC
and also adds a new opt type that would enable operators to provide
either a hostname or an IP and at the same time perform checks on
both IPOpt type and HostnameOpt type, by setting opt type to
""HostAddressOpt"" type. This would ensure that an invalid IP does
not pass as a valid hostname and at the same time retains the rules
required to be followed for the validation of an acceptable hostname.

up and cleans things up. Use -{node} more aggressively in jobs so that

This cleans up a small number of straggler heat jobs to run on Xenial.
This affect changes to branches >= newton. Jobs against older branches
continue to run on Trusty.

This also updates the identity v3 only jobs to run against xenial
beacuse this job wasn't passing until recently there is little reason to
run it on trusty and older branches.

Versioned Objects in Swift now use a middleware that is added to the
pipeline instead of the ""allow_versions"" in the container config. These
have 2 different Headers, so to prevent ""X-Versions-Location"" from not
working the ""allow_versions"" in the container config is left in place.

This patch adds the middleware by default and sets the Versioned Objects
support to be on. This is the upstream default and the deployer would
still need to set the ""X-History-Location"" header on a container to
utilise the feature.

When calling list_role_assignment and including the ""include_names""
parameter, it would return the domain name and ID for each party
except for roles.

This will return the domain name and id for roles when the parameter
is included, if the role has a domain.

Added tests for roles with domains at manager and API level.

This patch eliminates the following methods in L3 DVR DB
and converts the necessary logic into callbacks:

* _create_router_db
* _update_router_db

There should be no functional difference between the two.
However, this will get us closer to completely eliminating
the inheritance approach for the DVR DB and we can then move
all DVR specific logic into its service provider driver.

This patch had to fix some of the L3HA unit tests that
were instantiating both the regular L3 service plugin as
well as a custom test plugin for L3 operations.

Additionally, to ensure correct ordering of the flag
setting for 'distributed' and the verification of
user-provided flags by the L3 flavor framework, the
L3 flavor framework now subscribed to a BEFORE_CREATE
event that provides the API request before it's mutated
by the DVR code.

This is for supporting ISA-L cauchy based matrix. The difference
from isa_l_rs_vand is only the matrix to use the encode/decode calculation.

As a known issue, isa_l_rs_vand backend has constraint for the
combinations of the available fragment to be able to decode/reconstuct.
(See related change in detail)

To avoid the constraint, this patch adds another isa-l backend to use
cauchy matrix and keep the backward compatibility, this is in
another isa_l_rs_cauchy namespace.

For implementation consieration, the code is almost same except the matrix
generation fucntion so that this patch makes isa_l_common.c file for
gathering common fucntions like init/encode/decode/reconstruct. And then the
common init funciton takes an extra args ""gen_matrix_func_name"" for entry
point to load the fucntion by dlsym from isa-l .so file.

cryptography embeds some data structures and function signatures from
openssl in its source code. One of these changed in a recent openssl
security release. The result of this is that it is not possible to
build python-cryptography<1.2.3 against the latest security patch of
openssl. We're pinning it to 1.1.2 for liberty, which is affected.

The issue is described here:
https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/2750

There are no 1.1.X releases after 1.1.2. I have confirmed that 1.2.3
is buildable, but 1.2.2 is not, so 1.2.3 is the minimum supportable
version.

The cffi bump to 1.5.2 is a dependency, as cryptography 1.2.3 requires
def_extern from cffi, which was not available in 1.3.1.

With respect to Section-4 of [1], the following patch adds
a function to compress the extended IPv6 address passed to
the neutron server to its canonical form. This allows
compressed IPv6 addresses to be stored and remove any
leading zeroes in the IPv6 addresses.

Non-canonical IPv6 address formatted inputs wont be blocked,
but the addresses would be normalized to canonical formats.

Hacking 0.13.0 was recently released [1][2] and contains
a backwards compatible (new) feature [3] we'd like to leverage.
As the bump from hacking 0.12.0 to 0.13.0 is only this optional
new feature (no new hacking checks), projects don't need to
move up to 0.13.0 so only the upper constraint is bumped for
those who do.

This patsh first extracts the installation of binary/Python dependencies

separate scripts ""install-deps.sh"" and ""install-ansible-source.sh"".

It also adds a third script ""install-ansible-pip.sh"" that is called when

Instead of using a specific network interface name, thi fix
fetch all ethernet mac addresses. Then uses this list of
mac addresses to do a check if any entries in the list
match any of the values in NetConfigDataLookup for a node.
If there is a match, the /etc/os-net-config/mapping.yaml
file for the node will be written.

This fix removes the hard coded interface name 'eth0' used
to get a mac address as identifyer for the specific node

would have failed on most hardware because of ""consistent
network device names"".

This addresses 3 races in image cache:

1. Absent any locking, if the clean job took a very long time to run,
   it was possible for multiple instances of the job to run
   concurrently on the same host. As the job uses global state, this
   will certainly break.

2. When using shared storage, it was possible for a compute host to be
   brought up and create an instance which uses an existing backing
   image before the image cache manager runs for the first time. As
   we only run register_storage_use when the image cache manager runs,
   this means another host running the image cache manager on the same
   storage will not be aware of our instance when choosing which
   images to reap.

3. When using shared storage, it was possible for the image cache
   manager to run concurrently on different hosts. This is complex to
   reason about, and almost certainly fraught with bugs.

(2) and (3) are likely both mitigated if not practically resolved by
change I376cc951. However, a clean lock makes this code much simpler
to reason about.

This does not make this code race free, because we still race with
instance create. Change I376cc951 significantly reduces, but does not
eliminate that race window.

instance is rebuilt on the new compute with the new size and no local

Add LVM support functions needed to support resizing LVM backed

resize_volume(), and get_volume_vg().

Add detection and removal of all LVM disks associated with the instance

This is a workaround to libvirt issue described here:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1372944. The problem is that
libvirt dosn't update the mac address of the netdevice, instead it uses
netlink to configure the mac address of the VF. For macvtap to work
libvirt should set the mac address on the VF net device and using
netlink. Until this is fixed we should set both of them in nova.

the case an implementation is broken and emits more than 1 event when
running watchers, the tests would not see the difference.

This patch makes sure nothing is broken.

There's a lot of methods implementing the common watcher tools that are
inherited from all drivers whereas there is no need for that. The mixin
is actually not correctly designed, as it mixes the hooks and the cache

This splits out the common implementation into its common class that can
be inherited to implement this model of driver.

The important test is the following one, which tests that we prevent
thundering herds. The test that we _have_ one is subject to a race
condition where the mocks execute so quickly that we don't herd even
without the protection. But that's ok - it's ok for a herd to
accidentally not happen. So remove the test which is just false-negative
noise.

This patch is the first step in enabling SR/IOV to be supported

cause problems where 'sriovnicswitch' is removed from the list

could be added to any environment file, but thought it best to
add in separately as it's somewhat uncommon and we need a
placeholder for Nova PCI device lists.

All cache operations and dnsmasq process operations
are scoped to a network ID so we can always safely
perform concurrent actions on different network IDs.
This patch adjusts the DHCP agent to lock based on
network ID rather than having a global lock for every
operation.

sync_state calls are still protected with a reader/writer
lock to ensure that when sync_state needs to run, all
other operations are blocked.

Previously the ctrl plane VIP would default to 'br-ex' which in non-vlan
deployments ends up being the wrong interface.  The public VIP interface
was also defaulted to 'br-ex' which would be incorrect for vlan based
deployments.  Since a user has already given the nic template (and in
most cases the subnet that corresponds to the nic) the installer should
be able to figure out which interface the public/control vip should be
on.

These changes enable that type of auto-detection, unless a user
explicitly overrides the heat parameters for ControlVirtualInterface and
PublicVirtualInterface.  Also removes calling keepalived from haproxy
now that the services are composed separately on the Controller role.

In python3, str is already represents unicode data. The current code
called oslo.utils safe_encode irrespective of incoming message encoding
and encoded it to 'utf-8', however that resolves to a byte string.

Since the syslog module expects a message of type unicode[1]. We don't
need to encode if python3 is being used, since the string representation
is sequence of unicode codepoints by default.

While defaulting use_stderr to True might be a useful development
default, it is not useful for operators. Operators using systemd,
upstart, or any of these kinds of services, will find that if they
specify --log-file they will have two copies of the same logs on their
disk:

- one in the service log (e.g., /var/log/upstart)
- one in the log file they specify with --log-file

Instead of operators having to disable stderr log in every
configuration, we should just default it to False here.

This patch finishes the rework of murano-dashboard assets by
reorganizing css files:
* now they are scss files to use the @import statement;
* each page's set to dedicated css rules is an @import nested under
  that page body-id, which is set in the corresponding template;
* css rules which do not have explicit use are @imported under
  #murano-common id which is set for all non-specific templates;
* specific templates still have all the css rules from 'common' murano
  set.

The above solution is not ideal, but would allow to use a single css
file for murano-dashboard, and remove custom css rules at some point
in future.

The two REST APIs ``os-getConsoleOutput`` and ``os-getSerialConsole`` can
now be satisfied at the same time. This is valid for any combination of:
* char device element: ""console"", ""serial""

will be done in the tcp device.

They were deprecated in Newton. This patch cleans them up.

Note: it does not mean that the features will not work anymore. On the
contrary, now API will consistently sort and paginate for plugins that
honour the relevant sorting/pagination parameters.

Note2: base resource controller still allows to pass
allow_pagination=False and allow_sorting=False parameters to disable the
features if a registered plugin does not support the features yet.

In Identity->Users, if multidomain support is enabled and no domain
context has been explicitly selected, attempting to list the users will
make Keystone return a 401 Unauthorized error, which in turn results
in Horizon assuming that the token expired and logging out the user.

Because it's not possible to distinguish that error from a legitimate
token expiry (it should probably be 403 Forbidden instead), I'm adding
a check before we call Keystone, and use the default domain for the
context if none was selected by the user.

In addition, all the tests assumed that no context is selected, and only
worked because they mocked the Keystone calls (real Keystone returns an
error in that case). So I had to make the tests use a default domain
instead.

The landing of [1] introduced an issue whereupon local
checks were registered after the options had already been
populated with pep8 checks (see patch); resulting in the
checks not running. Instead, the checks can be ""refreshed""
by getting them from a pep8 StyleGuide and updating on
the options.

A unit test is also included that verifies the options are updated
with the latest checks from a pep8 StyleGuide object.

This change was in my workspace/testing for [1], but somehow
was left out of the patch commit. I'm still investigating what
happened and am very humbled.

If reviewers don't agree to this patch, then we should revert

For drivers that implement update_access always through recovery
mode, access rules previously set to read-only were being reset
to read-write when the Data Service was adding/removing its access
rule.

Fixed it by integrating the logic that casts DB rules to read-only
into access helper class.

For OpenStack Newton, the external network bridge configuration
default switched from br-ex to '' inline with the preferred
method of configuring external networks using provider networks
via the l2 agent (instead of the l3 agent).

This had the side effect of breaking support for legacy style
networking.

Set:

  external_network_bridge = br-ex

in the event that new style external networking is not being used
to preserve backwards compatibility for now.

Note that this option will be removed in Ocata, so environments
need to upgrade to the preferred method of external networking in
order to stay supported.

This patch tries to document and test the following invariant that
should apply for all groups in the environment:

    A group should have either child groups, or hosts, not both.

Tests are introduced to confirm and enforce this behavior, based on the
reported failing configuration.

A new function, _check_group_branches, is added which will detect a
failing scenario before code that uses it is executed. If a conflict is
found, a GroupConflict exception will be raised indicating why.

The _check_group_branches function was placed before the physical skel
loading because the problem occurs during that phase; placing this in
the _check_config_settings function would be checking after the error's
already been raised.

A note was also added to _parse_belongs_to to communicate it's implicit
dependence on state as checked by _check_group_branches.

There are multiple instance action notifications where the only
way to test notification sample is to wait for the notfication
to arrive as there is no indication on the REST API that the
certain action has been finished.

Until now the only way to implement such test was to poll the
fake_notifier.VERSIONED_NOTIFICATIONS list to see if the notification
is arrived.

This patch adds a polling free solution based on threading.Event

And also replace 'do' with 'to' in title.

The current existing agent erases already set ovsdb managers
entries. In some use cases, cloud admin sets ovsdb managers.
eg, for SDN controllers or monitoring purpose. Neutron agent
shouldn't unconditionally erase the existing ovsdb managers.

This patch implements a new api add_manager (along with
get_manager and remove_manager) to the ovsdb api which will
allow us to configure a manager on a switch without overriding
the existing managers.

The only reason we need newer openvswitch is following fix [1] for
user-space part of openvswitch. This patch fixes our
test_install_flood_to_tun tests.

Current 2.6 branch has issues with ovsdb where connection with native
interface is getting lost and functional job gets stuck. To mitigate
that, this patch switches back to OVS 2.5.1 version for functional jobs,
compiling only user-space part as OVS 2.5.1 kernel modules are not
supported by Xenial.

Fullstack job remains running with 2.6 because the job needs OVS kernel patch
for local VXLAN tunneling.

Stop running these jobs on trusty as they are restricted to >= newton
already. Run them on Xenial as >= newton should run on Xenial.

The only reason we need newer openvswitch is following fix [1] for
user-space part of openvswitch. This patch fixes our
test_install_flood_to_tun tests.

Current 2.6 branch has issues with ovsdb where connection with native
interface is getting lost and functional job gets stuck. To mitigate
that, this patch switches back to OVS 2.5.1 version for functional jobs,
compiling only user-space part as OVS 2.5.1 kernel modules are not
supported by Xenial.

Fullstack job remains running with 2.6 because the job needs OVS kernel patch
for local VXLAN tunneling.

The periodic job for this was already running on Xenial. Continue the
transition and run the experimental job on Xenial for changes against
branches >= newton. Older branches will run on trusty.
