OpenShift deployed by TripleO support has been removed in a downstream
version of Stein which make the upstream support difficult to maintain.
OpenShift can be deployed using OpenShift-Ansible and
users who desire to deploy OpenShift 3.11 onto bare metal nodes can
still do so using openshift-ansible directly. The provisioning of
the Operating System on baremetal can be done with OpenStack Ironic on
the Overcloud or also can be done with deployed-servers, achieving the
same result.

Our tools noticed that keystone links to
https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/identity-domain-specific-config.html
which does not exist anymore.

The page was removed but the link to it was not changed. Replace this
and similar links with internal links that will work even if files are
moved - and can be verified, thus sphinx will error in case of broken
targets.

These changes include a few other fixes for broken keystone links, e.g.
to renamed anchors.

For the include files in admin/configuration.rst and
admin/federation/configure_federation.rst: Rename them to *inc.
The files were
published twice (as separate files and on this page) and thus
referencing failed. Renaming avoids this.

Also, put doctree outside of html tree so that it does not get
published.

Previously this had no timeout, which meant that the replicator might
hang and fail to make progress indefinitely while trying to receive
shard ranges.

While we're at it, only call get_shard_ranges when the remote indicates
that it has shard ranges for us to sync -- this reduces the number of
requests necessary to bring unsharded replicas in sync.

At present, 'pycodestyle' feeds the following string into the 'tokenizer'
library:

    [""'This is the the best comment'""]

(note the added quotes because this isn't valid Python otherwise)

On previous versions of Python, this tokenizer would parse the string like so:

  (3, ""'This is the the best comment'"", (1, 0), (1, 30), ""'This is the the best comment'"")
  (0, '', (2, 0), (2, 0), '')

where (3 = 'STRING', 0 = 'ENDMARKER')

However, with the fix [1] backported to recent versions of Python, this now
resolves to:

  (3, ""'This is the the best comment'"", (1, 0), (1, 30), ""'This is the the best comment'"")
  (4, '', (1, 30), (1, 31), '')
  (0, '', (2, 0), (2, 0), '')

where (3 = 'STRING', 4 = 'NEWLINE', 0 = 'ENDMARKER')

Typically, 'pycodestyle' will run physical line checks on each line as it
parses the token:

  https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/blob/2.5.0/pycodestyle.py#L2036

For the former case above, the line doesn't include a newline which
means we never parse a 'NEWLINE' token with a logical line (the fifth
element of the token tuple) corresponding to our full line. This means
we don't here but that wasn't an issue previously since there's a
fallthrough case that handled tokens remaining at the end of the parse:

  https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/blob/2.5.0/pycodestyle.py#L2114-L2116

Unfortunately, because we now have an additional newline character to
parse, one that's on a separate line to our test string no less, we run
logical checks on it:

  https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/blob/2.5.0/pycodestyle.py#L2105-L2107

This is an issue since the logical check wipes stored tokens meaning
we've nothing to check when we get to the fallthrough case:

  https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/blob/2.5.0/pycodestyle.py#L2012

This fixes changes things so that a newline is included (and also adds
quotes so it's valid Python, but that's mostly unrelated). This means we
end up with the following instead:

  [""'This is the the best comment'\n""]

On both Python without the bugfix and with it, this parses as:

  (3, ""'This is the the best comment'"", (1, 0), (1, 30), ""'This is the the best comment'\n"")
  (4, '\n', (1, 30), (1, 31), ""'This is the the best comment'\n"")
  (0, '', (2, 0), (2, 0), '')

where (3 = 'STRING', 4 = 'NEWLINE', 0 = 'ENDMARKER')

Which triggers things in 'pycodestyle' correctly.

  https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/blob/2.5.0/pycodestyle.py#L2044-L2046

This isn't _really_ a fix since there's clearly still a bug in either
'pycodestyle' or Python (I think the latter, since it's adding a newline
to a file that explicitly doesn't have one), but the chances of us
hitting this bug in practice are rather low - you'd need to make a
mistake on the very last line of a file without a newline at the end
which is something Vim, for example, won't even let you do without
setting special flags - and therefore it can be reasonably ignored.

Profiling revealed that copying AllocationRequestResource in
_consolidate_allocation_requests was expensive.

As an optimization, this patch adds logic to only do that copy when it's
necessary.

And it's only necessary for an ARR whose resource class was requested
from multiple groups, when group_policy=none. In that case, we're
constructing multiple results with the same ARR. For example, consider a
host with two PFs with VF inventory. A request like:

 ?resources1=VF:1
 &resources2=VF:1
 &group_policy=none

...will yield results like:

(1) PF1{VF:1},PF2{VF:1}
(2) PF1{VF:2}
(3) PF2{VF:2}

The AllocationRequestResource representing PF1{VF:1} gets used in both
result (1) and result (2). When producing result (2), we add the
AllocationRequestResource.amountZ together. If we were reusing the same
ARR instance from result (1), result (1) would end up looking like:

(1) PF1{VF:2},PF2{VF:1}

...which is wrong. So we have to do the copy.

With group_policy=isolate, or if we've only requested the resource class
from one group, we're only using that ARR once in the results, so we can
just use it without copying.

The server fault ""message"" is always shown in the API
server response, regardless of policy or user role.

The fault ""details"" are only shown to users with the
admin role when the fault code is 500.

The problem with this is for non-nova exceptions, the
fault message is a string-ified version of the exception
(see nova.compute.utils.exception_to_dict) which can
contain sensitive information which the non-admin owner
of the server can see.

This change adds a functional test to recreate the issue
and a change to exception_to_dict which for the non-nova
case changes the fault message by simply storing the
exception type class name. Admins can still see the fault
traceback in the ""details"" key of the fault dict in the
server API response. Note that _get_fault_details is
changed so that the details also includes the exception
value which is what used to be in the fault message for
non-nova exceptions. This is necessary so admins can still
get the exception message with the traceback details.

Note that nova exceptions with a %(reason)s replacement
variable could potentially be leaking sensitive details as
well but those would need to be cleaned up on a case-by-case
basis since we don't want to change the behavior of all
fault messages otherwise users might not see information
like NoValidHost when their server goes to ERROR status
during scheduling.

SecurityImpact: This change contains a fix for CVE-2019-14433.

Change Icddbe4760eaff30e4e13c1e8d3d5d3f489dac3c4 was intended for the
API service to check all cells for the minimum nova-compute service
version when [upgrade_levels]/compute=auto.

That worked in the gate with devstack because we don't configure
nova-compute with access to the database and run nova-compute with
a separate nova-cpu.conf so even if nova-compute is on the same
host as the nova-api service, they aren't using the same config
file (nova-api runs with nova.conf which has access to the API DB
obviously).

The problem is when nova-compute is configured with
[upgrade_levels]/compute=auto and an [api_database]/connection,
there are flows that can try to hit the API database directly
because of the _determine_version_cap method. For example, the
_sync_power_states periodic task trying to stop an instance,
or even simple inter-compute communication over RPC like during
a resize.

This change simply catches the DBNotAllowed exception, logs a more
useful error message, and re-raises the exception. In addition,
the config help for the [api_database] group and ""configuration""
option specifically are updated to mention they should not be set
on the nova-compute service.

There are only four valid values for the migration_type filter
when listing migrations so let's document them for the request
parameter. Note that the API jsonschema validation does not
restrict the values since the filter parameter pre-dated jsonschema
validation for query parameters. Specifying an invalid value would
just result in no results from the DB query.

Change I64fa5fde35f9b9f2e8aa4977eb2c253ffc6aee99 on the service side
removed all support for pool group in a backwards incompatible way,
causing any client calls that include it to fail. This is causing
functional test failures for python-zaqarclient now and is preventing
any patches from passing gate checks.

This patch drops support in the client. The next release will need to be
a major one to indicate there was a backwards incompatible change
included.

Also needed to update the Sphinx doc requirement to match current global
requirements since that is also causing a blocking failure in the gate.

Also needed to uncap jsonschema to match current global requirements.

In Pike, we added a UUID field to services and during an upgrade from
Ocata => Pike, when instances are accessed joined with their associated
services, we generate a UUID for the services on-the-fly.

This causes a problem in the scenario where an operator upgrades their
cluster and has old, deleted services with hostnames matching existing
services associated with instances. When we go to generate the service
UUID for the old, deleted service, we hit a ServiceTooOld exception.

This addresses the problem by not bothering to generate a UUID for a
deleted service. One alternative would be to exclude deleted services
when we join the 'instances' and 'services' tables, but I'm not sure
whether that approach might cause unintended effects where service
information that used to be viewable for instances becomes hidden.

Unlike docker with podman you can't mount a host directory
that does not exist. We did some work as part of bug 1799638
take care of this for reboots. However, we need it to be created
for fresh installations, as nodes are not necessarily rebooted
after installing paunch. The real issue without reboots did not
surface before the next patch in this series, as we were using
cni0 bridge network for some containers and that resulted in
namespace being created and the directory existing for
neutron_dhcp and neutron_l3 containers in step 4 to mount them.

This patch creates/removes a temp namespace in host_prep_tasks
to ensure that the directory exists.

This attempts to recreate the following scenario:

1) boot instance on ocata host where the compute service
   does not have a uuid
2) migrate instance
3) delete the ocata service (thus deleting the compute node)
4) start compute service with the same name
5) migrate instance to newly-created compute node
6) upgrade to pike where services.uuid data migration happens
7) list instances as admin to join on the services table

The failure occurs when listing instances because the deleted
service with the same name as the compute host that the instance
is running on gets pulled from the DB and the Service object
attempts to set a uuid on it, which fails since it's not using
a read_deleted=""yes"" context.

While working on this, the service_get_all_by_binary DB API
method had to be fixed to not hard-code read_deleted=""no"" since
the test needs to be able to read deleted services, which it can
control via its own context object (note that
RequestContext.read_deleted already defaults to ""no"" so the
hard-coding in the DB API is unnecessarily restrictive).

Change I7b8622b178d5043ed1556d7bdceaf60f47e5ac80 started deleting the
compute node resource provider associated with a compute node when
deleting a nova-compute service. However, it would only delete the
first compute node associated with the service which means for an
ironic compute service that is managing multiple nodes, the resource
providers were not cleaned up in placement. This fixes the issue by
iterating all the compute nodes and cleaning up their providers.
Note this could be potentially a lot of nodes, but we don't really
have many good options here but to iterate them and clean them up
one at a time.

Note that this is best-effort but because of how the
SchedulerReportClient.delete_resource_provider method ignores
ResourceProviderInUse errors, and we could have stale allocations
on the host for which delete_resource_provider is not accounting,
namely allocations from evacuated instances (or incomplete migrations
though you can't migrate baremetal instances today), we could still
delete the compute service and orphan those in-use providers. That,
however, is no worse than before this change where we did not try
to cleanup all providers. The issue described above is being tracked
with bug 1829479 and will be dealt with separately.

This patch covers the automation of the undercloud's operating
system upgrade using Leapp.
It includes a new option for Infrared --undercloud_os_upgrade
that will allow us to run only the specific bits to upgrade the
undercloud's OS. The node subscription needs to be done before
running this set of tasks, otherwise it will fail.

Before running leapp it's needed to clean up all the RHEL7
packages and some other packages which conflict with leapp, like
is the case of rhos-release.

Once the whole leapp upgrade and reboot has been performed, the
undercloud might be unsubscribed if desired by setting the
leapp_unregister variable.

Due to the incompatibility of the python2 binary interpreter and
RHEL8, we also need to set the ansible_python_interpreter variable
at playbook level inside infrared-plugin/main.yml.

The server fault ""message"" is always shown in the API
server response, regardless of policy or user role.

The fault ""details"" are only shown to users with the
admin role when the fault code is 500.

The problem with this is for non-nova exceptions, the
fault message is a string-ified version of the exception
(see nova.compute.utils.exception_to_dict) which can
contain sensitive information which the non-admin owner
of the server can see.

This change adds a functional test to recreate the issue
and a change to exception_to_dict which for the non-nova
case changes the fault message by simply storing the
exception type class name. Admins can still see the fault
traceback in the ""details"" key of the fault dict in the
server API response. Note that _get_fault_details is
changed so that the details also includes the exception
value which is what used to be in the fault message for
non-nova exceptions. This is necessary so admins can still
get the exception message with the traceback details.

Note that nova exceptions with a %(reason)s replacement
variable could potentially be leaking sensitive details as
well but those would need to be cleaned up on a case-by-case
basis since we don't want to change the behavior of all
fault messages otherwise users might not see information
like NoValidHost when their server goes to ERROR status
during scheduling.

SecurityImpact: This change contains a fix for CVE-2019-14433.

If TLS isn't enabled, Augeas won't create tripleo.cnf but Docker will
create the file itself while mount binding it into the container.
With podman, the files/dirs that don't exist aren't created (probably

Prior to this patch there was a condition when no
host_available was true and an exception would get
raised without first cleaning up the instance.
This causes instances to get indefinitely stuck in
a scheduling state.

This patch fixes this by calling the clean up function
and then exits build_instances using a return statement.

to show this fixes the bug.

Previously attempts to remove the shelved snapshot of an unshelved
instance when using the rbd backends for both Nova and Glance would
fail. This was due to the instance disk being cloned from and still
referencing the shelved snapshot image in Glance, blocking any attempt
to remove this image later in the unshelve process.

After much debate this change attempts to fix this issue by flattening
the instance disk while the instance is being spawned as part of an
unshelve. For the rbd imagebackend this removes any reference to the
shelved snapshot in Glance allowing this image to be removed. For all
other imagebackends the call to flatten the image is currently a no-op.

This adds a functional regression recreate test for
bug 1837955 which was introduced with change
Iae904afb6cb4fcea8bb27741d774ffbe986a5fb4 in the Queens
release.

In this scenario, the primary (and potentially alternate)
hosts for a server build fail and reschedule to conductor.
Eventually all alternate hosts are exhausted and specifically
trying to claim allocations against the alternates fails,
probably because between the time of initial scheduling and
rescheduling something else took up the spare capacity on the
alternate host.

When this happens, MaxRetriesExceeded is raised but the
instance is stuck in BUILD status rather than set to ERROR
status with a fault message.

NOTE(mriedem): In this backport the test is changed slighty
since change Iea283322124cb35fc0bc6d25f35548621e8c8c2f is not
in Queens so ProviderUsageBaseTestCase is still in test_servers.py.

When trying to delete host that can be found in host_mappings
but not in compute_nodes, current cellv2 delete_host will throw
an exception but does not really handle it.

This patch tries to handle this exception and allow the delete
operation to continue since it shows the host has gone anyway.

python2 for trusty and python3 for everything later, or trusty is

This patchset adds support for performing a snap installation of LXD on
the nova-compute host that the LXD subordinate is added to.
There a corresponding changes in the nova-compute charm and in the
nova-lxd plugin for nova.  The reason is because some directories change
depending on whether LXD is snap-installed or not, and in the case of
nova-lxd, the location of the console.log.

Essentially, the charm tries to run a `lxc list` to verify that the LXD
configuration is complete (from the LXD subordinate charm).  However,
when LXD is snap installed, the binary and location of its config
changes.  This patchset updates the nova-compute charm with this
information.

The notification sample test for unshelve waits for the instance to
reach ACTIVE state and then asserts if unshelve.end notification is
emitted properly. However the instance.vm_state is set to ACTIVE earlier[1]
than emitting the unshelve.end notification[2]. This can cause two
different test case failure.

1) _test_unshelve_server() fails with no ushelve.end notification
received.

2) _test_shelve_and_shelve_offload_server() also has a unshelve action
at the end and that test step also only waits for the the ACTIVE state.
So the unshelve.end notification from the end of
_test_shelve_and_shelve_offload_server() can bleed into the
_test_unshelve_server() step causing that it receive one more
notifications.

So this patch adds an extra
self._wait_for_notification('instance.unshelve.end') call to each test
step to prevent the instability.

It turns out that when Python runs copy.copy on an object it does
a lot of unnecessary work that can be avoided by implementing a
__copy__ method that essentially does a clone(), creating a new
object with the same values. This is considered the idiomatic form
of clone.

That unnecessary work shows up quite significantly in the
_consolidate_allocation_requests method in allocation_candidate.py where
AllocationRequestResource objects get copied, a lot. The use of __copy__
more than halves the time consumed by _consolidate_allocation_requests.

There is another copy.copy, in _alloc_candidates_single_provider in the
same file, this time copying AllocationRequest objects. This is only
done when a shared provider is involved, and we haven't been doing scale
testing for those (yet) but since we're in that domain I've gone ahead
and pre-emptively added a __copy__ to that object too, to prepare for
the eventual work of many shared disks.

Since monasca-ui was only released once last cycle AND it has not
yet been released this cycle yet either, we propose to change it to the
cycle-with-rc model which is better for deliverables that do a single
release per cycle.

There are three options for responding:

1) If you know you will only do one release this cycle, +1.
2) If you know you will do more than one, please release now and -1
this change.
3) If you have no idea when you will release, please please please
propose one BEFORE rc1 and -1 this change.

This patch squaches two commits:

1) Do not modify passed by reference variables in mechanism_driver

Test test_update_port_with_empty_data [0] from TestOVNMechanismDriverPortsV2
class in neutron is runned agains:
neutron.tests.unit.plugins.ml2.drivers.mechanism_test.TestMechanismDriver
which in fact during update_port_postcommit() does nothing with
the port, only validates it [1].

In networking-ovn this test is runned against real mechanism driver:
networking_ovn.ml2.mech_driver.OVNMechanismDriver. This ends with
little difference - to port dict 'network' information is added
during call of update_port_postcommit(). The port data itself
remains the same.
We shouldn't modify passed by reference variables there. So doing
deepcopy on all provided data.

Here comes also the question if this test inheritance is the
right way.

2) Add mock for _check_for_socket_ready

Recently in new octavia-lib release driver-lib provides
get methods for quering objects by its ids [2].
We need to mock() socket communication in tests, otherwise
all the tests fails blocking CI.

In Pike, we added a UUID field to services and during an upgrade from
Ocata => Pike, when instances are accessed joined with their associated
services, we generate a UUID for the services on-the-fly.

This causes a problem in the scenario where an operator upgrades their
cluster and has old, deleted services with hostnames matching existing
services associated with instances. When we go to generate the service
UUID for the old, deleted service, we hit a ServiceTooOld exception.

This addresses the problem by not bothering to generate a UUID for a
deleted service. One alternative would be to exclude deleted services
when we join the 'instances' and 'services' tables, but I'm not sure
whether that approach might cause unintended effects where service
information that used to be viewable for instances becomes hidden.

The RabbitMQ role supports namespacing the service via the
project_name. For example, if you change the project_name, the
container name and config directory will be renamed accordingly. However
the log folder is currently fixed, even though the service tries to
write to one named after the project_name. This change fixes that.

Whilst you might generally use vhosts, running multiple RabbitMQ
services on a single node is useful at the very least for testing,
or for running 'outward RabbitMQ' on the same node.

This change is part of the work to support Cells v2.

Commit a5244d6d44d2b66de27dc77efa7830fa657260be changed the check
order so regular non-dvr ports are checked for agent restarted.
However regular ports may be unbound already, which leads to the
error in the bug description: agent_restarted check is done against
a 'None' agent.
This patch fixed logic back - only check agent_restarted for dvr ports.

This also adds some logging to have a clue why update port up/down fails.

This patch further minimalizes yum-minimal based OSes. It does so by
removing packages not expected on minimal environments, and moving the
doc files delete to run in the end of the image build. Additionally,
package redhat-rpm-config was removed as there's no value in having it
on such minimal environments, and it pulls Perl and its subpackages.

linux-firmware and linux-firmware-whence (meta package for mostly iwl
firmwares) packages account for approx. 289 M install size on a F30
system, and linux-firmware for approx. 176 M on CentOS 7. Users needing
these firmwares are eventually baremetal users and are not looking for a
very minimal operating system base install like virtual image users are.
Thus, a non-minimal OS element is better suited for them. Alternatively,
it could be later considered, and if only proven to be required, a
dedicated firmware element.

The server fault ""message"" is always shown in the API
server response, regardless of policy or user role.

The fault ""details"" are only shown to users with the
admin role when the fault code is 500.

The problem with this is for non-nova exceptions, the
fault message is a string-ified version of the exception
(see nova.compute.utils.exception_to_dict) which can
contain sensitive information which the non-admin owner
of the server can see.

This change adds a functional test to recreate the issue
and a change to exception_to_dict which for the non-nova
case changes the fault message by simply storing the
exception type class name. Admins can still see the fault
traceback in the ""details"" key of the fault dict in the
server API response. Note that _get_fault_details is
changed so that the details also includes the exception
value which is what used to be in the fault message for
non-nova exceptions. This is necessary so admins can still
get the exception message with the traceback details.

Note that nova exceptions with a %(reason)s replacement
variable could potentially be leaking sensitive details as
well but those would need to be cleaned up on a case-by-case
basis since we don't want to change the behavior of all
fault messages otherwise users might not see information
like NoValidHost when their server goes to ERROR status
during scheduling.

SecurityImpact: This change contains a fix for CVE-2019-14433.

NOTE(mriedem): The functional test imports change here
because Idaed39629095f86d24a54334c699a26c218c6593 is not
in Rocky so the PlacementFixture comes from nova_fixtures.

Without this patch, if a project is going through a heavy policy
refactor, significant numbers of deprecation warnings are emitted. When
the enforcer is repeated reinitialized, as is the case when unit
testing, the vast amount of logs resulting from the warnings is both
unnecessary and harmful as it impedes log readability and explodes the
size of the logs, thereby causing CI instability as the infrastructure
struggles to process the logs.

This change adds a public attribute to the enforcer object to allow
callers to suppress these logs. This is not exposed as a configuration
option because we do not want to allow operators to suppress these logs,
and the warnings that occur when the enforcer is only reinitialized when
the process is reloaded are not nearly so debilitating as they are
during, e.g., a unit test run when the enforcer is generally
reinitialized for every test.

The Python warnings module allows for setting global attributes to
filter logs, and it might have been useful for the consuming project to
filter these logs at that level rather than modifying the policy
enforcer to turn log emissions on and off. The problem with this
approach is that if the number of deprecations is extreme, as may be the
case during a heavy refactor, the warnings filter can become so
inefficient that the test run can take much longer, causing even further
CI stability as test runs reach timeout limits.

As part of Train community goal 'Support IPv6-Only Deployments and Testing'[1],
Tempest has defined the base job 'devstack-tempest-ipv6' (adding
in Depends-On patch) which will deploy services on IPv6.

This commit adds the new job 'murano-tempest-api-ipv6-only'
run on gate which is derived from 'devstack-tempest-ipv6'.

Verification structure will be:
- 'devstack-IPv6' deploy the service on IPv6
- 'devstack-tempest-ipv6' run will verify the IPv6-only setting and listen address
- 'murano-tempest-api-ipv6-only' will run the tests.

When running a 3-nodes Redis cluster with TLS, we use an intermediate
container redis_tls_proxy for all the encrypted communication between
the redis nodes.

The intermediate container is managed by paunch, so it shouldn't use
the container image tagged :pcmklatest. This tag is a intermediate
tag only meant to be consumed by pacemaker to implement container
update without service disruption. When used in paunch, it causes
the deployment to fail at step 2.

Configure redis_tls_proxy to use heat parameter DockerRedisImage
instead. That is the image meant to be consumed by paunch containers.

This has been manually cherry-picked because the name of the heat
parameter changed between Stein and Master.

When the ResourceTracker creates a new ComputeNode
record, when using the Ironic driver, we can use
the ironic node uuid to set the compute node uuid
which will then also get reflected as the compute
node resource provider uuid in Placement, which
will be a nice link between the three resources
which should be 1:1:1 with each other. This isn't
mandatory nor does it fix any bugs, but it will
be nice for debugging.

When trying to recreate hundreds of instance action
events for scale testing with the FakeDriver, a nice
simple way to do that is by stopping those instances
and starting them again.

However, since power_off/on aren't implemented, once
you ""stop"" them the sync_instance_power_state periodic
task in the compute manager thinks they are still running
on the ""hypervisor"" and will stop them again via the API,
which records yet another instance action and set of
events.

This just toggles the power state bit on the fake instance
in the FakeDriver to make the periodic task do the right
thing.

As a result, we also have more realistic API and
notification samples.

  - Removed default settings enabled after release XYZ that are
    not controlled by the featureset file: e.g. cnf-dl.
  - Removed settings not present in any fs: ssl uc

If using the kayobe --limit <hosts> argument, only those hosts matching
the limit will have an inventory generated for Kolla Ansible. This can
cause problems for Kolla Ansible, even when using a similar limit via
--kolla-limit <hosts>, since it gathers facts for all hosts, and expects
all host variables to be defined.

This change adds a new 'ignore_limit' argument to the playbook running
methods, which allows us to override and ignore the --limit argument
provided by the user, ensuring that we always run these plays.

This attempts to recreate the following scenario:

1) boot instance on ocata host where the compute service
   does not have a uuid
2) migrate instance
3) delete the ocata service (thus deleting the compute node)
4) start compute service with the same name
5) migrate instance to newly-created compute node
6) upgrade to pike where services.uuid data migration happens
7) list instances as admin to join on the services table

The failure occurs when listing instances because the deleted
service with the same name as the compute host that the instance
is running on gets pulled from the DB and the Service object
attempts to set a uuid on it, which fails since it's not using
a read_deleted=""yes"" context.

While working on this, the service_get_all_by_binary DB API
method had to be fixed to not hard-code read_deleted=""no"" since
the test needs to be able to read deleted services, which it can
control via its own context object (note that
RequestContext.read_deleted already defaults to ""no"" so the
hard-coding in the DB API is unnecessarily restrictive).

By the time finish_resize runs on the dest host, the instance
host/node values are already pointing at the dest (they are
set by resize_instance on the source compute before casting to
finish_resize on the dest). If finish_resize fails, the instance
is essentially stuck on the dest host so rather than revert the
allocations (which will drop the new flavor allocations against
the dest host where the instance now lives) we should just drop
the old flavor allocations on the source node resource provider,
which is what this change does.

The functional regression recreate test is updated to show this
working.

Conflicts:
      nova/tests/functional/regressions/test_bug_1825537.py
      nova/tests/functional/test_servers.py

NOTE(mriedem): The functional test conflicts are due to not having
change If6aa37d9b6b48791e070799ab026c816fda4441c in Rocky.
The code fix is also different because we don't have change
I0851e2d54a1fdc82fe3291fb7e286e790f121e92 in Rocky and cannot use
the _delete_allocation_after_move method as documented inline.
This also means we have to deal with migration-based and legacy
tracked allocations (where the source and dest node allocations
are both on the instance consumer). As such, similar logic to
_delete_allocation_after_move is used to try and delete the
migration-based allocations first and failing that, attempt
to cleanup the source node allocations the legacy way by removing
them from the ""doubled up"" allocations created by the scheduler.
Since this is new logic in the backport, a functional test is
added to cover the legacy cleanup flow.

This reverts commit eaa766ee2093c24fd61c61e52f46bdd9ff9e93d2.

The change regressed the behavior of the ImagePropertiesFilter
because existing images with hypervisor_type=QEMU, which would
match what is reported for hypervisor_type in the API for both
qemu/kvm virt_type nodes, will now get filtered out for hosts
where the configured virt_type is kvm.

Note that both the ImagePropertiesFilter docs [1] and
hypervisor_type image property docs [2] mention that for both
qemu and kvm nodes the value to use is qemu since that is the
actual hypervisor.

Presumably the change was made for a deployment with some
hosts configured with virt_type=qemu and other hosts configured
with virt_type=kvm and there were separate images with
hypervisor_type=qemu and hypervisor_type=kvm to match those hosts
for scheduler filter, but as noted this was a regression in
behavior for something that could have been achieved using
host aggregates and the AggregateImagePropertiesIsolation filter.

We could even use traits and a placement request pre-filter these
days for a more modern approach.

Also, since the API continues to report hypervisor_type=QEMU it's
doubly confusing for operators to have to configure their images
to use hypervisor_type=kvm (despite the docs).

And finally, any existing instances which have hypervisor_type=qemu
embedded in their RequestSpec can no longer be migrated to kvm
hosts without manually fixing the entries in the request_specs
table in the API DB.

Note that this is not a clean revert because of change
I5d95bd50279a6bf903a5793ad5f3ae9d06f085f4 made in Stein.

Prior to this patch there was a condition when no
host_available was true and an exception would get
raised without first cleaning up the instance.
This causes instances to get indefinitely stuck in
a scheduling state.

This patch fixes this by calling the clean up function
and then exits build_instances using a return statement.

The related functional regression recreate test is updated
to show this fixes the bug.

NOTE(mriedem): There are three changes in this backport. First,
since bug 1819460 and change I78fc2312274471a7bd85a263de12cc5a0b19fd10
do not apply to Rocky, _cleanup_when_reschedule_fails is added here.
Second, the test_bug_1837955 setUp needed to stub notifications
since change I017d1a31139c9300642dd706eadc265f7c954ca8 is not
in Rocky to do that in ProviderUsageBaseTestCase. Third, the unit
test is changed to mock _set_vm_state_and_notify since
change Ibfb0a6db5920d921c4fc7cabf3f4d2838ea7f421 is not in Rocky
for compute utils to call notify_about_compute_task_error.

This adds a functional regression recreate test for
bug 1837955 which was introduced with change
Iae904afb6cb4fcea8bb27741d774ffbe986a5fb4 in the Queens
release.

In this scenario, the primary (and potentially alternate)
hosts for a server build fail and reschedule to conductor.
Eventually all alternate hosts are exhausted and specifically
trying to claim allocations against the alternates fails,
probably because between the time of initial scheduling and
rescheduling something else took up the spare capacity on the
alternate host.

When this happens, MaxRetriesExceeded is raised but the
instance is stuck in BUILD status rather than set to ERROR
status with a fault message.

NOTE(mriedem): In this backport the test is changed slighty
since change Id8b5c48a6e8cf65dc0a7dc13a80a0a72684f70d9 is
not in Rocky so the ProviderUsageBaseTestCase.neutron
attribute does not exist.

We use the oslo.utils save_and_reraise_exception context manager in our
detach device code and catch specific exceptions that mean 'not found'
and raise DeviceNotFound instead. When we do that, the
save_and_reraise_exception context manager logs an ERROR traceback of
the original exception, for informational purposes. This is misleading
when trying to debug other issues, as it makes it look like the caught
exception caused a problem.

This passes the reraise=False keyword arg to the context manager and
sets the 'reraise' attribute to True only if we are not going to raise
a different exception.

This is an experimental feature.

The proposed changes will fix related issues when we run
heartbeat under apache/httpd enviornment with the apache MPM `prefork`
[1] engine and mod_wsgi or uwsgi in a monkey patched environment.

Propose changes to allow user to choose to run the rabbitmq health check
heartbeat in a standard python thread.

Issue
=====

We facing an issue with the rabbitmq driver heartbeat
under apache MPM `prefork` module and mod_wsgi when nova_api monkey
patched the stdlib by using eventlet.

nova_api calling eventlet.monkey_patch() [2] when it runs under mod_wsgi.

This impacts the AMQP heartbeat thread,
which is meant to be a native thread. Instead of checking AMQP sockets
every 15s, It is now suspended and resumed by eventlet. However,
resuming greenthreads can take a very long time if mod_wsgi isn't
processing traffic regularly, which can cause rabbitmq to close the AMQP
connection.

Root Cause
==========

The oslo.messaging RabbitMQ driver and especially the heartbeat
suffer to inherit the execution model of the service which consume him.

In this scenario nova_api need green threads to manage cells and edge
features so nova_api monkey patch the stdlib to obtain async features,
and the oslo.messaging rabbitmq driver endure these changes.

I think the main issue here is that nova_api want async and use eventlet green
threads to obtain it.

Solution
========

We want to allow user to isolate the heartbeat execution model
from the parent process inherited execution model by passing the
`heartbeat_in_pthread` option through the driver config.

While we use MPM `prefork` we want to avoid to use libevent and epoll.

If the `heartbeat_in_pthread` option is given we want to force to use the
python stdlib threading module to run the
rabbitmq heartbeat to avoid issue related to a non ""standard""
environment. I mean ""standard"" because async features isn't the default
config in mostly case, starting by apache which define `prefork` is the
default engine.

This is an experimental feature, we can help us to ensure to run heartbeat
through a classical python thread

We use the same periodic_interval to update the service record
and compare it with current time when doing 'service list'. So, It's
possible there will be a small window where 'service list' would show
the engine as down. Tools that use service list for monitoring would
wrongly assume the service as down. Let's change service list to
report the service as down if it's not updated in 2*periodic_interval.

Change I2d9ab06b485f76550dbbff46f79f40ff4c97d12f in Rocky
(and backported through to Pike) added error handling to
the resize_instance and finish_resize methods to revert
allocations in placement when a failure occurs.

This is OK for resize_instance, which runs on the source
compute, as long as the instance.host/node values have not
yet been changed to the dest host/node before RPC casting
to the finish_resize method on the dest compute. It's OK
because the instance is still on the source compute and the
DB says so, so any attempt to recover the instance via hard
reboot or rebuild will be on the source host.

This is not OK for finish_resize because if we fail there
and revert the allocations, the instance host/node values
are already pointing at the dest compute and by reverting
the allocations in placement, placement will be incorrectly
tracking the instance usage with the old flavor against the
source node resource provider rather than the new flavor
against the dest node resource provider - where the instance
is actually running and the nova DB says the instance lives.

This change adds a simple functional regression test to
recreate the bug with a multi-host resize. There is already
a same-host resize functional test marked here which will
need to be fixed as well.

Conflicts:
      nova/tests/functional/test_servers.py
      nova/virt/fake.py

NOTE(mriedem): The test_servers conflict is due to not having
change If6aa37d9b6b48791e070799ab026c816fda4441c in Rocky. As
a result, the new regression test also had to be modified for
the call to assertFlavorMatchesAllocation. The fake module
conflict is due to not having change

which have been modifed to test revert resize on
stable branches.

This is the 1st commit message:

  Run revert resize tests in nova-live-migration

  In order to test multinode resize revert (which is currently only
  tested in the single node tempest-full-py3 job), this patch renames
  the nova-live-migration job to nova-multinode and makes it run revert
  resize test via a Tempest RC file. The existing live migration and
  evacuate tests are left as post-test hook scripts because they do
  things like change Tempest settings, start Glance, and force down
  compute nodes.

  Change-Id: I980177410c16ecbd809856440ac633453fa20ea8

This is the commit message #2:

  [DNM] use iptables in nova-multinode

  This patch is jsut for testing to see if we can repoduce the
  issue we are seeing downstrem upstream.

  my current working theroy is because we are using iptables
  in the downstream ci which enable the hybrid plug workflow it
  change the timeing of when the network events are sent.

  in a non hybrid plug case the network events are sent after the
  vm is resumed and libvirt plugs the interface back into ovs
  in the hybrid plug case as we have not called unplug on the souce
  node the veth pair and intermeidate linux bridge still exist when
  we activate the souce binding so the event woudl be sent imedetly before
  we start waithgin for it. this is what we belive is the souce of the
  bug and this shoudl hopefully repoduce it.

  Change-Id: Idf0ed84bae0bedbb70b5a65ee804ec1f2f4a27ee

This is the commit message #3:

  Add neutron-tempest-iptables_hybrid job to experimental queue

  Due to regression bug 1833902 we should have the option to
  run the neutron job that tests the OVS hybrid plug configuration
  on specific patches.

  We could eventually consider running this in the check queue
  like neutron-tempest-linuxbridge with a strict set of irrelevant
  files but that would require some thought, i.e. we'd want to run
  the job on changes to nova/compute/manager.py since the network
  vif model bind events code is used in the ComputeManager and is
  specific to OVS hybrid plug ports. Rather than get bogged down in
  thinking up what that set is, this change takes the easy path and
  just throws the job into the on-demand experimental queue.

  Change-Id: Id5172d97b349abe59b47d1284e97943091652419
  Related-Bug: #1833902

this modifed versions of those commits will run
3 jobs in the check queue
  - nova-live-migration
  - nova-live-migration-iptables
  - neutron-tempest-iptables_hybrid

nova-live-migartion and the iptables variant
will test teh multi node case
and the neutron-tempest-iptables_hybrid will test
same host resize.

When running a 3-nodes Redis cluster with TLS, we use an intermediate
container redis_tls_proxy for all the encrypted communication between
the redis nodes.

The intermediate container is managed by paunch, so it shouldn't use
the container image tagged :pcmklatest. This tag is a intermediate
tag only meant to be consumed by pacemaker to implement container
update without service disruption. When used in paunch, it causes
the deployment to fail at step 2.

Configure redis_tls_proxy to use heat parameter ContainerRedisImage
instead. That is the image meant to be consumed by paunch containers.

Start the process of reporting some concurrency numbers by including
a 500 x 10 'ab' run against the query URL used in each perfload job.

There's duplication removal that could be done here, but we leave
that until we've determined if this is working well.

The PLACEMENT_URL is updated to use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost;
ab will attempt to use the IPV6 version of localhost if that's the
case, and we've not bound the placement server to that interface.

The timeout on the placement-nested-perfload job has been raised to
1 hour as the default 30 minutes is leading to a timeout. If that's
still not enough we'll explore lowering concurrency.

We will quite likely need to adapt the mysql configuration if we
intend to continue down this road.

Rpm-packaging is the only project to not have a url.

Without this patch, it will be impossible to enforce a schema
validation on the presence of an URL.

This is a problem as I believe that we should validate the
presence of an URL, because a link is one of the best ways to
get started with a problem.

This fixes it by providing the rpm-packaging landing page,
pointing to each of the project's source code and documentation.

The RowProxy objects in the `res` list are already dict-like,
so casting them to dict is redundant.

In an environment with 1623 resource providers, the list
comprehension that does the dict-ification contributes 36%
of the time.

We blindly bind mount /etc/corosync/corosync.conf from the host to the
container as that is required by pcs when running on pacemaker nodes
when using pcs 0.9/pcmk 1.x.

When running on a pacemaker remote node, this will actually barf on it
because that file does not exist on a remote node:

        ""stderr: error checking path \""/etc/corosync/corosync.conf\"": stat /etc/corosync/corosync.conf: no such file or directory"",

This is not an issue with docker because docker simply creates non
existing host bind mount points.
So we should not bind mount this when we run podman because podman and
HA only works on RHEL/CentOS 8 and it is not required there.

Tested this on an Stein deployment with RHEL8 as OS and I correctly
get a composable HA environment using pacemaker remote:

According to Docker upstream release notes [1] MountFlags should be

1. https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#18091

""Important notes about this release

In Docker versions prior to 18.09, containerd was managed by the Docker
engine daemon. In Docker Engine 18.09, containerd is managed by systemd.
Since containerd is managed by systemd, any custom configuration to the
docker.service systemd configuration which changes mount settings (for
example, MountFlags=slave) breaks interactions between the Docker Engine
daemon and containerd, and you will not be able to start containers.

Run the following command to get the current value of the MountFlags
property for the docker.service:

sudo systemctl show --property=MountFlags docker.service
MountFlags=

Update your configuration if this command prints a non-empty value for
MountFlags, and restart the docker service.""

The mac ageing configuration on linux bridges is now
conditional and caller controlled. By default mac ageing
is unspecified and will use the kernel's default of 300
seconds. For ovs with hybrid plug we override this to
0 to prevent packet loss issue during some migration
edgecases. This change reverts disabling mac ageing

introduced during the brctl removal via inheriting the
ovs plugin's default behavior when the bridge create

_get_usages_by_provider_tree this has usage information for _all_
the providers in the contributing trees, even those providers that
do not provide any resources (otherwise we wouldn't be able to

This means that the list of rp ids passed to provider_ids_from_rp_ids
includes all the relevant rps and the returned data structure can
itself be used to find root_provider_uuid and parent_provider_uuid,
instead of doing the join.

This speeds up the database query. Combined with the expanding
bindparam in the previous patch, this cleans up provider_ids_from_rp_ids
nicely.

which in fact during update_port_postcommit() does nothing with
the port, only validates it [0].

In networking-ovn this test is runned against real mechanism driver:
networking_ovn.ml2.mech_driver.OVNMechanismDriver. This ends with
little difference - to port dict 'network' information is added
during call of update_port_postcommit(). The port data itself
remains the same.

This patch modifies the test to pop('network'), and checks if other
fields were not modified, like in neutron tests.

Comparing benchmarks of creating (repeated) resource classes with
traits, it became clear that creating resource classes [1] was about
1/3rd faster. Comparing the code, they were very similar, however
the resource class side was ordered to check for existence first
before attempting to do a create(). This meant that in the fairly common
case where a resource class already existed we could finish early.

This change updates the code so that the common idiom used in clients
of ""ensuring a trait"" with PUT /traits/$name routine to be the same
as the ""ensuring a resource class"" with PUT /resource_classes/$name
routine: check that it is already there, first. Since it is best
practice to always ensure trait or resource class before using a
CUSTOM_ one, this is a good orientation.

Note that with the recent addition of the AttributeCache, these queries
for get_by_name [2] go to the ResourceClass or Trait cache. However, at
this stage in processing, the cache is empty and calls to get_by_name
will fill it.

A unit test is added to confirm that the 'put_trait' handler will look
at get_by_name and then go back to assuming the trait exists if the
create() fails because it already exists. The general behavior of
whether a trait is created or updated is confirmed by the gabbit
tests in trait.yaml. That test also confirms that we have a legit
last-modified time when we fall through both exceptions and make
the assumption that a trait was created by some other thread. It is
safe to use 'now' as the last-modified time because it was created
in this same second, just not by us.

In Pike, we added a UUID field to services and during an upgrade from
Ocata => Pike, when instances are accessed joined with their associated
services, we generate a UUID for the services on-the-fly.

This causes a problem in the scenario where an operator upgrades their
cluster and has old, deleted services with hostnames matching existing
services associated with instances. When we go to generate the service
UUID for the old, deleted service, we hit a ServiceTooOld exception.

This addresses the problem by not bothering to generate a UUID for a
deleted service. One alternative would be to exclude deleted services
when we join the 'instances' and 'services' tables, but I'm not sure
whether that approach might cause unintended effects where service
information that used to be viewable for instances becomes hidden.

The tripleo-ansible-inventory command produces an inventory

ceph-ansible integration then creates its own inventory for
the ceph-ansible playbook run. This patch makes generating
a separate inventory for ceph-ansible no longer necessary.

TripleO services already map to the same inventory groups
used by ceph-ansible, e.g. ceph_clients:clients, ceph_mons:
mons, ceph_osds:osds, etc. This patch maps the names of the
TripleO inventory Ceph groups to the names of the inventory
groups used by ceph-ansible and creates a duplicate group
entry in the inventory, but with the names that ceph-ansible
expects.

Sphinx 1.8 introduced [1] the '--keep-going' argument which, as its name
suggests, keeps the build running when it encounters non-fatal errors.
This is exceptionally useful in avoiding a continuous edit-build loop
when undertaking large doc reworks where multiple errors may be
introduced.

This changes gabbits/nested-perfload.yaml to create a tree of
providers based on one of the compute nodes in the NUMANetworkFixture
used in the functional tests. For the time being only one type of
compute node is created (of which there will be 1000 instances).
Room is left for future expansion as requirements expand.

The resulting hierarchy has 7 resource providers.

The allocation candidates query is:

GET /allocation_candidates?
    resources=DISK_GB:10&
    required=COMPUTE_VOLUME_MULTI_ATTACH&
    resources_COMPUTE=VCPU:1,MEMORY_MB:256&
    required_COMPUTE=CUSTOM_FOO&
    resources_FPGA=FPGA:1&
    group_policy=none&
    same_subtree=_COMPUTE,_FPGA

This is a step in the right direction but is not yet a complete
exercising of all the nested functionality. It is, however, more
complex than prior, notably testing 'same_subtree'. We should
continue to iterate to get it doing more.

This tests the scenario where an operator has upgraded from Ocata =>
Pike but has old, deleted services that share the same hostname with
currently existing, running services. The current behavior is that
ServiceTooOld is raised when we try to generate a UUID for the old,
deleted service while querying for a list of instances. After the bug
is fixed, we should be able to successfully query for a list of
instances.

This attempts to recreate the following scenario:

1) boot instance on ocata host where the compute service
   does not have a uuid
2) migrate instance
3) delete the ocata service (thus deleting the compute node)
4) start compute service with the same name
5) migrate instance to newly-created compute node
6) upgrade to pike where services.uuid data migration happens
7) list instances as admin to join on the services table

The failure occurs when listing instances because the deleted
service with the same name as the compute host that the instance
is running on gets pulled from the DB and the Service object
attempts to set a uuid on it, which fails since it's not using
a read_deleted=""yes"" context.

While working on this, the service_get_all_by_binary DB API
method had to be fixed to not hard-code read_deleted=""no"" since
the test needs to be able to read deleted services, which it can
control via its own context object (note that
RequestContext.read_deleted already defaults to ""no"" so the
hard-coding in the DB API is unnecessarily restrictive).

NOTE(mriedem): This backport needed to use the set_nodes/restore_nodes
methods on the fake virt module since change
I2cf2fcbaebc706f897ce5dfbff47d32117064f9c is not in Stein.

expanded to also run Keycloak for the purpose of enabling Keystone
to use it for OpenID Connect or SAML based federation.  The ansible
role that will be used to deploy Keycloak (nkinder.keycloak) will
configure firewalld for the Keycloak ports, which results in blocking

SchedulerReportClient methods invoke Placement APIs with the
X-Openstack-Request-Id header (via the global_request_id kwarg to SDK
Proxy methods) so that log entries on both sides can be correlated as
being associated with a single workflow.

Previously, SchedulerReportClient was using context.global_id of the
context passed in from the caller. This was (always? usually? often?) a
different RequestContext than the one in oslo.context's
threadlocal storage, which is the one oslo.log uses for logging. This
meant that the X-Openstack-Request-Id being sent to Placement was
worthless because it didn't show up *anywhere* in the logs on the Nova
side.

At some point to work around this problem a method
get_placement_request_id was written to extract the
X-Openstack-Request-Id from Placement's Response, and that request ID
was then being prepended to log messages. Since that value corresponded
to the Placement request's (not-global) request_id, which was being
logged properly on the Placement side, it provided a way to correlate
the log entries as desired.

Since [1] we *should* be properly overwriting or *not* overwriting the
thread's RequestContext, and properly copying forward its
global_request_id regardless, so it should now be safe and effective to
use context.global_id for X-Openstack-Request-Id. However, I'm still not
confident this is working properly, so what this commit does is to
retrieve the global_id from the context in oslo.context's threadlocal
storage and compare it to context.global_id, issuing error logs if it
(the threadlocal one) is either unset or different from the one we
should be using. In the latter case, we'll use the threadlocal one so
that it's actually useful, but hopefully we should be able to get rid of
this.

The 'kayobe overcloud inventory discover' command can be used to discover an
overcloud inventory from the nodes in the ironic service running on the seed.
This works well for cases where the nodes have been autodiscovered, and as such
do not exist in the kayobe inventory.

There is another use case where overcloud nodes already exist in the kayobe
inventory. In that case we don't want to run the above command, as it will
create duplicate hosts in the inventory. We do however want the part of that
command that generates bifrost host variables for the overcloud nodes.

This change moves the generation of bifrost host variables to the 'kayobe
overcloud provision' and 'kayobe overcloud hardware inspect' commands,
which are used in each of these cases.

This reverts commit eaa766ee2093c24fd61c61e52f46bdd9ff9e93d2.

The change regressed the behavior of the ImagePropertiesFilter
because existing images with hypervisor_type=QEMU, which would
match what is reported for hypervisor_type in the API for both
qemu/kvm virt_type nodes, will now get filtered out for hosts
where the configured virt_type is kvm.

Note that both the ImagePropertiesFilter docs [1] and
hypervisor_type image property docs [2] mention that for both
qemu and kvm nodes the value to use is qemu since that is the
actual hypervisor.

Presumably the change was made for a deployment with some
hosts configured with virt_type=qemu and other hosts configured
with virt_type=kvm and there were separate images with
hypervisor_type=qemu and hypervisor_type=kvm to match those hosts
for scheduler filter, but as noted this was a regression in
behavior for something that could have been achieved using
host aggregates and the AggregateImagePropertiesIsolation filter.

We could even use traits and a placement request pre-filter these
days for a more modern approach.

Also, since the API continues to report hypervisor_type=QEMU it's
doubly confusing for operators to have to configure their images
to use hypervisor_type=kvm (despite the docs).

And finally, any existing instances which have hypervisor_type=qemu
embedded in their RequestSpec can no longer be migrated to kvm
hosts without manually fixing the entries in the request_specs
table in the API DB.

Note that this is not a clean revert because of change
I5d95bd50279a6bf903a5793ad5f3ae9d06f085f4 made in Stein.

The server fault ""message"" is always shown in the API
server response, regardless of policy or user role.

The fault ""details"" are only shown to users with the
admin role when the fault code is 500.

The problem with this is for non-nova exceptions, the
fault message is a string-ified version of the exception
(see nova.compute.utils.exception_to_dict) which can
contain sensitive information which the non-admin owner
of the server can see.

This change adds a functional test to recreate the issue
and a change to exception_to_dict which for the non-nova
case changes the fault message by simply storing the
exception type class name. Admins can still see the fault
traceback in the ""details"" key of the fault dict in the
server API response. Note that _get_fault_details is
changed so that the details also includes the exception
value which is what used to be in the fault message for
non-nova exceptions. This is necessary so admins can still
get the exception message with the traceback details.

Note that nova exceptions with a %(reason)s replacement
variable could potentially be leaking sensitive details as
well but those would need to be cleaned up on a case-by-case
basis since we don't want to change the behavior of all
fault messages otherwise users might not see information
like NoValidHost when their server goes to ERROR status
during scheduling.

SecurityImpact: This change contains a fix for CVE-2019-14433.

We blindly bind mount /etc/corosync/corosync.conf from the host to the
container as that is required by pcs when running on pacemaker nodes
when using pcs 0.9/pcmk 1.x.

When running on a pacemaker remote node, this will actually barf on it
because that file does not exist on a remote node:

        ""stderr: error checking path \""/etc/corosync/corosync.conf\"": stat /etc/corosync/corosync.conf: no such file or directory"",

This is not an issue with docker because docker simply creates non
existing host bind mount points.
So we should not bind mount this when we run podman because podman and
HA only works on RHEL/CentOS 8 and it is not required there.

Tested this on an Stein deployment with RHEL8 as OS and I correctly
get a composable HA environment using pacemaker remote:

In order to facilitate the nova placement -> placement

during the major upgrade scripts.

This ensures that the nova placement service stays live
until the very last minute before the database migration
is executed, and with these tasks being the last in the
placement role the placement service will be started by
the handler immediately after the database migration
completes.

We also add a notification to the handler if the placement
configuration changes to ensure that the service is
restarted to pick up the changed configuration.

cannot template directly to the file read by the service

particularly important during a major upgrade. We therefore
only put the policy file in place after the service restart.

tasks to simplify them and reduce the tasks/code a little.

Using tox adds an unnecessary layer of misdirection
to the testing setup. This patch aims to remove that
extra layer in such a way that we can make use of
Ansible as early as possible in the test execution.

The intent is when tests are executed outside of
OpenStack-CI, a thin layer sets up an Ansible venv
and executes the tests like zuul would. Inside
OpenStack-CI we should be able to just execute the
plays using zuul's Ansible.

TODO:
- Instead of executing the test scripts in qequence,
  have something that can figure out the jobs for
  the repository, then execute them using Ansible.

The JIT implementation of the unbound client config is at odds with
the way that the pip install and proxy configuration is done in that:

1. For apt to update after configuring the proxy, it needs working DNS
   resolution.
2. For the pip_install role to execute successfully, it needs working
   DNS resolution.

As such we need to revert them implementation of the JIT unbound client
configuration and do it once for all containers immediately after their
creation.

The TESTING_BRANCH environment variable is provided by the
run_tests.sh script and is derived from the .gitreview file.

This ensures that once the master branch becomes a stable
branch, the constraints from the stable branch in the
integrated repository will automatically get used once the
.gitreview file is updated.

To achieve this benefit, however, we now force the use of
run_tests.sh to execute tests instead of allowing the use
of 'tox -e ...' after the initial setup. As such, we check
for the presence of the required environment variables which
should be setup by run_tests.sh and if they're not there,
then we exit and inform the user.

To ensure that the required environment variables are present
we export them appropriately in run_tests.sh and modify the
tox configuration to pass them into the tox test.

Now that we're using the general templates, we can slim down
the role test definitions. We can also remove tests which are
not being watched, or which are fundamentally broken. With
this we can also remove unused scripts/plays.

We do the following:

1. We remove the 'ssl' job, given that the person working on
   that is no longer doing so, and no-one else has picked up
   the work.
2. We remove the 'func_base' and 'func_log'. They are unused
   relics of the past.

Currently the devel packages are installed everywhere,
but they only need to be where the wheels are built.

Also, there is already a task to install the packages
needed on the target hosts when installing - so we do
not need to give the same list to the venv install role
because they will already have been installed.

Finally, we remove the unnecessary installation of the
compiling packages because the python venv build role
