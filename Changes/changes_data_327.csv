The security group and aggregate metadata wrinkles in the
tests were orphaned with changes I0326f25754e7a13dfc18f207242052412189c743
and Ia057dcc43c555187a4a1466a9e748b978c46d4a4 respectively. As a result
we can remove that code from the tests and also remove the context
argument passed to the virtapi methods since the only virtapi
function, wait_for_instance_event, does not take a context parameter.
ComputeVirtAPITest.assertExpected is also unused and removed here.

This code enables adding emulated TPM support to a guest instance
as described in the specs.  Support for cold migration and resize is
added in a follow-on patch.

The feature can be requested by specifying the desired TPM version
as a trait in either the flavor extra-specs or the image properties.

trait:COMPUTE_SECURITY_TPM_2_0=required will enable vTPM 2.0 support
trait:COMPUTE_SECURITY_TPM_1_2=required will enable vTPM 1.2 support

If the host supports new enough versions of libvirt and qemu and has
the necessary binaries installed it will advertise the above traits.

For vTPM 2.0, there are two device models available; TIS and CRB with
TIS being the default. The model can be selected in the flavor
extra-specs by specifying hw:tpm_model=TIS or hw:tpm_model=CRB. The
model can also be selected by specifying ""hw_tpm_model"" in the image
properties.

If the image properties and flavor extra-specs specify mutually-
incompatible settings, an exception will be raised in nova-compute.

There are a class of applications which expect to use a TPM device
to store secrets.  In order to run these applications in a virtual
machine, it would be useful to expose a virtual TPM device within
the guest.  Accordingly, the suggestion is to create a placement
trait which could be requested in the flavor or image which would
cause such a device to be added to the VM by the relevant virt
driver.

needs to be branch-specific since devstack-plugin-ceph

specific so we don't want to enable this on any nova

The previous 'Help Most Needed' list was presenting information in a way
that focused on the desires of the community rather than the value that
sponsoring organisations can generate - for both themselves and the
commons. Replace the list with a new list of 'Upstream Investment
Opportunities', and a process to keep them current by removing them
after they have been on the list for between 6 months and a year, so
that the submitter is forced to reaffirm their interest and the TC is
forced to re-evaluate the relevancy.

Since the current 'Help Most Needed' entries are generally not written
in a style emphasising the value to a business of investing, the initial
list is empty and will be filled as the TC evaluates business cases
according to its new criteria and understanding of the needs of
potential contributing organisations.

To preserve the existing information, the contents of the current 'Help
Most Needed' list appear as the 2018 upstream investment opportunites.
Links to the old list will temporarily redirect here until such time as
the new entries are in place, at which point we can redirect to the main
page with the latest index.

The OVS Firewall blocks traffic that does not have either the IPv4 or
IPv6 ethertypes at present.  This is a behavior change compared to the
iptables_hybrid firewall, which only operates on IP packets and thus
does not address other ethertypes.

This is a lightweight change that sets a configuration option in the
neutron openvswitch agent configuration file for permitted ethertypes
and then ensures that the requested ethertypes are permitted on
initialization.  This addresses the security and usability concerns on
both master and stable branches while a full-fledged extension to the
security groups API is considered.

1. Add bindep.txt for Octavia

job runs. This is good as we need to call out our platform package
requirements.
This patch adds a bindep.txt to Octavia to capture those
package requirements.

2. ""Resolve"" bandit issue with sha1 hashes

We only use them as a consistent hash, not for anything security
related. Even if someone could manage a hash collision or something,
the worst that could happen is their own LB stops working...
So, just tell bandit to ignore them.

does so. Besides that it removes possibility of providing different

Stein only.

Currently the kolla-ansible-centos-source-upgrade-ceph job is failing on
the stable/stein branch.

The problem occurs with mariadb, when performing an upgrade to the Stein
release which has a new version of mariadb. It appears that when the
slave mariadb services are shut down, we do not wait for the container
to stop, so the service may not shut down cleanly. This prevents it from
starting up successfully.

This change waits for the container to stop after the shutdown command
has been executed. It also temporarily replaces the restart policy of
the container to prevent it from starting up again after the shutdown.

This is not required in other branches since the mariadb shutdown
workaround was only added in the stein branch for bug 1820325.

There is a second issue that is addressed here. The Stein release
switched from using xtrabackup to mariabackup for galera state syncing.
If we run both container versions at the same time on different hosts
then we can get an error such as the following:

sh: wsrep_sst_mariabackup: command not found

We therefore now stop the cluster and perform a recovery during an
upgrade, if we detect that xtrabackup is in use.

Finally, we now wait for the bootstrap host to report that it is in an
OPERATIONAL state. Without this we can see errors where the MariaDB
cluster is not ready when used by other services.

There is a race condition during nova deploy since we wait for at least
one compute service to register itself before performing cells v2 host
discovery.  It's quite possible that other compute nodes will not yet
have registered and will therefore not be discovered. This leaves them
not mapped into a cell, and results in the following error if the
scheduler picks one when booting an instance:

Host 'xyz' is not mapped to any cell

The problem has been exacerbated by merging a fix [1][2] for a nova race
condition, which disabled the dynamic periodic discovery mechanism in
the nova scheduler.

This change fixes the issue by waiting for all expected compute services
to register themselves before performing host discovery. This includes
both virtualised compute services and bare metal compute services.

This performs the same as a deploy-bifrost, but first stops the
bifrost services and container if they are running.

This can help where a docker stop may lead to an ungraceful shutdown,
possibly due to running multiple services in one container.

1) all_nodes.j2: use DICT.items() instead of dict.iteritems
The DICT.iteritems method has been removed in Python 3.

There are two recommended alternatives:

  for KEY, VALUE in DICT.items():
      pass

  or

  from ansible.module_utils.six import iteritems

  for KEY, VALUE in iteritems(DICT):
      pass

This patch replace iteritems by items.

2) vip_data.j2: use ""in"" instead of ""has_key()""

dict.has_key() was removed in Python 3 and we should use ""in"" operator

This changes the handling required for creating the 'mappings'
output in the allocation_requests section of the GET
/allocation_candidates response.

Whereas before they were tracked as a suffix on the
AllocationRequestResource object, this became untenable when it
was realized (see the linked Story) that sometimes multiple
request groups (and thus suffixes) can consume resources from
the same provider and the original implementation did not
account for this. Change Ifb687698dd1aa434781d06c7f111d8969120bf71
provides a fix for this but it is represents some cognitive and
maintenance issues because it associates a vector value with a
scalar concept. That is: it is illogical for an
AllocationRequestResource (a representation of single consumption of
a resource) with multiple suffixes doing that consumption.

Instead, a new mappings attribute is added to AllocationRequest.
This is probably where it should have been from the start, because
the things we want to manage are:

* mappings
* in an allocation_request

All existing tests pass. An additional test, borrowed from
Ifb687698dd1aa434781d06c7f111d8969120bf71 , is also included to make
sure we cover some of the ideas raised in that patch.

The old way of renmaing depended on adding udev rule
before creating vf-representors and so we faced race condition on

So now we are creating vf-representors and after that we adding the
udev rules and trigerring them at the end
Also because the old name of UDEV_RULE_FILE(70-persistent-net.rules) is
used by another module, so we renamed the udev_rule_file to
(80-persistent-os-net-config.rules) and with that way it will override
any previouse rules in (70-persistent-net.rules) and will not any cause
any confustion
Addition to that, we also added a udev rule to make vf-representors
unmanaged by NetworkManager in order to be renamed successfully

Change I7b8622b178d5043ed1556d7bdceaf60f47e5ac80 started deleting the
compute node resource provider associated with a compute node when
deleting a nova-compute service. However, it would only delete the
first compute node associated with the service which means for an
ironic compute service that is managing multiple nodes, the resource
providers were not cleaned up in placement. This fixes the issue by
iterating all the compute nodes and cleaning up their providers.
Note this could be potentially a lot of nodes, but we don't really
have many good options here but to iterate them and clean them up
one at a time.

Note that this is best-effort but because of how the
SchedulerReportClient.delete_resource_provider method ignores
ResourceProviderInUse errors, and we could have stale allocations
on the host for which delete_resource_provider is not accounting,
namely allocations from evacuated instances (or incomplete migrations
though you can't migrate baremetal instances today), we could still
delete the compute service and orphan those in-use providers. That,
however, is no worse than before this change where we did not try
to cleanup all providers. The issue described above is being tracked
with bug 1829479 and will be dealt with separately.

Adds a gabbi test demonstrating the bug in the associated story:

GET /allocation_candidates
with group_policy=none
and two request groups
which consolidate to land on the same provider

In this case, the mappings should show two entries: one from each
request group to the (same) provider.

However, the test demonstrates that only one mapping is returned. (I
think it's arbitrary which request group will be represented, so the
test only asserts that the size of the mappings dict is one instead of
two.)

In Train cycle, iPXE boot with [pxe]ipxe_enabled option in
ironic.conf file will be removed. And ipxe boot interface
will be the only boot interface to deploy Ironic node with
iPXE. Till Train, iRMC driver has supported iPXE boot with

This commit copes with this incompatibility and supports
ipxe boot interface by adding ipxe.iPXEBoot to

This changes provides the implementation of the subnetpool prefix
operations extension. This exposes explicit API's for adding to and
removing from the prefix list of a subnetpool. Prefixes added to a
subnetpool are subject to the prefix uniqueness constraints imposed
by address scopes. Prefixes to be removed from a subnetpool must not
be allocated to an existing subnet, and the subnet using the prefix
must be deleted before the prefix can be removed from the subnetpool.

This change alters the way we archive temporary working files from
a bzip2'd tar file, to a simple directory.  This is necessary since
changes such as containerized undercloud validations rely on the
presence of some of the working files such as the containerized
undercloud's inventory, and as such there is a requirement on the
operator to unpack the bzip2 in order to run validations.

This change simply places the temporary working files inside an
appropriately named directory for such use.

When running deploy or reconfigure for Keystone,
ansible/roles/keystone/tasks/deploy.yml calls init_fernet.yml,
which runs /usr/bin/fernet-rotate.sh, which calls keystone-manage
fernet_rotate.

This means that a token can become invalid if the operator runs
deploy or reconfigure too often.

This change splits out fernet-push.sh from the fernet-rotate.sh
script, then calls fernet-push.sh after the fernet bootstrap
performed in deploy.

This change correctly mimics the behaviour of the original imagebackend
by returning a mock to act as the returned class. This allows any static
methods present in the underlying imagebackend.Image class to be
accessed by tests using the fake_imagebackend fixture.

Previously the number of alternates provided when scheduling multiple
instances in a single request would be limited in smaller environments
due to hosts being discounted as alternates if they were already
selected by one or more instance in the request.

The number of alternates provided in such environments has now been
increased when scheduling more instances than the total number of hosts.
This should ensure instances are able to reschedule in these smaller
environments if issues are encountered with the host initially selected.

When handling ssh keys and known hosts for the relation(s) to the
nova-compute units, the unit is passed to many of the utility functions.
The purpose of the unit param is to derive a consistent remote_service
string with which to create a pair of associated known_hosts and
authorized_keys files.  However, it's not obvious that this is being
done, when reading the code.

This patch refactors many of those functions so that a remote_service
param is passed; this has the benefit of making it clear that it's the
remote_service that is being made unique (for the known_hosts and
authorized keys) as well as the optional user param, but also so that
the deriving of the remote_service is reduced (where possible).

The poise-python cookbook is no longer maintained by the upstream maintainer and
is causing lots of issues for the testing pipeline. Originally we needed this to
install a newer openstack-client via pip, but we no longer do that.

The one exception is in the integration cookbook which I'll be pushing a change
for that as well.

In order to do this, we need to include EPEL on RHEL which doesn't seem to have
any current dependency issues so I think it's safe to bring back.

Netfilter postrouting hooks don't provide the input interface. That
works fine in iptables implementation as the comparison simply happens
against an empty string, but cause problems with nftables which
aborts rule processing due to no data to compare against and
the rule doesn't match.
This is a problem in systems where nftables are used (e.g. RHEL 8).

This patch fixes this issue by removing input interface from
POSTROUTING rule used to prevent SNAT for router's internal traffic.

When running deploy or reconfigure for Keystone,
ansible/roles/keystone/tasks/deploy.yml calls init_fernet.yml,
which runs /usr/bin/fernet-rotate.sh, which calls keystone-manage
fernet_rotate.

This means that a token can become invalid if the operator runs
deploy or reconfigure too often.

This change splits out fernet-push.sh from the fernet-rotate.sh
script, then calls fernet-push.sh after the fernet bootstrap
performed in deploy.

Key benefits of Secure Boot:

  - It provides protection from boot-time malware
  - Provides a trusted boot path

It seems that in newer ansible versions the error strings have
changed and we are no longer able to use the hard coded
""UNREACHABLE"" string in our stop test.  For now changing the
test to just skip the string investigation.  Also updating some
package dependencies to match those in kolla-ansible.

We need the 3.5 to 3.6 migration along with the UNREACHABLE
string change together to clean up the test failures  Neither
can be fixed without the other.  Thanks zhulingjie!!

When an OCF bundle is managed by pacemaker it runs pacemaker-remote
inside the container. The communication between the pacemaker cluster
and the remote happens through a so-called control port. In the case of
ovn-dbs, this port is set to 3125 by default:
https://github.com/openstack/puppet-tripleo/blob/master/manifests/profile/pacemaker/ovn_dbs_bundle.pp#L62

We need to make sure that the cluster is always able to connect to said
port as the connection might come from a cluster node that is not the
same node where the ovn bundle is running.

This has worked so far only by pure luck because pacemaker will retry
the connection from each controller node and eventually when the
connection comes from the same host as the one where the bundle is
running it succeeds (INPUT rules do not apply to same-host connections).

Tested and correctly observed port 3125/tcp being open in iptables:
* Before
[root@controller-0]# iptables -nvL INPUT |grep 3125
[root@controller-0]#

* After
[root@controller-0]# iptables -nvL INPUT |grep 3125

Since cells v2 was introduced, nova operators must run two commands to
migrate the database schemas of nova's databases - nova-manage api_db
sync and nova-manage db sync. It is necessary to run them in this order,
since the db sync may depend on schema changes made to the api database
in the api_db sync.

This change clarifies this ordering in the upgrade and nova-manage
documentation. It also states that the return code should be zero for a
successful DB sync.

This proposal will add support to Kolla-Ansible for Cloudkitty
 InfluxDB storage system deployment. The feature of InfluxDB as the
 storage backend for Cloudkitty was created with the following commit
 https://github.com/openstack/cloudkitty/commit/
 c4758e78b49386145309a44623502f8095a2c7ee

Problem Description
===================

With the addition of support for InfluxDB in Cloudkitty, which is
achieving general availability via Stein release, we need a method to
easily configure/support this storage backend system via Kolla-ansible.

Kolla-ansible is already able to deploy and configure an InfluxDB
system. Therefore, this proposal will use the InfluxDB deployment
configured via Kolla-ansible to connect to CloudKitty and use it as a
storage backend.

If we do not provide a method for users (operators) to manage
Cloudkitty storage backend via Kolla-ansible, the user has to execute
these changes/configurations manually (or via some other set of
automated scripts), which creates distributed set of configuration
files, ""configurations"" scripts that have different versioning schemas
and life cycles.

Proposed Change
===============

Architecture
------------

We propose a flag that users can use to make Kolla-ansible configure
CloudKitty to use InfluxDB as the storage backend system. When
enabling this flag, Kolla-ansible will also enable the deployment of
the InfluxDB via Kolla-ansible automatically.

CloudKitty will be configured accordingly to [1] and [2]. We will also
externalize the ""retention_policy"", ""use_ssl"", and ""insecure"", to
allow fine granular configurations to operators. All of these
configurations will only be used when configured; therefore, when they
are not set, the default value/behavior defined in Cloudkitty will be
used. Moreover, when we configure ""use_ssl"" to ""true"", the user will
be able to set ""cafile"" to a custom trusted CA file. Again, if these
variables are not set, the default ones in Cloudkitty will be used.

Implementation
--------------
We need to introduce a new variable called
`cloudkitty_storage_backend`. Valid options are `sqlalchemy` or
`influxdb`. The default value in Kolla-ansible is `sqlalchemy` for
backward compatibility. Then, the first step is to change the
definition for the following variable:
`/ansible/group_vars/all.yml:enable_influxdb: ""{{ enable_monasca |
bool }}""`

We also need to enable InfluxDB when CloudKitty is configured to use
it as the storage backend. Afterwards, we need to create tasks in
CloudKitty configurations to create the InfluxDB schema and configure
the configuration files accordingly.

Alternatives
------------
The alternative would be to execute the configurations manually or
handle it via a different set of scripts and configurations files,
which can become cumbersome with time.

Security Impact
---------------
None identified by the author of this spec

Notifications Impact
--------------------
Operators that are already deploying CloudKitty with InfluxDB as
storage backend would need to convert their configurations to
Kolla-ansible (if they wish to adopt Kolla-ansible to execute these
tasks).

Also, deployments (OpenStack environments) that were created with
Cloudkitty using storage v1 will need to migrate all of their data to
V2 before enabling InfluxDB as the storage system.

Other End User Impact
---------------------
None.

Performance Impact
------------------
None.

Other Deployer Impact
---------------------
New configuration options will be available for CloudKitty.
* cloudkitty_storage_backend
* cloudkitty_influxdb_retention_policy
* cloudkitty_influxdb_use_ssl
* cloudkitty_influxdb_cafile
* cloudkitty_influxdb_insecure_connections
* cloudkitty_influxdb_name

Developer Impact
----------------
None

Implementation
==============

Assignee
--------
* `Rafael Weingärtner <rafaelweingartne>`

Work Items
----------
 * Extend InfluxDB ""enable/disable"" variable
 * Add new tasks to configure Cloudkitty accordingly to these new
 variables that are presented above
 * Write documentation and release notes

Dependencies
============
None

Documentation Impact
====================

Version 2.6 of the cryptography library [1] added support for ed25519
ssh keys. This works with OpenSSL >= 1.1.1b.

In nova, we can enable people to use ed25519 ssh keys by using the
necessary cryptography library version. Users must make sure they have
a new enough OpenSSL version, else they won't be able to generate
ed25519 ssh keys using ssh-keygen in the first place. I did a local
test using Ubuntu 18.04 and things ""just worked"" when I generated a
ed25519 ssh key and imported it into nova. I left a comment on the
launchpad bug accordingly.

This updates our minimum version to the latest available version 2.7.

When an OCF bundle is managed by pacemaker it runs pacemaker-remote
inside the container. The communication between the pacemaker cluster
and the remote happens through a so-called control port. In the case of
ovn-dbs, this port is set to 3125 by default:
https://github.com/openstack/puppet-tripleo/blob/master/manifests/profile/pacemaker/ovn_dbs_bundle.pp#L62

We need to make sure that the cluster is always able to connect to said
port as the connection might come from a cluster node that is not the
same node where the ovn bundle is running.

This has worked so far only by pure luck because pacemaker will retry
the connection from each controller node and eventually when the
connection comes from the same host as the one where the bundle is
running it succeeds (INPUT rules do not apply to same-host connections).

Tested and correctly observed port 3125/tcp being open in iptables:

Under the bug in the referenced story, [restated] below,
_consolidate_allocation_requests was copying the first
AllocationRequestResource it saw for a givin rp+rc, and subsequently
just adding resource amounts to it, thereby losing the suffix
(RequestGroup) information from the 2nd+ AllocationRequestResourceZ for
that rp+rc.

This commit resolves the bug by changing
AllocationRequestResource.suffix (previously a single string) to
.suffixes (a set() of strings), and fixing
_consolidate_allocation_requests to properly add to that set when
merging AllocationRequestResourceZ for a given rp+rc combination.

The handler code to produce the rg-rp mappings is modified accordingly
to handle multiple suffixes (instead of just one) per
AllocationRequestResource.

[restated]
GET /allocation_candidates
with group_policy=none
and two request groups
which consolidate to land on the same provider
should generate RequestGroup-to-ResourceProvider mappings with two
entries: one from each request group to the (same) provider.

However, under the referenced bug, only one mapping was returned.

The notification sample test for unshelve waits for the instance to
reach ACTIVE state and then asserts if unshelve.end notification is
emitted properly. However the instance.vm_state is set to ACTIVE earlier[1]
than emitting the unshelve.end notification[2]. This can cause two
different test case failure.

1) _test_unshelve_server() fails with no ushelve.end notification
received.

2) _test_shelve_and_shelve_offload_server() also has a unshelve action
at the end and that test step also only waits for the the ACTIVE state.
So the unshelve.end notification from the end of
_test_shelve_and_shelve_offload_server() can bleed into the
_test_unshelve_server() step causing that it receive one more
notifications.

So this patch adds an extra
self._wait_for_notification('instance.unshelve.end') call to each test
step to prevent the instability.

The compute_changed() function (which handled the cloud-compute relation
changed hook event) was also used in the config-changed and update-charm
hooks.  This meant that it did a lot of work that wasn't necessary for
those hooks.

This patch splits the function up into separate functions that deal with
one thing, and then introduces a new function to call those.  This means
that the other usages compute_changed() now use the actual features that
they need.

The notification sample test for unshelve waits for the instance to
reach ACTIVE state and then asserts if unshelve.end notification is
emitted properly. However the instance.vm_state is set to ACTIVE earlier[1]
than emitting the unshelve.end notification[2]. This can cause two
different test case failure.

1) _test_unshelve_server() fails with no ushelve.end notification
received.

2) _test_shelve_and_shelve_offload_server() also has a unshelve action
at the end and that test step also only waits for the the ACTIVE state.
So the unshelve.end notification from the end of
_test_shelve_and_shelve_offload_server() can bleed into the
_test_unshelve_server() step causing that it receive one more
notifications.

So this patch adds an extra
self._wait_for_notification('instance.unshelve.end') call to each test
step to prevent the instability.

This patch fixes an issue with Postgres HA where
the PVC which stores the database was filling up with
WAL records and not deleting them due to some
misconfigurations with Postgres. Once the PVC
would fill up, replication would fail across the node
and the database would not be able to start, crashing
the system.

Specifically, archive_mode was turned on, but was not
supplied with a function through which to archive the
logs. When WAL archiving is turned on, old WAL files
cannot be removed until the system has archived them first.
However, since we never told the system how to archive the
files, it would repeatedly fail so the WAL files would
never be cleaned up.

Also in this patch are some small house keeping items:
- Lowered the wal_keep_segments drastically so Postgres
  can't keep as many WAL segments around to minimize the
  chance of PVC fill issues
- Turned the wal_level from 'logical' to 'hot_standby'
  to keep it consistent with the fact that Patroni uses
  streaming replication and not logical replication
- Removed the autovaccuum configurations as they are not
  needed

Until now, only environment files were tested for their eXistenZ. This
patch corrects this issue, allowing to get a graceful failure before
plan is compiled and uploaded.

The following files are now checked, and deploy will gracefully fail in
case of non-existing file:
- plan-environment-file
- answers-file
- networks-file

No Bioport nor Pod was harmed for this patch.

This updates the Nagios chart to include an init container for
generating the host and host group definitions Nagios requires to
function. The benefit is that Nagios does not need to constantly
attempt to update its host and host group definitions, which
currently triggers a restart of the Nagios service even in cases
where the host file hasn't changed.  With the introduction of an
init container for handling this, we can also remove the service
check definition and command definition for executing the plugin
at periodic intervals

Commit d8ee0fa027140fb8a7504bd6685b6dcdfe3ac8fe introduced the variable
kolla_enable_keystone without setting a default value and used it to
check whether to template and provide keystone.conf to kolla-ansible,
unlike the extended keystone configuration which was always copied. This
resulted in non-intuitive behaviour if kolla_enable_keystone wasn't
explicitly set by the operator.

This commit sets kolla_enable_keystone to true by default, which matches
the default in kolla-ansible, and uses it instead of hardcoded true
values.

I152fe10ff5a3131950b789d3fd4efa15c554ff09 attempted to ensure LUKS
volumes were formatted using the LUKS v1 header format by using a type
of `luks`. However from cryptsetup 2.1.0 (incorrectly referenced as
2.0.6 in the previous change) this type can actually refer to the newer
LUKS v2 header format in environments where cryptsetup has not complied
with the `--with-default-luks-format=LUKS1` build time configuration
option [1].

This change now explicitly uses the luks1 type when formatting a device
to ensure the correct LUKS v1 header format is used.

Introduce gabbit allocation-candidates-can-split with some test cases
for the upcoming can_split feature. These are (mostly) set up to xfail
right now. When the feature is implemented, change this file as follows:

- Bump the microversion in the header
- Remove xfail:true
- Adjust any error strings etc. according to the real implementation
