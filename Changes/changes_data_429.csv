Generally, we have to pass target object to ``authorize``
when enforce policy check,  but this is ignored during
our develop and review process for a long time, and the
potential issue is anyone can handle the target resource
as ``authorize`` will always succeed if rule is defined
``admin_or_owner`` [1]. Luckily, for most of those APIs
this security concern is protected by our database access
code [2] that only project scope resource is allowed.

However, there is one API that do have security issue when
administrator change the rule into ""admin_or_owner"".

1. ""volume reset_status"", which cinder will update the
resource directly in the database, procedure to reproduce
bug is described on the launchpad.

This patch intends to correct most of cases which can be
easily figured out in case of future code changes.

It is possible for volumes, created from storage pools
which have zero-padding disabled, to contain previous data. This
change prevents these volumes from being created by default. A
user can override this behavior by acknowleding the possibility
with a configuration option.

This is a squash of the four commits that led to the final state in
rocky to not allow the creation of any type of non-zero-padded volumes
to be created. This adds a config option that defaults to the safe
behavior. It is backporting a new config option, and a change in default
behavior, but it should be acceptable in this case so that the security
vulnerability can be addressed.

To check affinity and anti-affinity policies for scheduling instances,
we use the RequestSpec.instance_group.hosts field to check the hosts
that have group members on them. Access of the 'hosts' field calls
InstanceGroup.get_hosts during a lazy-load and get_hosts does a query
for all instances that are members of the group and returns their hosts
after removing duplicates. The InstanceList query isn't targeting any
cells, so it will return [] in a multi-cell environment in both the
instance create case and the instance move case. In the move case, we
do have a cell-targeted RequestContext when setup_instance_group is
called *but* the RequestSpec.instance_group object is queried early in
compute/api before we're targeted to a cell, so a call of
RequestSpec.instance_group.get_hosts() will result in [] still, even
for move operations.

This makes setup_instance_group query all cells for instances that are
members of the instance group if the RequestContext is untargeted, else
it queries the targeted cell for the instances.

This commit aims to correct problems with the resize_up codebase that allows
the snapshot and migration of volume backed VDI/VHDs.  Since these are empty
stub disks, and the XenAPI does not allow these VDIs to be snapped, this results
in an SR_OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED or similar error on attempt.

This change adds a check into the _process_ephemeral_chain_recursive method to
run the current userdevice through volume_utils.is_booted_from_volume.  To
achieve this, the method has been opened in scope to accept custom user_device
objects.  In a future commit we will need to rename this method for clarity
and correct its dependancies that call it.  I have added a TODO for this to be
done by myself. The check will ensure that the userdevice is not volume backed
and then continue to snapshot and migrate the disk as needed, else increment
and move on.

This reverts commit 762463f850e0010f0ec1bbc2bd7689886779a51d.

The commit is reverted because it uses a lookup to resolve the version
of lxc. This is executed on the deploy host and not the targets. The
lxc_container_create role now addresses the differences between lxc2/3
configuration keys dynamically [1] and resolves the installed lxc version
on a per-target basis.

Since I8abdf58a6537dd5e15a012ea37a7b48abd726579 in Newton
we update the RequestSpec.flavor to the new flavor during
a resize. However, if the resize is reverted, we didn't
revert the RequestSpec.flavor to the previous flavor
on the instance, which could cause issues later when
moving the instance since the scheduler will get a
RequestSpec with a flavor that doesn't match the actual
flavor on the instance.

This fixes the bug by updating the RequestSpec.flavor
with instance.old_flavor on resize_revert in the API.
Functional test wrinkles are added.

This fix was ported from the starlingx-staging/stx-nova
repo commit 71acfeae0.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are

The existing Nova's default machine type for ARMv7 ('vexpress-15') was
added more than four years ago (in commit: 5b27fe7: ""libvirt: Allow
specification of default machine type"").  The 'vexpress-15' board is a
specific development board, which has hardware limitations (like only
single ethernet adapter).

The upstream QEMU recommendation[1] for the past couple of years is to
use the 'virt' machine type for both ARMv7, and AArch64, which was
specifically designed to be used with virutal machines.  Quoting a
write-up[2] from QEMU's ARM subsystem maintainer:

    ""Why the 'virt' board?

    ""QEMU has models of nearly 50 different ARM boards, which makes it
    difficult for new users to pick one which is right for their
    purposes.  This wild profusion reflects a similar diversity in the
    real hardware world: ARM systems come in many different flavours
    with very different hardware components and capabilities. A kernel
    which is expecting to run on one system will likely not run on
    another. Many of QEMU’s models are annoyingly limited because the
    real hardware was also limited — there’s no PCI bus on most mobile
    devices, after all, and a fifteen year old development board
    wouldn’t have had a gigabyte of RAM on it.

    ""My recommendation is that if you don’t know for certain that you
    want a model of a specific device, you should choose the “virt”
    board. This is a purely virtual platform designed for use in virtual
    machines, and it supports PCI, virtio, a recent ARM CPU and large
    amounts of RAM. The only thing it doesn’t have out of the box is
    graphics, but graphical programs on a fully emulated system run very
    slowly anyway so are best avoided.""

So, change the default machine type for ARMv7 arch to be 'virt'.

The way in which this check counted compute nodes was
broken because of an incorrect for/else condition. If
the check is run with a nova.conf like we have in
devstack, where the API database is configured but
the [database]/connection is pointing at cell0, where
there are no compute nodes, the check passes saying
there are no compute nodes even if the are compute
nodes found in the cell databases (in the for loop).
This is because the else executes because the for loop
doesn't break, and then _count_compute_nodes returns 0
for cell0 and overwrites the num_computes variable.

This fixes the issue by checking if we have cell mappings
before running the loop, else we hit the else block as
was originally intended.

Due to differences in the way the containers are created, the
package cache must be forcefully updated after creation. If
this is not done then apt thinks that it's up to date and
fails package installs.

We also ensure that the quota is rescanned to ensure that
it is up to date.

The playbook arrangement is also updated to standardise to
the same pattern as the others.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

We made assumptions in the fibre channel connector code that
there was only ever a single lun per volume, even with many
wwns per connections. There is need to support multiple luns
per multipath device, similar to how the iSCSI volumes work.

What we do is allow a list for 'target_luns' and 'target_wwns'
in the connection properties, similar to how the iSCSI connector
treats things like 'target_portals', 'target_luns', etc. we
then group together 'targets' as combination of wwpns and the
lun associated with them. This grouping is used to through
the attach and detach workflow now to determine dev paths and
scsi target information for rescans.

All existing calls with 'target_lun' and 'target_wwn' will
continue working as before, the new plural keys are optional.

When the OSA connection plugin is used on older ansible versions,
and when haproxy runs in a container, a bug exists where the loop_var
fails to properly delegate the task to the haproxy container.

We can avoid using loop_var in the delegation of the task by simply
moving the loop_var up one level so that the endpoint-manage task
file can use {{ item }}.

Deployment jobs may wish to install the ARA callback using the same
methods we use in the gate without using the test-oriented script
gate-check-commit.sh. We can solve this by moving the ARA setup to
a scripts-library function, and then call the function inside
gate-check-commit. This will allow downstream users to source
scripts-library and call the setup_ara function to install ARA
as well.

This docs change will result in switching over to the workflow driven
container prepare by doing the following:

- Only document calling ""openstack tripleo container image prepare""
  when testing more complex ContainerImagePrepare parameters
- Remove reference to containers-default-parameters.yaml, replacing it
  in overcloud deploy with containers-prepare-parameter.yaml directly
- For minor updates, instruct users to check the contents of
  containers-prepare-parameter.yaml so they know what will happen during
  the minor update

This change does not cover major upgrades to Rocky since the major
upgrade docs are still on Queens.

The rocky major upgrade instructions should describe running
""openstack tripleo container image prepare default"" then merging the result
with any customized containers-default-parameters.yaml which they had
in their previous deployment (in the common case, no merging will be
needed).

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the

progressively harder. Rather than waste CI resources and developer time,
we remove the periodic upgrade test.

Previously logging levels were only set explicitly if we wanted debug
level. The problem with this is if you are including the sdk in a system
that sets a global debug logging level then you cannot set a less
verbose logging level in the sdk via enable_logging.

To fix this explicitly set the logging levels in enable_logging which
allows you to override any global application logging levels. We do this
for keystoneauth, urllib3, and stevedore.

This also makes the search pattern for the tag more flexible to

With change I6827137f35c0cb4f9fc4c6f753d9a035326ed01b in
Ocata, we changed the ComputeManager to manage a single
ResourceTracker and that single ResourceTracker will
manage multiple compute nodes. The only time a single
nova-compute service hosts multiple compute nodes is for
ironic where there is a compute node per instance. The
problem is the ResourceTracker.stats variable, unlike the
ResourceTracker.compute_nodes variable, is not node-specific
so it's possible for node stats to leak across nodes based
on how the stats are used (and copied).

This change adds a functional recreate test to show the issue
before it's fixed. The fixture setup had to be tweaked a
bit to avoid modifying class variables by reference between
test cases.

Conflicts:
      nova/tests/functional/compute/test_resource_tracker.py

NOTE(mriedem): The conflict is due to this test module not
existing in Ocata. It was introduced in Pike with change
I59be1cbedc99dcbb0ccde089a9f4737305176324 and changes were
made to it over time. In this backport, the basics needed
for the one test case specific to this patch are added and
everything else, like the placement stuff, is removed.

It appears that ceilometer itself has no tests now that there
is no API, so we switch to simply verifying if the services
are up.

Distro installs for xenial are not working, which is not
surprising given that the service is using queens packages.
We therefore disable the test for follow up in another patch.

The mysql-python package is no longer maintained. We are using
pymysql instead, so this package does not need to be installed.

The Ansible tasks to do work on the MySQL database are all
delegated to the galera containers, so we don't need any of
the dev libraries on the service hosts either.

With this, we also switch django to use pymysql and ensure that
the appropriate distribution package is installed when doing
distro builds.

This is a point that is easily hidden. In the case of not open
port 16379, redis cluster can still be deployed successfully,
but this success is a false success, there is no data communication
between the various nodes. This is because 16379 is the port for
data port[1]. We set the default value in cfg, but in the
case of conf,it is easy to be covered. Adding 16379 to conf.sample
helps the user to reduce some problem caused by the redis
configuration.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

The Service base class already waits for conductor to be responsive
before allowing service startup to continue. However, it does this
after the manager __init__, which could do some things expecting
conductor to be up (and does now in compute). This moves the check
and wait loop above the manager init so we don't start anything in
the manager until we know conductor is alive.

When the OSA connection plugin is used on older ansible versions,
and when haproxy runs in a container, a bug exists where the loop_var
fails to properly delegate the task to the haproxy container.

We can avoid using loop_var in the delegation of the task by simply
moving the loop_var up one level so that the endpoint-manage task
file can use {{ item }}.

In order to create a LB with a specific provider the provider
name should be posted in load balancer creation request,
in case the provider name is not specified, Octavia default
provider will be used.

This patch enhances LBaaS driver to support LB provider functionality.
The functionality of translating K8S-services into Octavia-OVN
load balancers will be based on this change.

Right now we don't have any mechanism to tell the status of OVN
metadata agent. As we want to stay away from RPC to report the
status back to neutron server, this patch is making use of the
nb_cfg mechanism described at [0].

When neutron-server increments the nb_cfg column of the NB_Global
database, OVN metadata agent will detect it by monitoring
the SB_Global table on Southbound database and then copy it to
external_ids:neutron:ovn-metadata-sb-cfg on the right Chassis entry.
This way, neutron-server can tell if the metadata agent is alive on a
particular chassis by simply comparing those two values.

When the OSA connection plugin is used on older ansible versions,
and when haproxy runs in a container, a bug exists where the loop_var
fails to properly delegate the task to the haproxy container.

We can avoid using loop_var in the delegation of the task by simply
moving the loop_var up one level so that the endpoint-manage task
file can use {{ item }}.

Presently IPv6 functionality is broken with OVN. When a VM
sends an IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation request for the router IP,
ovn-controller when it responds with Neighbor Adv packet doesn't
set the 'router' bit in the 'flags' field. This results in the
default route getting delted. The fix [1] tried to addressed this
issue. But that fix was not completely tested in the openstack context.
ovn-northd adds Neighbor Adv flows for router IPs both in the logical
switch pipeline and logical router pipeline. The commit [1] addressed
the issue in the logical router pipeline. It should have removed the
IPv6 Neighbor Adv flows from the logical switch pipeline. The patch [2]
has been proposed upstream to remove these flows from the logical
switch pipeline. Until that is fixed in core OVN, this patch addresses
this issue in networking-ovn itself as a temporary fix (with the intention
to backport as patch [2] may not be available for OVS 2.9).

When 'add_router_interface' is called, this patch sets the router ports
peer's Logical_Switch_Port.addresses column to it's mac address instead
of 'router'. If the Logical_Switch_Port.addresses is not set to 'router',
ovn-northd will not add the Neighbor Adv flows in the logical switch
pipeline, there by mitigating this issue.

Once the patch [2] is merged, we can revert these changes.

Beginning in the Pike release, Nova started sending both versioned

not have any consumers so this causes some queues to fill up until
either the messages expire or they are flushed. This changes the
nova configuration to only send unversioned (legacy) notifications.

For the stack delete operation, do the same provided that we can acquire
the stack lock immediately, and thus don't need to wait for existing
operations to be cancelled before we can change the state to IN_PROGRESS.
In other cases there is still a race.

methods we use in the gate without using the test-oriented script

a scripts-library function, and then call the function inside
gate-check-commit. This will allow downstream users to source
scripts-library and call the setup_ara function to install ARA
as well.

Now that we're using the general templates, we can slim down
the role test definitions. We can also remove tests which are
not being watched, or which are fundamentally broken. With
this we can also remove unused scripts/plays.

We do the following:

1. We remove the 'upgrade' job, given that it's been broken
   all cycle due to the way the job executes and we need to
   regroup to figure out another way to do it. The associated
   scripts are also removed.
2. We consolidate test-vars.yml and the overrides into a single
   file to conform to the standard in other roles and ensure
   that the overrides are only set in one place.
