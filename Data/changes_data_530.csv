As outlined in the spec, fast-forward upgrades aim to take an
environment from an initial release of N to a release of N>=2, beyond
that of the traditionally supported N+1 upgrade path provided today by
many OpenStack projects.

For TripleO the first phase of this upgrade will be to move the
environment to the release prior to the target release. This will be
achieved by disabling all OpenStack control plane services and then
preforming the minimum number of steps required to upgrade each service
through each release until finally reaching the target release.

This change introduces the framework for this phase of the fast-forward
upgrades by adding playbooks and task files as outputs to RoleConfig.

- fast_forward_upgrade_playbook.yaml

This is the top level play and acts as the outer loop of the process,
iterating through the required releases as set by the
FastForwardUpgradeReleases parameter for the fast-forward section of the
upgrade. This currently defaults to Ocata and Pike for Queens.

Note that this play is run against the overcloud host group and it is
currently assumed that the inventory used to run this play is provided
by the tripleo-ansible-inventory command.

- fast_forward_upgrade_release_tasks.yaml

This output simply imports the top level prep and bootstrap task files.

- fast_forward_upgrade_prep_tasks.yaml
- fast_forward_upgrade_bootstrap_tasks.yaml

These outputs act as the inner loop for the fast-forward upgrade phase,
iterating over step values while importing their associated role tasks.

As prep tasks are carried out first for each release we loop over step
values starting at 0 and ending at the defined
fast_forward_upgrade_prep_steps_max, currently 3.

Following this we then complete the bootstrap tasks for each release,
looping over steps values starting at
fast_forward_upgrade_prep_steps_max + 1 , currently 4 and ending at
fast_forward_upgrade_steps_max,currently 9.

- fast_forward_upgrade_prep_role_tasks.yaml
- fast_forward_upgrade_bootstrap_role_tasks.yaml

These outputs then finally import the fast_forward_upgrade_tasks files
generated by the FastForwardUpgradeTasks YAQL query for each role. For
prep tasks these are always included when on an Ansible host of a given
role. This differs from bootstrap tasks that are only included for the
first host associated with a given role.

This will result in the following order of task imports with their
associated value of release and step:

This change converts the existing NIC templates to jinja2 in
order to dynamically render the ports and networks according
to the network_data.yaml. If networks are added to the
network_data.yaml file, parameters will be added to all
NIC templates. The YAML files (as output from jinja with
the default network_data.yaml) are present as an example.

The roles in roles_data.yaml are used to produce NIC configs
for the standard and custom composable roles. In order to
keep the ordering of NICs the same in the multiple-nics
templates, the order of networks was changed in the
network_data.yaml file. This is reflected in the network
templates, and in some of the files that is the only
change.

The roles and roles_data.yaml were modified to include
a legacy name for the NIC config templates for the
built-in roles Controller, Compute, Object Storage,
Block Storage, Ceph Storage, Compute-DPDK, and
Networker roles. There will now be a file produced
with the legacy name, but also one produced with the
<role>-role.j2.yaml format (along with environment
files to help use the new filenames).

Note this change also fixes some typos as well as
a number of templates that had VLANs with device:
entries which were ignored.

When a user doesn't match the policy rules of a panel then the panel tab
is removed from the menu of the left, but panel views are still
accessible using directly the url (ex /admin/flavors/).

In most of the case, views won't work correctly because of the lack of
right in the backend, but it may cause trouble when you play with
policies.

I think it could be more elegant to return directly a ""You are not
authorized to access this page"" from the frontend when user try to
access a view of a panel (via url) without matching the policy rules.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

Currently when deploying with TLS for internal API traffic, Neutron is
not configured to securely communicate with OVSDB.  In regular OVS agent
deployments OVS listens on ptcp and accepts any incoming connection.  In
ODL deployments OVS is configured to only listen for pssl connections.
To allow Neutron agents to communicate with OVSDB in pssl, Neutron needs
to be configured with SSL key/certificate in order to connect to OVS.

This patch adds key/certificate generation for NeutronBase service to be
consumed by any agent.  The only agent required with ODL is DHCP, so
this patch only addresses configuring SSL there.  However, a future
patch could enable SSL for default ML2/OVS agent deployments as well by
building off of this change.

Note, by default OVSDB listens on port 6640.  This does not work in ODL
deployments when ODL is on the control node because ODL also listens
on port 6640.  Therefore from the ODL service, the ovsdb_connection
setting for DHCP agent is modified when ODL is deployed.

Previously, SchedulerReportClient.set_inventory_for_provider used this
logic to pre-create custom resource classes found in the input
inventory.

        list(map(self._ensure_resource_class,
                 (rc_name for rc_name in inv_data
                  if rc_name not in fields.ResourceClass.STANDARD)))

...where _ensure_resource_class would always attempt to create the
resource class it was given, and raise an exception if that failed for
any reason.  Note in particular that attempting to create an
already-extant ""standard"" resource class will fail just the same as
attempting to create any nonexistent resource class that doesn't conform
to the schema (i.e. beginning with ""CUSTOM_"").

The problem is that this relies on the local system's notion of the set
of standard resource classes. If the placement service is running newer
code, standard resource classes may have been added that the compute
service doesn't know about yet.

This change set solves the problem by only attempting to create resource
classes with the 'CUSTOM_' prefix.

self._ensure_resource_class (which worked on a single resource class) is
replaced with self._ensure_resource_classes (plural) which accepts a
list of *all* the desired resource classes (including the standard
ones), filters down to the CUSTOM_* ones, and attempts to create the
remainder.

Note that if placement ever decides to start allowing creation of
resource classes with prefixes other than CUSTOM_, it will have to do so
under a new microversion, so we can't future-proof this by e.g.
prefetching all the known resource classes from placement and attempting
to create any not found in that list.

In the process of doing this rework, obsolete code paths relying on
pre-1.7 placement microversions are removed.

With modern servers it's not uncommon to see environments that has
dozens of logical processors. Glance defaults workers to number of
these logical processors seen by OS and each worker spins up pool
of 1000 threads. Having dozens of these thread pools consuming
resources is total overkill for most of the environments.

This change limits the amount of workers used by default to 8 which
should be plenty for most of the deployments. This limitation does
not affect if more workers is specifically configured in the config
file.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements

* Changed podManagementPolicy to parallel in order to allow recovery
  from secondary or third master

  After rebooting the whole cluster on purpose or after a power failure
  a primary node the cluster can synchronize with is required. This is
  usually done automatically by selecting the node with the highest
  transaction id. The current implementation of the stateful set starts
  the nodes in sequence, preventing the start of further nodes if the
  process terminates with error state. Because of this, the cluster may
  not come up if the first or second node are not in primary state.

* Elects first node started in primary state as bootstrap source.
* Display warnings and runs mysqld with wsrep-recover on crashed nodes
* Introduces FORCE_RECOVERY argument for crash recovery

  In case the primary selection failed, the cluster bootstrap process
  must be manually initiated from the most advanced node (highest
  committed transaction id). This information is available from the
  grastate.dat file in case of a clean shutdown. On crashed nodes an
  InnoDB recovery is required to get the last committed transaction id.

  start.sh will handle both cases and gives instructions on how to
  recover the cluster on a hard failure. If FORCE_RECOVERY was set to
  the name of a POD (mariadb-0, mariadb-1, ...), the bootstrap process
  will be initiated from the specified node.

Ideally, nodepool will be updated to support shared configuration in

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the

As resource provider handling has evolved, it has become clear that
virt drivers may wish to manage a complex collection of interrelated
resource providers, resource class, traits and aggregates. Some of
those entities may need to be managed by multiple threads of
processing, including different nova-compute processes.

The `generation` concept in the placement service provides a tool
for managing these kinds of concurrent operations: a write API
request that includes a generation has that generation compared against
the value on the server. If there is a match the request can go
ahead, otherwise a ``409 Conflict`` response is returned.

This functionality is not present when associating or disassociating
a resource provider with one or more aggregate uuids. For virt drivers
that wish to manage aggregate associations safely, this is necessary.
This spec describes the changes necessary to add the functionality.

In fullstack test test_dscp_marking_packets two fake hosts are
created, each of them has got one fake instance (called sender and
receiver).
Instance called ""sender"" sends ICMP packets to instance called
""receiver"". In receiver's namespace tcpdump process is spawned with
filter to match only packets marked with specified DSCP value.
After sender instance successfully pings receiver, tcpdump process
is killed and stdout from it was examined to search logged ICMP
packets which were send from sender's IP to receiver's IP address.
That check was failing sometimes as is described in bug report.

It was failing when tcpdump doesn't capture any packets so there was
nothing on stdout from it. But even in such case tcpdump reports on
stderr summary of packets and it was like below:

0 packets captured
6 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel

which means that packets matching our filter was received by tcpdump but
were probably not processed yet. See [1] for more details.

So this patch changes filter used in tcpdump and way how its output is
checked.
Now in filter expression there are added src and dst IP addresses also so
it will match only packets send from sender instance to receiver instance.
After that tcpdump's stderr output is examined with regex to check if
line like:

X packets received by filter

is there and if X value is different than 0. If so, it means that
tcpdump received packets with wanted DSCP mark and test should pass.

In the run devstack role we specify a path to devstack_early_log then
hand it to stack.sh as a parameter which stack.sh does nothing with.
While looking at a fix for this it was pointed out that these early logs
make it into the job's output log now so we don't need a special file
for them. Rather than handle this as a special case just let the
job-output.txt log file pick up the logs for us which allows us to
remove this unneeded feature.

With modern servers it's not uncommon to see environments that has
dozens of logical processors. Glance defaults workers to number of
these logical processors seen by OS and each worker spins up pool
of 1000 threads. Having dozens of these thread pools consuming
resources is total overkill for most of the environments.

This change limits the amount of workers used by default to 8 which
should be plenty for most of the deployments. This limitation does
not affect if more workers is specifically configured in the config
file.

This introduces a single function to collect devstack logs.  It either
runs once for the devstack case, or twice (once for ""old"" and once for
""new"") in the grenade case.  I've rolled the duplicated parts of the
code, including the testr artificat stuff, into this single function.

The layout is simplified into three distinct phases

1) copy devstack files
2) copy generic system logs/status
3) cleanup & compression

I feel this makes the whole process much easier to understand (even
with greatly increased comments diffstat is ~equal), reduces
duplication and reduces the chance that we make mistakes when trying
to introduce various log processing enhancements.

The current check looks for a virtualenv package; but this isn't
portable to other platforms.  In the gate we also have installed from
upstream (to ensure latest) and the package might be on hold, etc
which might mess up the detection.

I think the KISS thing to do is to check for virtualenv and fail with
a useful message.

We call _validate_bdm during instance creation to validate block device
mappings boot indexes, accessibility, attachability, and so on. We need
to query the service version in order to decide which Cinder APIs to
call and because we're in the middle of creating the instance, we
don't yet know which cell it's going to land in.

This changes the service version query to check all cells so that
_validate_bdm will use the 'reserve_volume' Cinder API in a multi-cell
environment. Use of the 'reserve_volume' API is based on the service
version check and without targeting any cells, the service version will
be 0 and we'll use the old 'check_attach' API.

If system time is adjusted first forward and then backward while a
nova service is running (e.g. nova-compute), then there is a high
probability, that periodic tasks will stop for the duration of time
the system clock was adjusted backward.

This was supposed to be fixed by the following patch to oslo.service
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/286838/ , but the order of imports
in unit tests and production code is different, so nova services
end up starting with the default eventlet hub, that does not use a
monotonic clock and, thus, is affected by changes of system time.

Testing this is problematic, as it's a subject of imports order and
is not reproduced in functional or unit tests (oslo_service is always
imported earlier than eventlet hub is initialized, so it just does
""the right thing""). The alternative is to make an assertion when
services start.

Previously it was using functools.wraps() to create the decorators.
The problem is that we can't use the
oslo_utils.reflection.get_signature() function to get the correct
signature.

Change it to use six.wraps() which will add the '__wrapped__'
attribute which will be used when calling get_signature() and return
the signature of the decorated function.

Added unit tests to show we are able to see the signature of a wrapped
function.

This patch reverts the revert of Redis TLS [1], and fixes the
encryption of Redis replication traffic for HA deployments.

In order to encrypt replication traffic, Redis is configured to
drive outgoing replication traffic to a stunnel endpoint on
<localhost:port_xxx>. Stunnel then manages the encryption up to
the peer Redis master.

Likewise, slave Redis nodes advertise themselves as coming from
<localhost:port_yyy> in order to let the Master initiate connection
the Slave over its own stunnel endpoint, should it needs to.

Each redis node is assigned a unique replication port, and has
dedicated stunnels to each one of its peer. This port mapping
info is used by the redis resource agent to manage A/P failover.

The regular Redis port is unchanged, so Redis clients (OpenStack
services, HAproxy, CLI, firewall) are not impacted by this change.
Only SELinux needs to be adapted.

At some point, we've removed the instance snapshot lock, allowing
destroy requests to proceed immediately. We assumed that this
should be fine as long as we're stopping pending WMI jobs.

The issue is that the snapshot operation is still not fully
preemptive. VHD related operations (e.g. copy, merge, upload to
glance) are not preemptive at the moment, for which reason
destroy requests will fail due to file locks.

Unless the new 'force_destroy_instances' config option is enabled
(disabled by default), we're locking the destroy/snapshot operations.

Cruz,sombrafam,"NetApp ONTAP: Copy offload bugfix

When 'NetApp NFS Copy Offload' tool is configured to download Glance
images, these images are downloaded twice because the tool is doing
the job after Cinder has already done it.
This patch fixes the bug by executing the copy offload tool inside the
clone_image function instead of using the copy_image_to_volume.

This moves the legacy-tempest-dsvm-neutron-nova-next-full
job from openstack-zuul-jobs in-tree and updates a
few things since it's now branch specific:

- The cells v2 and placement stuff can be removed since those
  are required now (they were optional when this job would run
  against newton changes).
- Use nova/gate/post_test_hook.sh rather than the symlink under
  nova/tools/hooks/.

The job is currently non-voting and needs to remain that way
until bug 1747511 is fixed.

According to the branch restrictions in project-config, apparently
this job is only running against stable/newton (which no longer
exists) and master, presumably when master was pike. We should also
run this job against stable/pike for the service user test coverage
and post_test_hook.sh run, so we'll likely backport this change
to stable/pike as well.

The related project-config change is:

We should override the 'auth_type' to 'none' when using the old way of
setting up authentication with 'auth_strategy' so we can override the
default 'auth_type' value before getting the session information.
This fixes the following issue

This also adds a new testcase to test the strategy='noauth' scenario.

The Windows connectors do not include the 'device_info' argument
in the 'disconnect_volume' method.

This wasn't an issue for Nova as the Hyper-V driver doesn't pass
this argument, yet Cinder does pass it, which will lead to an
exception.

This change adds the missing argument, defaulting to ""None"" so that
it won't break the Nova Hyper-V driver.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

We faced issue where on some environments docker-puppet.py picks up
/etc/hosts as modified, even though that shouldn't be the case (LP bug
1709689). On the last occasion we found the cause to be desynced time
on the host machine of a virtual setup, and subsequent NTP sync of
overcloud nodes (causing a 5 hour skip back in time) racing with
docker-puppet.py.

Still, more info to debug these kinds of issues would be nice to
have. Printing the timestamp of origin_of_time, saving it to a
persistent directory and making sure /etc/localtime is mounted into
docker-puppet containers should make finding the root cause on such
occasions easier.

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the

These tests are susceptible to a race condition:
  - JournalPeriodicProcessorTest.test_handle_sighup_gracefully
  - JournalPeriodicProcessorTest.test_reset_called_on_sighup

The race condition happens when the worker is SIGHUP before both the signal
processing is registered and the worker is started. In that case there
is no handle by the IPC set by the mock and therefore the testing
process timeouts waiting for the event to happen.

This patch removes the time element from the test by making it event
based.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

This reverts commit 541f04e54683547182580ced58adfcdb2c920043 and
implements a more targeted solution.

Unfortunately this implementation's of a try/rescue system which
will always fail the try on a fresh system causes a lot of confusion
for anyone new to OSA. When seeing the reported failed task the
user thinks something went wrong, even though it was working as
designed.

The main.yml uses a conditional include for the execution of these
tasks only if the current swap available < 1MB. This should be enough
to prevent the tasks executing again. If they do execute again, then
the task to enable swap is now fully idempotent too, so the reason
for the initial implementation is also solved.

The way how Trove is spawning Galera cluster with

In MariaDB 10.1 the mariadb@bootstrap.service

MariaDB recommends to use ""galera_new_cluster""
command to bootstrap a Galera cluster.

The fix consists to make mariadb@bootstrap.service
uses galera_new_cluster command.

Due to a few several small connected patches for the

Patch 1:
k8s: Do not start kubelet and kube-proxy on master

Patch [1], misses the removal of kubelet and kube-proxy from

Patch 2:
k8s: Set require-kubeconfig when needed

From kubernetes 1.8 [1] --require-kubeconfig is deprecated and
in kubernetes 1.9 it is removed.

Closes-Bug: #1718926

https://review.openstack.org/#/c/534309/

Patch 3:
k8s_fedora: Add RBAC configuration

* Make certificates and kubeconfigs compatible
  with NodeAuthorizer [1].
* Add CoreDNS roles and rolebindings.
* Create the system:kube-apiserver-to-kubelet ClusterRole.
* Bind the system:kube-apiserver-to-kubelet ClusterRole to
  the kubernetes user.
* remove creation of kube-system namespaces, it is created
  by default
* update client cert generation in the conductor with
  kubernetes' requirements
* Add --insecure-bind-address=127.0.0.1 to work on
  multi-master too. The controller manager on each
  node needs to contact the apiserver (on the same node)
  on 127.0.0.1:8080
