NOTE:
This commit diverges from the original one in Mitaka. In Liberty the
python-hardware library was not originally available on the IPA image.
To avoid breaking people with old images, inspection_extras is changed
to False by default.

All of our sensitive parameters are defaulted to easily predictable
values, which is very bad from a security perspective because we don't
force clients to make sane choices thus risk deploying with the
predictable default values.  tripleoclient supports generating random
values for all of these, so remove the defaults, for non-tripleoclient
usage we can create a developer-only environment with defaults.

we don't need necessarily need to use to sort_index when using
set_values because the ts is sorted and the ts passed in may be
sorted (via BoundedTimeSerie). we should sort only when required.

also, it's much more efficient to remove duplicates by leveraging
duplicated() vs groupby(level=0).last()[1]

this patch also uses drop rather than overly complicated double slice
and merging that was happening previously.

we don't need necessarily need to use to sort_index when using
set_values because the ts is sorted and the ts passed in may be
sorted (via BoundedTimeSerie). we should sort only when required.

also, it's much more efficient to remove duplicates by leveraging
duplicated() vs groupby(level=0).last()[1]

this patch also uses drop rather than overly complicated double slice

increased the haproxy timeout and inserted some debug tasks into the
tempest_resources playbook. These revealed that the cause of the failure
is glance getting a 400 response from the cirros mirror when doing a
head request to ascertain the size of the image.

I cannot find fault with the OSA mechanisms and suspect the fault is an
intermittent one with the remote server. In which case we don't have
many options apart from to retry, which is what this patch does.

Currently, in sriov setup VFs doesn't get cleaned up after
port deletion. Specifically, MAC and VLAN configuration that
was previously assigned stays untouched and gets changed
only next time when this device will be allocated.

This could lead to unexpected results, for example, user could
create a port with MAC address of some deleted port, but as
the VF of that specific deleted port wasn't cleaned up, user
could end up with two VFs with the same MAC address for example.

To fix that, make LibvirtGenericVIFDriver.unplug_hw_veb explictly
reset MAC and VLAN configurtion for NIC_TYPE_DIRECT type of ports
using the linux_net.set_vf_interface_vlan helper.

Also, modify linux_net.set_vf_interface_vlan to accept set_state
keyword argument that is True by default to keep the existing
behaviour. When set_state is set to False, the 'ip link set $dev up/down'
command will not be executed.

The reason for this is that the Neutron sriov-nic-agent already
manages VFs state, and, additionally, not all SRIOV drivers support
state control.

This splits the upgrade script delivery out of the UpgradeWorkflow
and into a new task which delivers the upgrade script for
compute and object-storage nodes. This is intended to be the first
part of the upgrades process, since we need to upgrade swift nodes
before the controllers and then only one at a time. So this will
deliver the upgrade script which can be invoked by the operator
using the existing script in tripleo-common
'upgrade-non-controller.sh'.

This can be invoked by passing the -e
environments/major-upgrade-script-delivery.yaml (added here) to
the openstack overcloud deploy command.

they all share one and it will effectively be broken for all but the

GlusterFS has two kind of options:
- regular ones, which are a hardcoded set, and option names
  are verified in ""gluster volume get""
- user ones, whose name matches user.* -- these are
  arbitrarily named, are ignored by ""gluster volume get"" and
  are listed in ""gluster volume info"" output

So far we used ""gluster volume info"" universally, but that,
apart from being cumbersome for regular options, is also
incorrect, as it can't distinguish an unset option name from
an undefined one (querying the former should be treated OK,
querying the second should be treated as error).

- implement querying of regular options with ""gluster volume
  get"" (accepting empty response)
- implement querying of user options with searching ""gluster vol
  info"" data
- verify operations on the XML tree, make tacit XML layout
  assumptions explicit
- implement optional Boolean coercion of values

With this patch, the KVM code uses the same method as VirtualBox. A new
library provides the keyboard scancodes (which differ from VirtualBox)
and the function _keyboard_push_scancode is implemented for KVM, too.

This allows kvm-install_base to use distro_start_installer, and we

- in some host environments, the basedisk network does not come up after

- basedisk build takes about an hour with nested virtualization, but on

This patch provides a mechanism for splitting server log files from
nodes into chunks that correspond to time periods (by default, roughly
from the begin of every script start to the begin of the next script
start).

In order to minimize the resources used for this (compute and storage),
the log_point function uses ls(1) to record the size of interesting
log files. These ls-snapshots are retrieved at the end of a
repeat-test run along with the long files.

A new tool, log_snapshot_split, uses that information to create a
directory for each snapshot. For all observed log files, each directory
contain the files and lines written since the previous ls-snapshot.

The whole tool chain can be called manually but is automatically used
by repeat-test.sh.

When calling get_token() there are many assumptions on the
domain when user_domain_id or user_domain_name and
project_domain_id or project_domain_name are not specified.
This is okay when running tempest against devstack, since
the user is in the default domain but in productions the
test user is rarely in the default domain. Instead we should
also pass user_domain_id or user_domain_name and
project_domain_id or project_domain_name to
get_token to create a token.

If there is a case where user_domain_id is None when passed
to get_token() the previous functionality still takes into effect.
Assuming the user is in the 'Default' domain.

If we use unicode as resource name or parameter,
we are likely to encounter unicode problems.
This patch aims to fix unicode problems, and
there are several things to be clear:

1. For the class wrap with six.python_2_unicode_compatible, in
python2 their original __str__ function will map to __unicode__,
and new __str__ function comes from __unicode__.encode.
So we should always return unicode in __str__() if wrap
with python_2_unicode_compatible.

2. python_2_unicode_compatible will not handle __repr__,
__repr__ should return str in all versions of python.

Currently, StackResource loads the whole stack when checking for status
(in check_*_complete method), but only care about the state of the
stack. This is a fairly expensive operation, as it retrieves the
template and reparses everything. This simplifies it with a new API that
simply query the stack status from the database.

It's a resource-consuming task to implement full-flow (up to getting
and reading a dump file) functional test for trigger-crash-dump.
We need to upload Ubuntu image for booting an instance based on it,
and to install kdump with its further configuring on this instance.

Here, the ""light"" version of functional test is proposed.
It's based on knowledge that trigger-crash-dump uses a NMI injection,
and when the 'trigger-crash-dump' operation is executed,
instance's kernel receives the MNI signal, and an appropriate
message will appear in the instance's log.

Wait_for_server_os_boot() method has been added to ClientTestBase
to check if instance's operating system  is completely booted.

The _create_server() method has been removed since the change
which puts this method to the base test class has been merged.

At the moment, this test is part of the 'skip_scenario_test_list'.
There are two reasons for this:
1. At the moment multi-region setups are not possible in devstack-gate.
   Because of this it is currently not possible to run this test at the
   gate.

2. As the README states, the defaults of the tests should match running
   against a recent DevStack. A usual DevStack installation does only
   consist of a single region. Logically, this test requires multiple
   regions to work and would therefore fail in a normal DevStack
   environments.

The commit 7ffa1d58ce9fd9e32cdab142a1f12feae38c3097 added support to
configure nodes with ipmitool drivers in DevStack ironic to run with
virtual machines. The main goal of that patch was to allow us to test
the production ipmitool drivers in the gate replacing the *_ssh testing
drivers in the future.

Later a patch to project-config 2e577710e975983b594f6df59b504b4cae85e594
added two new jobs to the ironic gate: pxe_ipmitool and agent_ipmitool.

This patch contains the final pieces to enable ipmitool drivers to run
on gate.

patch moves L7Policy validations much sooner in the update process
(ie. we catch them at the API), and otherwise reorganizes most of
the L7Policy validation code into the common validations file both so
that it can be called from various locations in the code base, and
so that we can have an easier time unit testing the validation code.

The minus signs have been removed from if and endif blocks so that
whitespace is kept intact between sections. The ordering of post-up and
post-down commands has also been changed so that iptables rules are
created before the dnsmasq service is started, as they were previously.

The default value of lxc_net_gateway has also been changed to null so

This code was originally written for Nova by Joe Gordon
<joe.gordon0@gmail.com> and Sean Dague <sean@dague.net>.

This enables debug logging that is exercised by unit test
runs to be handled and detect formatting errors. The debug
logging does not actually go to the console unless the
OS_DEBUG environment variable is set.

As a result, a few formatting errors are detected and
cleaned up with this change.

This also fixes a problem where debug logging from stevedore
is dumped to the console every time an extension is loaded,
which in a gate-cinder-python27 job is 65K+ times.

Add Consistency Group support to the E-Series driver. This
implementation utilizes the native Consistency Group feature
available on the E-Series backend to support Cinder
Consistency Groups.

CGs and standalone snapshots both utilize snapshot groups.
There is a limit of 3 snapshot groups per volume, so the number
of standalone snapshots will be limited by the number of
consistency groups that are created, and likewise the reverse.
Each CG/Snapshot Group will support up to 32 snapshots, so each
CG that a volume is a part of will reduce the number of available
standalone snapshots that can be created by 32 (from a maximum
of 96).

This patch includes changes relative to integrating Heka with
Elasticsearch and Kibana.

The main change is the addition of an Heka ElasticSearchOutput plugin
to make Heka send the logs it collects to Elasticsearch.

Since Logstash is not used the enable_elk deploy variable is renamed
to enable_central_logging.

If enable_central_logging is false then Elasticsearch and Kibana are
not started, and Heka won't attempt to send logs to Elasticsearch.

By default enable_central_logging is set to false. If
enable_central_logging is set to true after deployment then the Heka
container needs to be recreated (for Heka to get the new
configuration).

The Kibana configuration used property names that are deprecated in
Kibana 4.2. This is changed to use non-deprecated property names.

Previously logs read from files and from Syslog had a different Type
in Heka. This is changed to always use ""log"" for the Type. In this
way just one index instead of two is used in Elasticsearch, making
things easier to the user on the visualization side.

The HAProxy configuration is changed to add entries for Kibana.
Kibana server is now accessible via the internal VIP, and also via
the external VIP if there's one configured.

The HAProxy configuration is changed to add an entry for
Elasticsearch. So Elasticsearch is now accessible via the internal
VIP. Heka uses that channel for communicating with Elasticsearch.

Note that currently the Heka logs include ""Plugin
elasticsearch_output"" errors when Heka starts. This occurs when Heka
starts processing logs while Elasticsearch is not yet started. These
are transient errors that go away when Elasticsearch is ready. And
with buffering enabled on the ElasticSearchOuput plugin logs will be
buffered and then retransmitted when Elasticsearch is ready.

Earlier, when we wanted to log a message with an object as a parameter,
obj_attr_is_set method used to check name parameter, which was a wrong
approach. The reason was, that the oslo logger, when received a
versioned object as a resource parameter, is trying to get the 'name'
parameter, which is a property, so the obj_attr_is_set method will
return False and the logger will try to get the 'type' parameter, which
does not exist in some versioned objects (please take a look at
oslo.logging code [1]).

Now, when the parameter's name is present in obj_extra_fields
dict, we avoid calling obj_attr_is_set and simply get() it.

The other cause was a difference between fields names: size (in volume
object) and volume_size (in snapshot object), and inproper condition
statement in lvm driver.

When qemu-img is called with oslo_concurrency.process_utils.execute
the ProcessExecutionError was raised when qemu-img either fails to
execute or has a non-zero exit code. This error did not propagate
up to the compute manager with any meaningful information meaning
that if an instance build fails the error message is the generic
""There are not enough hosts available"".

This change captures ProcessExecutionError and re-raises the
exception as either InvalidDiskInfo (in qemu_img_info) or
ImageUnacceptable (in convert_image and fetch_to_raw) and makes the
manager accept this as a cause for a BuildAbortException on the
logic that if the image is bad, things are dire, let's bail.

Based on the code in qemu_img_info it appears there was a
misunderstanding of how process_utils.execute behaves so it seems
likely this problem is present elsewhere in the code. This change
attempts to only address the issue as it shows up on the new
instance path described in the related bug.

Similar to what Cinder did here [1], this patch mocks time.sleep
to make tests run faster. Some code actually measure the wall clock
to wait for a specific duration before raising a TimeoutError, so
we also need to mock time.time.

This removes ~5sec in unit test and also removes some busy waiting.

As was pointed out on the original review[1] that introduced it, the
language about unique stack names becoming available again only after an
""unspecified amount of time"" is not based on any actual restriction that
exists in Heat. Stacks are soft-deleted and therefore available to query
(by UUID) even after they have been deleted until such time as they are
purged from the database (an interval which is controlled by the operator,
and hence could be considered unspecified), but the name becomes available
as soon as the delete has successfully completed.

In order to ensure that builds are repeatable (ie the result is
always the same when building from a tag), the repo server's
packages must make use of OpenStack's upper-constraints file
for its own packages.

This patch ensures that this happens, and implements the

This change adds a new set of network templates with IPv6 subnets
that can be used instead of the existing IPv4 networks. Each network
can use either the IPv4 or IPv6 template, and the Neutron subnet will
be created with the specified IP version.

The default addresses used for the IPv6 networks use the fd00::/8
prefix for the internal isolated networks (this range is reserved
for private use similar to 10.0.0.0/8), and 2001:db8:fd00:1000::/64
is used as an example default for the External network
(2001:db8::/32 are the documentation addresses [RFC3849]), but this
would ordinarily be a globally addressable subnet. These
parameters may be overridden in an environment file.

This change will require updates to the OpenStack Puppet
Modules to support IPv6 addresses in some of the hieradata values.
Many of the OPM modules already have IPv6 support to support IPv6
deployments in Packstack, but some OPM packages that apply only to
Instack/TripleO deployments need to be updated.

IPv6 addresses used in URLs need to be surrounded by brackets in
order to differentiate IP address from port number. This change
adds a new output to the network/ports resources for
ip_address_uri, which is an IP address with brackets in the case
of IPv6, and a raw IP address without brackets for IPv4 ports.
This change also updates some URLs which are constructed in Heat.

This has been tested and problems were found with Puppet not
accepting IPv6 addresses. This is addressed in the latest Puppet.
Additional changes were required to make this work with Ceph.

IPv6 tunnel endpoints with Open vSwitch are not yet supported
(although support is coming soon), so this review leaves the
Tenant network as an isolated IPv4 network for the time being.

The packaging module has become large and complex module containing many
different functional features. Long term support and maintenance is
significantly impacted.

The packaging module has been refactored into the following:

    common - utility functions imported by several modules
    git - all the git related functions
    requirements - all the requirements processing functions
    package cmds (aligned to how setuptools and distribute are defined)
        build_doc
        egg_info
        install
        install_scripts
        sdist
        test

The dependencies and test cases have been updated to point to the new
modules except for version. A separate refactoring of version will be
handled in a different patch, at which point the packaging module can
be deprecated and/or removed.

Worker script (worker.py) is introduced. Per port
processing will run this script in a child process
context and returns the result to parent process.
For every new port addition a new short living
process will be created and on completion it will
be killed.

add_to_security_group_map() & remove_from_security_group_map()
is introduced to operate on security group map from

After child process is spawned the parent will record an entry in its cache
and _update_worker_port_list() method will clear the entry from the cache
or will a trigger retry.

2. _update_worker_port_list() method will also update the security group

Our ssh tests for cinder assume that ssh calls will return
immediately, however, if there is a fundamental network issue (like a
bad mtu). We'll get long hangs here (up to 15 minutes). This can turn
this 30 second test into hours.

We can be more aggressive in both timing out an individual command as
well as keeping track of time better.

Where to put a new test ? Is this behavior covered yet ? These and
other questions require understanding the test coverage to be answered.

test_backend.py is a huge test file, making it hard to understand what
cases are currently covered for each backend.

This chain of changes proposes to split it by the backends it covers;
the tests will be placed into 'unit/{backend}/test_backends.py'.

This change splits the tests for the assignment backend.

As Mitaka implments snapshot backup function, created_at
shows when backups are created, and data_timestamp shows
time when data are taken from volumes.

This patch adds data_timestamp as a sort item, so that
customers can list backups sorted by data_timestamp. As
a result, they can know which backup has latest data.

Previous change Ie54fd2b205c7ffae90dc960dfe0bfc46f952a8d8 performed
coordinated LU upload to an SSP using an algorithm that assumed it was
possible to rename an existing Logical Unit.  This turns out not to be
the case.

This change set makes a second attempt at coordinated LU upload by
creating a specially-named LU that acts as a marker indicating that the
upload (to the LU with the real, final name) is not yet complete.  The
marker LU is removed when the upload is finished.  The other aspects of
the coordination algorithm are similar:

- Check whether the LU already exists.  (Now this is indicated by the
  presence of the LU with the final name, and NO marker LUs.)  If so,
  return it.
- Check whether an upload is in progress.  (Now this is indicated by the
  presence of any marker LU, whether or not the LU with the real name
  has been created yet.)  If so, spin and wait for it to complete.
- Create a marker LU.
- Pull back the LU list and see if anyone else created a marker and/or
  started the upload while we were creating our marker.
- If someone else started an upload, delete our marker, and spin waiting
  for it to complete.
- If we have multiple markers, alpha-sort them by name.  The first one
  wins.  If it's someone else, delete our marker and spin.
- If there was just one marker (ours), or if ours was first in the
  alpha-sort, do the actual upload.
- Remove the marker LU to signal completion.
- Return the LU we uploaded.

networking_topology relies on operating system domain name resolution
to translate host name to IP addresses with the purpose of looking for
compute node networking capabilities parsing network topology provided
by OpenDaylight.

Networking ODL uses requests library to connect to OpenDaylight and
download the network topology from OpenDaylight.

Some tests doesn't expect it and they could actually have success doing
one of above operations when a failure is expected. In such case the
behaviour of networking_topology would be different from the one expected
at the moment unit tests has been written.

Starting with Mitaka, Neutron API handing of default subnetpool has
changed [1].

If a default subnetpool exists in Neutron it will show up in the
subnetpool list. Thus no change in Horizon is needed to handle this
part.

The following changes are required in Horizon:
- Mark the 'default_ipv4_subnet_pool_label' and
  'default_ipv6_subnet_pool_label' configuration options for use
  with Liberty only, deprecate them and tag them for removal in
  future release.
- When the configuration options are removed the _check_subnet_data
  function should no longer allow to pass empty 'cidr' and
  'subnetpool_id'.

The 2.16 microversion added the host_status extended
server attribute which relies on the instance.services field.

The primary join in the database for that field is dependent on
the instance not being deleted.

When listing deleted instances at microversion>=2.16, the
compute API attempts to lazy-load the instance.services field
which fails with an InstanceNotFound because the instance
is deleted.

In this case, it's best to just set instance.services to an
empty ServiceList when lazy loading the services field on a
deleted instance since the DB object won't have any value for
the services attribute anyway.

The API supports listing of user by name but keystone client
does not. It was required by a user in some scenario(as
described in bug description).

To supporting this feature, the user option needs to be added for
help and displaying to user.

do_user_list method uses list method of user.py, which needs to be
updated according to the keystone API. In the case of list of users,
keystone returns a dictionary having 'users' as key and list of
all users as the value. But in case of display by name, we get,
a dictionary having 'user' as key and user details as value.
Which makes it necessary to pass 'user' as reponse key.

In base.py's _list method, in our case, we get a dictionary, which
needs to be converted to list before proceeding further. On the
basis of response_key, this decision is being made.

A Calico network is not bridged across all the involved compute hosts,
and therefore requires a different DHCP provision approach from the
standard Neutron ones, which provide DHCP for all instances on a
Neutron Network from a single DHCP agent located on the 'network
node'.  (Or from a few DHCP agents, for HA.)  For Calico thus far, the
approach we've taken is to run a DHCP agent on each compute host.

It turns out, though, that (with more than about a couple of hundred
compute hosts) the agent/server RPC communications place too much load
on the Neutron server(s), such that the Neutron servers become
unresponsive to Nova when the latter is trying to bring up a new VM;
and hence new VM creations fail.  For more details, see the referenced
bug.

In Calico we already have another mechanism for communicating between
the controller and compute nodes - the distributed etcd database - and
this mechanism already includes almost all the information that is
needed for DHCP provision.  Therefore we can avoid the problem in
scaling of the Neutron RPC mechanism by creating and using an
etcd-driven DHCP agent instead.

This commit contains the following consequent changes.

- Add a Calico-specific top-level DHCP agent class and executable
  script, like the Neutron analogs but driven by etcd data instead of
  by Neutron RPC.  (For more detailed design see
  doc/source/dhcp-agent.rst.)

- Update the Calico DevStack plugin so that it runs the Calico DHCP
  agent instead of the reference Neutron DHCP agent.

- Revert a recently added optimization in
  networking_calico/agent/linux/dhcp.py that limits the config that is
  fed to Dnsmasq to be only what is needed for the local compute host
  (as opposed to for all ports on all compute hosts).  This is now not
  needed, as the etcd mechanism already limits the information that it
  processes to what is relevant on the local compute host.

- Enhance the Calico mechanism driver so that it writes per-subnet
  information, that the DHCP agent needs, into etcd.  Specifically
  this means, for each subnet:

  - the subnet CIDR

  - any DNS servers that are configured for the subnet.

  Previously there was no subnet-scope data in Calico's etcd data
  model.

- Enhance the Calico mechanism driver so that it writes additional
  information that the DHCP agent needs for each endpoint, namely:

  - for each fixed IP, which subnet it is associated with

  - the FQDN that has been configured for the endpoint, if any.

- Related new and updated testing.

a current set of critical packages to ensure that each SHA bump
includes an update to a current version of pip, setuptools and
wheel but also to ensure that they are pinned to a specific version
with this particular set of packages.

This ensures that we keep current with these packages as they
change, but also ensures that the versions tested for each tag are
the versions used forever.

The patch also ensures that any package installed by pip is upgraded
to the expected versions.

This is a combined backport of:
 - https://review.openstack.org/284701
 - https://review.openstack.org/284977
 - https://review.openstack.org/287700
 - https://review.openstack.org/287739

Backport notes:
 - https://review.openstack.org/283039 is reverted as the pinning
   is now handled properly elsewhere.
 - The pip pinning done via global-requirements in
   https://review.openstack.org/270312 is removed.
 - The versions pinned are the versions used at the time of the
   last rpc-repo build. This is to ensure that this tag implements
   the same version of all the packages used as the time the tag
   repo was built.
 - The SHA for the requirements repository is updated in order to
   include the caps for osprofiler and testtools.

for volume attachment are auto-generated.
