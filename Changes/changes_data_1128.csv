Since `project_endpoint_group` has a foreign key reference with `endpoint_group`
thus, if we want to remove endpoint_group we need to remove associated
`project_endpoint_group` at first.

The testcase provided can pass even without code changing only beacuse SQLITE
didn't enforce foreign key constraint by default, so endpoint group with project
association can be deleted (needn't delete project association at first)
successfully.

Currently keystone will run one flush per controller, which leads to
excessive churn and rollbacks, which can be disruptive to service.

This uses gearman to have the least-busy controller run the flush. It
still may run into problems if the flush takes longer than four hours
but the cleanup script _should_ be exitting before that time is up.

Note that this will also require changes in the Heat templates to pass
the control Virtual IP in as a gearman.address

As both Ubuntu and the MariaDB repositories carry packages with the same
names, apt package pinning is required to ensure that the packages we install
come from the right repository. This patch adds a pinning preference file to
ensure that the packages we install come from the MariaDB repository.

Due to the OpenStack CI images having conflicting packages installed in the
base image, this patch also includes the removal of these packages during the
AIO bootstrap to ensure that the deployment succeeds.

For environments where the same two packages are installed on the hosts prior
to the deployment of os-ansible-deployment, they would need to ensure that the
packages are removed first. This has been seen in environments where
monitoring tooling has installed the packages as a dependancy.

Also, the swift installation process requires access to the Ubuntu backports
repository to install the liberasurecode1 and liberasurecode-dev packages. In
the hpcloud environments used in OpenStack-CI the backport repository is not
implemented, so we need to ensure that it's there if it hasn't already been
configured. This patch does that as part of the AIO bootstrap process.

Finally, this patch also updates the global requirements and the sha's for all
openstack branches that we're pinned to.

service.py had some code where the child process would catch the
SIGTERM from the parent just so it could exit with 1 status rather
than with an indication that it exited due to SIGTERM. When
shutting down the parent doesn't care in what way the child ended,
only that they're all gone, so this code is unnecessary.

Also, for some reason this caused the child to never exit while
there was an open connection from a client. Probably something
with eventlet and signal handling.

Ironic has deprecated per-flavor ramdisk and kernel image IDs in favor
of setting them per-node. These parameters are optional to preserve
backward compatibility. For ease of use, the command line client takes
the kernel and ramdisk name and looks up the ID via glance. Also, they
are completely ignored on nova-bm since it does not have a per-node
setting for these ids.

This avoids us leaving the filter in the global lvm config. Without cleaning
this up, we can hit some failures to run stack.sh because devices are excluded
that we need to be able to see. This resets it to what it was before when
we do a cleanup.

Also, do this before we add the line, so we don't add multiple lines on

eventlet 0.17.3 is the first release fully compatible with Python 3 when
eventlet is used with monkey-patching. It is required to port OpenStack
to Python 3. For example, Oslo Messaging test suite now pass with
eventlet 0.17.3. Currently, eventlet is disabled on Python 3 in Oslo
Messaging, which prevents many applications to be ported to Python 3.

More information on the project to port OpenStack to Python 3:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Python3

Moreover, eventlet 0.17.2 includes a change to use a real logger
interface, so it makes possible to cleanup oslo.log (more information in
the bug #1440773).

are not installed together OpenStack server projects.

While the syncing of requirements is nice, it's not essential that
Documentation repo are part of requirements. The Documentation
repos have additional unique dependencies that are not needed by
other projects.

Still, the Documentation team likes to ensure that their requirements
are not conflicting with global requirements to allow editors and
developers reuse environments.

As discussed with Documentation team, remove these repositories
now (see thread starting at

This commit completes work that was discussed during the OSSG mid-cycle.

Summarizing the major changes:
 - Result 'severity' has been moved from INFO/WARN/ERROR to a LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
scale.  This, as previously, is intended to indicate the risk associated with
the issue being reported.
 - Result 'confidence' has been introduced, also with a LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH scale.
This is intended to allow a plugin writer to indicate their level of confidence
that the issue raised is truly a security problem.
 - A Bandit plugin may now return a result as a 2-tuple (issue_severity,
issue_text) or - optionally - a 3-tuple (issue_severity, issue_confidence,
issue_text).  Confidence will default to UNDEFINED if the plugin does not
return a value.

The commit includes updates across Bandit and plugins to utilize the new scales,
and updates to the associated functional test suite to maintain test coverage.

Additionally, this commit:
 - Modifies the labels on fields included in JSON and CSV output formats to
align with Bandit-internal terminology (likely a breaking change for consumers
of these formats).
 - Removes color output codes from Bandit configuration when not running in a
TTY, as they are not likely to be supported.
 - Adds severity and confidence to the standard Bandit output for each issue.
 - Adds a few more debug statements and includes a traceback when a plugin
fails, to aid in developing plugins.
 - Cleans up the command line arguments used with argparse a little.
 - Fixes PEP8 niggles.

 It does not implement filtering by confidence, that will be a future todo.

As we know, IPs in subnet CIDR are used for
1) Broadcast port
2) Gateway port
3) DHCP port if enable_dhcp is True, or update to True
4) Others go into allocation_pools
Above 1) to 3) are created by default, which means if CIDR doesn't
have that much of IPs, subnet create/update will cause a DHCP resync.

This fix is to add some restricts to the issue:
A) When subnet create, if enable_dhcp is True, /31 and /32
   cidrs are forbidden for IPv4 subnets while /127 and /128 cidrs are
   forbidden for IPv6 subnets.

Currently all the OS::Nova::Server resource created don't pass any
user-data.  It's possible to pass user-data as well as using heat
SoftwareConfig/SoftwareDeployment resources, and this can be useful
when you have simple ""first boot"" tasks which are possible either via
cloud-init, or via simple run-once scripts.

This enables passing such data by implementing a new provider resource
OS::TripleO::NodeUserData, which defaults to passing an empty mime
archive (thus it's a no-op).  An example of non no-op usage is also
provided.

Manual import of Translations from Transifex. This change also removes
all po files that are less than 66 per cent translated since such
partially translated files will not help users.

This updates also recreates all pot (translation source files) to
reflect the state of the repository.

This change needs to be done manually since the automatic import does

This eliminates the second call to get_ports since all of the necessary

oslo.messaging now implements rabbitmq heartbeat.

py-amqp (the underlying low library to connect to rabbitmq) has a
working support of heartbeat since 1.4.0. So we need at least
that version.

Given that Trusty has 3.0.7 of kombu and the authors have indicated
that amqp>=1.3.3,<2.0 would work with that version, we can use
amqp 1.4.0 with kombu 3.0.7.

So this change raises the kombu requirement to '>=3.0.7' and
amqp to '>=1.4.0'

When launching an instance Nova needs to make decisions about how to
configure the virtual hardware. Currently these decisions are often
hardcoded, or driven by nova.conf settings, and sometimes by glance
image properties. The goal of this feature is to allow the user to
specify the guest OS type and then drive decisions from this fact,
using the libosinfo database.

is same as requested object path. It is because
the request will overwrite the segment and then it

Right now if you want to get a single image, two queries need to be
executed:
- Get image + associated locations and properties
- Get associated tags for image

Proposed solution combines these two queries into single one which gets
image and all related data - locations, properties and tags. Similar
pattern has been already implemented when querying for list of images.

Cinder moved to the released lib of oslo.config,
the problem is that the old incubator files were
never removed, and the worst part is that the
genconfig calls were never updated to use the
libs.

As a result we were using the invalid incubator code
to generate sample configs for the last several months.

This change removes the incubator.config code and updates
the genconfig calls to use the libs, which results in a
valid sample.conf being generated again.

We also remove the invalid conf scripts in tools/config

ARP cache poisoning is not actually prevented by the firewall
driver 'iptables_firewall'. We are adding the use of the ebtables
command - with a corresponding ebtables-driver - in order to create
Ethernet frame filtering rules, which prevent the sending of ARP
cache poisoning frames.

The complete patch is broken into a set of smaller patches for easier review.

This patch here is th first of the series and includes the low-level ebtables
integration, unit and functional tests.

    This commit is based greatly on an original, now abandoned patch,

This patch adds a new pre_build_overcloud_images function
that can be used to pre-build all of the overcloud images
before running devtest_overcloud.sh. This allows someone
to build a single overcloud image that can then be used
for all the roles.

The intent is to use this feature in combination with USE_CACHE=1
such that the prebuild images get used by devtest_overcloud.sh.

Also, wires this new feature into the fedora 20 puppet job.

This patch handles that by attempting to convert
each result into an integer and then catching the
exception and continuing through the iteration to
ignore uninitialized ports like these.

If a stack update is cancelled while the update of a nested stack is being
processed, the nested stack update is no longer stopped since the
implementation changed in Kilo to use the RPC API to control nested stacks.

To alleviate this, use the RPC API to cancel the (nested) stack update when
the resource update is cancelled. This results in a rollback of the nested
stack, so if a subsequent attempt to roll back the ensted stack by doing a
stack update fails due to the rollback already being in progress, just
ignore the error and wait for the existing operation to complete.

On some deploys we see /etc/ssh/sshd_config missing a trailing newline,
which breaks the sshd_config file when the lineinfile tasks are run.
This has been traced back to the version of ansible being deployed in
juno as we do not have this issue in later branches using newer
versions of ansible.

Alternatively, we could upgrade ansible in juno but I would prefer to
make the smallest change possible since juno is now widely deployed.

The change introduces a list of template data for node templates and
clusters for each plugin. The first known plugin and its first known
version are used.

At least one default template is added for each plugin, so that all
the real deployment can be covered.

The tests are skipped if the plugins key in tempest configuration is empty;
they fail if no known plugin or no known version for known plugins are found
(which probably means that the test configuration should be updated).

The list must be maintained; on the other way, after some discussions,
the alternative solution - expose all the node group and cluster
templates parameters in tempest configuration - would have made the
testing more random and too dependent on the cloud operator in charge
of running tempest.
The list of plugins is not probably going to change massively for each
release, so it seems feasible.

Revert fix from bug #1329050, which adds a plugin panel to its dashboard's
class. Adding a plugin panel to a dashboard whose class has its panels defined
in a tuple will fail because the new plugin cannot be appended to the tuple.
The code errors out before the panel gets added to the dashboard's panel list.
However, at this point, the panel has already been registered with the
dashboard. This causes Dashboard.get_panels() to see the panel in its registry
but not in its panel groups. Consequently, the panel gets put in the ""Other""
panel group instead of its configured one, as described in bug #1378558.

By not adding the the plugin panel to its dashboard's class, the panel gets
added to its dashboard's panel list. Now the original issue from bug #1329050
resurfaces. The root cause of that is that every time Dashboard._autodiscover()
is called, it instantiates all its panel group classes, wiping out any panels
previously added to any of the panel groups. Avoid this by always processing
all the plugin panel groups before any of the plugin panels, which also ensures
that the panel groups exist before their panels.

Making this change exposed an issue where the Horizon URLs were being loaded
twice during the plugin infrastructure's unit tests, causing plugin panels to
be added multiple times to their dashboards. Fix that by removing the second,
unnecessary call. Also create a second test plugin panel group and panel to
test the scenarios described in the two bugs addressed here, adding two panel
groups at a time.

keepalived.virtual_routes previously held one list of virtual
routes of different kinds, and the HA router class manipulated
that list directly. The list held both the default gateway
virtual route, and any extra routes. This means that when adding
extra routes for example, the HA router would first have to
remove all routes that are not default gateway routes, then add
the extra routes received via RPC.

This is messy because:
a) It's needlessly complicated
b) It's fragile
c) There's zero separation of concerns (HA router should not know
   how keepalived maintains its list of virtual routes)
d) It requires changes to the management of the default gateway
   and virtual routes just to add another type of extra routes

This patch solves these issues by separating the persistency of
virtual routes according to their role.

The package pinning issue in galera is related to how the pref file
or the lack there of is being created. The pref file for apt pinning
needs to be locked down to the release organisation which is providing
the extra packages.

A filter plugin was added to allow for a url to be parsed for the
purpose of pinning to an origin.

The PPA being used for modern rsyslog is exhibiting signs that its
prone to failure. Upon further review the V8 stable PPA is tied
directly to launchpad which is a known failure domain. To correct
this issue the PPA was removed and the additional repo from within
the rsyslog_* roles was made optional.

This is the recommended solution per the upstream mariadb
documentation as found here:
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/installing-mariadb-deb-files/

In the horizon kilo play the package pathlib is required when doing
an offline compress however this package is not a ""requirement""
according to the horizon requirements.txt file though within our
implementation horzion needs this dep.

else. This also creates an origin pin with a pin-priority of 1001
that sets the preference to an apt repositories from a known source
as defined within the repo. These changes will resolve MariaDB
pinning issues while also allowing us the ability to change repos
and ensure that apt does the right thing by not forcably installing
packages that could potentially force a general downgrade of other
system libraries that end up breaking everything from the bottom up.

This is the recommended solution per the upstream mariadb
documentation as found here:
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/installing-mariadb-deb-files/

A filter plugin was added to allow for a url to be parsed for the
purpose of pinning to an origin.

The setup play for safe upgrade that runs first was removed from
host-setup.yml as its not needed and causes an unprecedented
number of gating issues.

Effectively, the following partition changes are made:

because the rpc call can fail due to the network impact.

Add a config option 'update_resources_interval' to be able to set how
often the update_available_resources periodic task should run.

When a single nova-compute is managing a lot of nodes, we need the
ability to tune the frequency of this task.

The default value of 0 means to run on every periodic task interval
(same as current/old behavior). Setting it to a negative value will
prevent it from running at all. Setting it to a positive value will
determine the number of seconds between calls.

DocImpact
This adds a new CONF option 'update_resources_interval' that controls
how often the update_available_resource() method is called.

Manual import of Translations from Transifex. This change also removes
all po files that are less than 66 per cent translated since such
partially translated files will not help users.

This updates also recreates all pot (translation source files) to
reflect the state of the repository.

This change needs to be done manually since the automatic import does
not handle the proposed branches and we need to sync with latest
translations.

Note: This is part of importing of translations, there are no new
translations for this project, thus only the pot file gets updated.

Due to the OpenStack CI images having conflicting packages installed in the
base image, this patch also includes the removal of these packages during the
AIO bootstrap to ensure that the deployment succeeds.

For environments where the same two packages are installed on the hosts prior
to the deployment of os-ansible-deployment, they would need to ensure that the
packages are removed first. This has been seen in environments where
monitoring tooling has installed the packages as a dependancy.

As we know, IPs in subnet CIDR are used for
1) Broadcast port
2) Gateway port
3) DHCP port if enable_dhcp is True, or update to True
4) Others go into allocation_pools
Above 1) to 3) are created by default, which means if CIDR doesn't
have that much of IPs, subnet create/update will cause a DHCP resync.

This fix is to add some restricts to the issue:
A) When subnet create, if enable_dhcp is True, /31 and /32
   cidrs are forbidden for IPv4 subnets while /127 and /128 cidrs are
   forbidden for IPv6 subnets.
B) When subnet update, if enable_dhcp is changing to True and there are no
   more IPs in allocation_pools, the request should be denied.

This allows to verify bonds for deployed nodes and changes verification
algorithm for non-deployed ones.
Now bonds are passed to net_checker for deployed nodes, so it is able
to check the connectivity on bonds when they are configured
(traffic cannot be seen on slave NICs in this case, at least for linux bonds).
For non-deployed nodes slave NICs of bonds are passed to net_checker.
It is checked that at least one of slave NICs of every bond has received
test data.

Additional info (node status, node name, node bonds names and slave NICs) is
also saved into task's message to be able to process net_checker results even
when some nodes were deleted from DB during the verification. It was made to keep
compatibility with previous approach.
We could lock nodes for deletion while they are being checked but it is subject
for another discussion.
