    After rebooting all nodes in the cluster, all the instances that were

    The manager.init_host method is the one that tries to shut off the

    by RPC. But the starting of the RPC server is only done in the
    server.start method, which is called after the init_host is called.
    The RPC message never gets back to nova-compute.

    Moving the cleanup of the instances state to the post_start_hook

While debugging a Tempest race failure it would have
been useful to see when the ports on an instance were
deallocated, especially knowing which ports are unbound
versus which ports are deleted.

This simply adds debug logging of the ports in both
situations.

The unit tests are updated for the conditional checks

This patch implements a new class `Claim` to check resource consumption
in host states, including cpu, ram, disk, numa topology and pci. This
patch encapsulates claim logics into the new Claim inherited from
`nova.compute.claims.Claim`. Also, claim tests are implemented in
test_claims.py to make sure there are no regressions in scheduler.

This patch also ensures that no resources are consumed in the host
state if any of the claims in `HostState.consume_from_request()` fails,
and the scheduler will change to try the second best host. This process
is identical to the claim logic in the compute nodes, so that some host
failing conditions in the compute nodes can be detected as soon as
possible to prevent some expensive retries. Related tests are also
added.

Note `set_update_time_on_success` decorator is removed because the
exception handling is duplicated in `FilterScheduler._select_host()` and
the time update logic is implemented in
`HostState.consume_from_request()` in only 2 lines.

Note test_host_manager.HostStateTestCase.\
test_stat_consumption_from_instance_with_pci_exception is replaced by
test_claims.ClaimTestCase.test_claim_pci_fails because the consumption
will be checked firstly by claims in `host.consume_from_request`.

Current update model of scheduler host state has some issues. First, a
host state cache will be updated even if it is already the same with the
latest db data(i.e. HostState.db_updated = compute.updated_at =
HostState.db_updated). Second, the cache won't be updated even if db
data is newer in a specific case(i.e. HostState.db_updated <
compute.updated_at < HostState.updated).

This patch adds a timestamp to record when a host state cache is updated
by db(HostState.db_updated), and fixes the first issue. This complete
update model covers all 6 possible conditions:
1. compute_db_updated < cache_db_updated/cache_updated   -> return
2. cache_db_updated = cache_updated = compute_db_updated -> return
3. cache_db_updated = compute_db_updated < cache_updated -> return
4. cache_db_updated < compute_db_updated < cache_updated -> return
5. cache_db_updated < compute_db_updated = cache_updated -> update
6. cache_db_updated/cache_updated < compute_db_updated   -> update

However, this patch won't fix the second issue by setting #4 to
'-> update' because it will introduce much more unexpected retries due
to the losses of recent consumptions when refresh the host state,
causing a worse impact from the bug #1341420. A detailed analysis can
be found at https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1341420/comments/24

So the second issue is left unsolved because this leads to less
consumption losses and thus can reduce retries to minimum in
'one scheduler instance per cell' scenario. It should be solved after
consumptions are instantiated by claims during host state consumption,
which will be implemented in bp host-state-level-locking.

This patch also applies to IronicNodeState.

The side effect of not proper cleaning up the network is that VM would
be rescheduled to a different hypervisor with in-compatible network, causing
the VM lose connectivity

Part of the trigger for the issue is that the bridged_network is not compatible
among the candidate compute nodes on retry. The current proposed fix is to
detect the presence of immobile networks (bridge_network in this case), and if
true, call _cleanup_allocated_networks.

Instance events can be sent to a compute host while it is not
currently running. When the compute manager is then started it
receives the events and attempts to handle them.  In this scenario
there will not be any waiters for the event since the manager was
just started.  The current code was sending a debug message saying
the event was received after event processing was cancelled because
it was incorrectly checking 'if not self._events:' which would be
True if self._events is either None or {}.  With None meaning
all events have been cancelled an no further events will be
handled.  This is the shutdown case.  When self._events is {},
it just means there are no waiters for the event.

This changeset adds a check for 'if self._event is None' and
sends the appropriate message only after events have been
cancelled.

Rally scenario snapshot_server may fail occasionally at nova boot.
nova complains about image not ready when Rally tries to boot
a new instance with the snapshot after it waits the snapshot to
become ACTIVE.

When create a snapshot for an instance, VMware driver will create
a temporary VM, then export the root disk to Glance. The temporary
VM and the snapshot will be deleted when the image upload is done,
and the image will set to ACTIVE.

The ACTIVE status of an image is considered to be ready to go to
the next operation to boot a new instance from the image in Rally.

However, exception may be thrown during the cleanup operations.
nova-compute will try to delete the image in case of error.
The image status will be set to ""deleting"" when it happens.

In the mean time, when Rally drives nova to create a new instance
for the image, nova-api will check whether the image status is
""ACTIVE"" but it may just have been set to ""deleting"" which causes
the boot operation to fail.

This commit will omit exceptions during the cleanup to prevent
the image status from changing once the upload is done.

Instance boots that fail during host side volume attachment are not
rescheduled to other hosts.  Host side volume attachment consists
of the get_volume_connector call to the virt driver and the
initialize_connection call to Cinder.  Either of these calls could
fail on host specific issues and could succeed if the instance were
rescheduled to another host.

The fix is to throw a new volume attachment exception if either of
these attachment methods fail and let this exception trigger a
reschedule instead of a BuildAbortException as is currently done.

This evacuation problem can be reproduced with deployment of VM and
corresponding host is shut down immediately before VIF active state in
InstanceInfoCache is updated to True from False for corresponding VM.
By examining compute log on source Host, you can determine if
InstanceInfoCache has been updated to active=True or not.

When such a VM is evacuated to destination host, since vif state is not
active it goes into stale state and any attempt to plug goes nowhere.
This is due to communication is sent to wrong host (source instead of
destination).

This patchset fixes this problem by adding logic to rebuild_instance
method in compute manager. It sets active state of all VIFs in the VM
to true. This is how it will be if VIF state becomes active on source
host before it goes down.

All corresponding unit tests in test_compute and test_compute_mgr have
been updated.

For testing cells, we will need to track the driver instances that
we give out by url. This normally just works with a conventional
oslo.messaging driver, but the fake driver keeps internal data
structures for simulating its bus. If we end up with clients creating
a new instance of the driver in the rpc switching code, we'll never
be able to send messages to services because we'll always have
private/separate data structures.

So, this makes the fixture wrap the transport creation stuff
and unify references by url. In order to make this work, some
retooling of rpc.init() is done, which makes it more in line with
the recent additions we had for wrapping transport initialization
per connection anyway.

For now, a lot of our tests can't handle the possibility of
multiple RPC connections due to them looking at the global
transport_url configuration. So for the moment, even though this
makes the fixture support multiple independent connections, we
collapse any such attempts down to a single connection to the
default broker.

Note: this requires a fix in oslo.messaging 5.14.0

When listing instances in the cellv2 world we look them up
from three locations:

1. Build requests which exist before the instances are created
   in the cell database (after the scheduler picks a host to
   build the instance). Currently instances and build requests
   are both created before casting to conductor, but that's going
   away in Ocata with the support for multiple cellsv2 cells.
2. The cell0 database for instances which failed to get scheduled
   to a compute host (and therefore a cell).
3. The actual cell database that the instance lives in. Currently
   that's only a single traditional nova database, but could be one
   of multiple cellsv2 cells when we add that support in Ocata.

If a marker is passed in when listing instances, if the instance
lives in an actual cell database, we'll get a MarkerNotFound failure
from cell0 because the instance doesn't exist in cell0, but we check
cell0 before we check the cell database. This makes the instance
listing short-circuit and fail with a 400 from the REST API.

This patch simply handles the MarkerNotFound when listing instances
from the cell0 database and ignores it so we can continue onto the
cell database.

Leverage the fact that there is never more than one socket active to

look up active connections.  Also removes the need to query the return
values from select since there is only one socket to process. This
change improves RPC throughput under the simulator by up to 20%

The jinja calculation of the BIRD BGP peer was failing intermittently
when IPv6 connectivity was not present.

Even though the IPv6 deployment was being detected correctly as
disabled by the role, the configuration task was failing to skip
consistently because the IPv6 peer address var could not be
resolved by Jinja.

This fixes the default IPv6 peer calculation to resolve to an empty
string when no IPv6 connectivity is present, which allows the
automatic IPv6 detection to skip the config task.

There is a strange issue with the new image building process in
RDO where the host initramfs is ending up in the undercloud.qcow2,
but the host kernel is not. This initramfs does not match the
kernel from the CentOS cloud image used as a base, but instead is
for a newer kernel. The virt-get-kernel command just takes the
newest kernel and initramfs it can find in /boot/, which in this
case ends up with a mismatch.

Since the new image building process is just a converted
overcloud-full image, we can just copy-out the DIB extracted kernel
and initramfs from the undercloud to use for booting it. DIB seems
to be a bit smarter about how it extracts the kernel and initramfs,
so we do not get the same mismatch.

1.As mentioned in [1], we should avoid using
six.iteritems to achieve iterators. We can
use dict.items instead, as it will return
iterators in PY3 as well. And dict.items/keys

about list should be negligible, see the link [2].

In heatclient, we use the CLI 'heat stack-snapshot' to make a snapshot
of a stack, While we use 'openstack stack snapshot create' instead.
Then ,I think we can use 'heat snapshot-create' in consistent with
OSC CLI. In addition, we also can keep up with the CLI in heatclient
such as: 'heat snapshot-list', 'heat snapshot-delete', 'heat snapshot-show'.
So, it's better to make this change in heatclient.

The current implementation leverages threads and runs the hooks
asynchronously, which is a problem because we can't guarantee the order
of member join/leave. For example if the following happen:

 coord.watch_join_group(x) # takes hours to complete
 coord.watch_leave_group(x) # is very fast
 coord2.join_group(x)
 coord.run_watchers()

It's possible that the callback added in `watch_join_group()' that are
put in the execution queue will be put _after_ the callbacks put by
`watch_leave_group()' and after the watchers are run. That means that
when `run_watchers()' is called, a leave event will be emitted but no
previous join event will be emitted. More, the join event will be
emitted later, putting the system in a wrong state.

This patches drops the async callback push back in queue to run the
common code that is synchronous and serialized and do not have this bug.

The `deleted` column in volume_type_extra_specs was as a boolean;
The same column in share_type_extra_specs is an integer. However,
the code migrating from volume_types to share_types
assumes them to be vice-versa. This breaks downgrading from that
migration.

Further, the `id` column in share_type_extra_specs is a primary key
field of Integer datatype. Such fields have auto-increment turned on
by default; we shouldn't be copying the `id` from
volume_type_extra_specs when we copy the data.

Currently it is impossible to create a location constraint and a
resource in a non racy way. For example it is not currently possible
to do something like the following:
pacemaker::resource::ocf { 'galera-master': ... }
pacemaker::constraint::location_rule { 'location-galera':
  resource           => 'galera-master',
  expression         => 'galera-role eq true',
  resource_discovery => 'exclusive',
}

The reason the above does not work is that after the resource creation
the pacemaker is free to start the resource wherever it wants and this
can break certain deployments. There are two blessed ways to solve this
via pcs:
1) pcs resource create galera-master ... --disabled
   pcs constraint location rule ...
   pcs resource enable galera-master
2) pcs cluster cib > cib.xml
   pcs -f cib.xml resource create galera-master ...
   pcs -f cib.xml constraint location rule ...
   pcs cluster cib-push cib.xml --config

Both approaches have been tried and the first one, with the addition of
a location_rule parameter to all resources seems to be the less
intrusive one (does not break current users and requires little effort
to use). The second approach was prototyped here:

is a historic curiosity, and upstream team does not think about the

This commit proposes PDF generation with pdflatex.
Executing Sphinx with latex option generates .tex files will
be performed first, and pdflatex converts from .tex to .pdf files.

More details are as followings:

- Adds texlive related package binary dependency (>= Trusty)
  : inkscape texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra
    texlive-fonts-recommended
- build-rst.sh: --pdf option is added
- install-guide PDF support using --pdf option
- PDF support for serveral documents
  : arch-design, cli-reference, ha-guide, ops-guide, user-guide,
    networking-guide, arch-design-draft
  (testable using like ""tox -e build -- networking-guide --pdf"")
- Intermidiate files for building .tex (required for converting into
  .pdf) are stored in ""build/pdf"" folder.

Through [1] ipset members are updated in update_security_group_members
instead of updating during firewall apply. In the same way, we will
delete conntrack entries immediately after deleting remote ipset
members(in update_security_group_members) instead of deleting them after
firewall apply.

As explained in [2], this change partially fixes bug #1580377 i.e it
deletes conntrack entries on remote hosts for a removed port.

1. What is the problem?
Currently the id in resource routing table is integer, the scope of integer is
very limited, so it should be replaced with biginteger.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
Replacing the integer with biginteger will fix this problem. What's more,
API documentation should be updated at the same time.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to realize
the solution?
None.

Originally when I tried to install trove with redstack file, it replied me that dnf was not found on my system.

Considering CentOS doesn't supports dnf while Fedora still supports yum, I think it is approperate to use yum to install packages instead of dnf.

Stole more functions from devstack, and add support for suse.

This ps should reduce the change of gate failure as a result of
not all pods in kube-system coming online in 180s. It does this
by pulling all images in kube-system before starting the

The point of the delete_image_on_error decorator is to
cleanup an image used during snapshot operations, so it
makes little sense to log an exception trace if the image
delete fails because the image no longer exists, which it
might not since _snapshot_instance method will proactively
delete non-active images in certain situations.

So let's just handle the ImageNotFound and ignore it.

During some upgrade testing I was doing locally, I noticed an issue
where `keystone-manage bootstrap` isn't completely idempotent. This
is because `bootstrap` has the ability to recover lost admin accounts
by reseting the admin user's enabled status and updating their
password, regardless of it being different. This creates a revocation
event and causes admin tokens to be invalid after bootstrap is run
for a second time, making it not as idempotent as we'd like.

This commit introduces a test that exposes this behavior.

The v3 test_create_token test was failing when no username was
specified in the accounts.yaml file. It was actually making an
invalid request rather than creating the request using the
username.

The underlying get_token method actually supports making a
request with username or password so looks like it was just a
mistake not passing the username.

Also, added support for unspecified fields in accounts.yaml.
Rather than fail because the server returns a user ID when
none is specified, just validate that a user ID is present
if no user ID is specified.

The VMAX cinder driver locates volumes on the backend by
using the volume's backend 'DeviceID'. It does not check
to ensure the volume retrieved matches the volume in the
cinder database. This can cause inconsistencies in cinder,
where a volume may be deleted off the backend, but remains
in the cinder database. This patch addresses the issue by
ensuring the 'ElementName' of the volume retrieved matches
the VMAX cinder driver element name ('OS-' + cinder UUID).

When switching project, the session token is revoked by
django_openstack_auth as a fix to endlessly growing list of session
tokens per Bug 1227754.

The revocation of the token, however, will cause Heat operations to fail
if Heat still requires the token after user switches projects. This
happens often when launching a stack with token only and user switching
project immediately thereafter.

This change creates a new token for use with heat client. The new token
is reused for the same session as the heatclient object is memorized.
The new token is not tracked or added to session token list thus it does
not defeat the original intention of revoking the session token to fix
Bug 1227754.

This patch ensures that if the local repo server has a copy of the
get-pip.py script then it will be used instead of reaching out to
the default location on the internet.

The tasks to set upper constraints are removed form the unbound
and repo-server playbooks as those roles do not execute any form
of pip installation.

This approach is taken to ensure that:

- Before the repo is built, the get-pip process in the pip_install
  role still has two chances to fetch the get-pip.py script. If we
  simply override the first URL option in group_vars then the
  initial task will fail before the repo is built for the release
  being executed and we would therefore only get one fallback.

- After the repo is built, if the lxc-host-setup and other pre-repo
  playbooks are run, the plays will use the repo's get-pip script
  instead of reaching upstream to fetch a fresh one. This maintains
  a consistent get-pip script version within the same tag forever.
  If group_vars are set for the targets of these plays to use the
  upstream URL then the experience is not the same - the lxc_hosts
  group will always get the latest upstream get-pip script every
  time the playbook executes, resulting in the lxc hosts having a
  different copy of the script to other hosts and containers.
