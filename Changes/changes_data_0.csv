We have many services (Nova, Neutron, Glance etc) implemented the
new RBAC (project scope and project personas). For these services,
all tests should pass as projects personas (project reader) does
not impact existing testing/usage.

keystone has system scope adopted in their policy for now which
we need to make it work for project scope also and until then
we will see test failing.

This commit adds a new tempest full job which enable the scope
and new defaults of RBAC for applicable services.

The default behavior in OVN has been to allow traffic by default
unless explicitly blocked. Neutron default policy is to block all
the traffic for those ports that belong to a Security Group.

To implement this with OVN, we created a Port Group 'neutron_pg_drop'
to which we added all the ports that belonged to a Neutron SG.
At scale, this could pose some issues as we could find the PG
with tens of thousands ports affecting the performance.

With this core OVN patch [0], there is the option to reverse the
behavior and Neutron then would need to do the opposite:

- Create a default 'allow' port group and add those ports that
  do not belong to any SG.

- Set the config setting in OVN to change the policy.

- Remove the old 'drop' Port Group

Ideally, this new Port Group will have a lot less ports and
should perform better.

Please keep in mind that:

- This hasn't been tested
- There's no way to tell from the schema if the core OVN knob is going
  to be honored
- There are cases missing in this current patch (eg. port removed from a
  SG)
- No tests added
- No code accounting for the db sync tool
- Maybe others

This is just a quick PoC.

This is improvement of functional test of
prometheus plugin. By this fix, the created
prometheus rule files are checked by promtool.
If the syntax of them are invalid, the test fails.

This patch adopts the recommendation outlined in  OSSN-0090 [1], in
which two instances of the glance-api service are deployed:
- A ""user facing"" glance-api service, accessible via the Public
  keystone endpoint.
- An ""internal facing only"" service, accessible via the Admin and
  Internal keystone endpoints.

The user facing instance is configured so it does not report any image
location information. This is achieved by configuring glance-api.conf
with the show_image_direct_url and show_multiple_locations set to False.

The internal service operates on a separate TCP port (defaults to 9293)
with its own glance-api.conf that configures show_image_direct_url and
show_multiple_locations set to True.

In order for cinder and nova to have access to the image location data,
both services are configured to access glance via the internal service.

This patch creates special podman socket for sensubility purposes
on /var/lib instead of /run as it is tmpfs and so permission changes
would perish after reboot.

This patch also removes rsyslog configuration for separate HC log file.
This is not needed anymore since sensubility fetches data straight from podman
instead of parsing the log file.

Sensubility is also set to connect to QDR in scenario001-standalone job
so that it is visible in the logs that HC script succeeds.

Primarily remove the workaround added in
Ia6d512ff2ae417bab938cb095fbb0884d195010a which added
continued use of autocommit, which is incompatible with
SQLAlchemy 2.0.

Also set the environment for unit tests to report compatability
warnings, although it appears none are being reported at this time.

Also cuts out the db upgrade cruft to only use the online database
migration code through oslo_db's enginefacade, which has the smarts
to handle online or offline migrations.

And then, retools unit/functional test data storage to utlize sqlite,
and in that re-tooled the queries to prevent locking conditions
which could exist with queries, and some additional refactoring/cleanup.

Also, don't mock and test time.sleep().

Additionally, it looks like we have discovered the root cause of the
memory/connection leakage issue which has been observed, due to the
way lists of nodes are processed/returned.

tripleo-ansible-inventory was deprecated in
Ie02259336c763cfa980b59ad64f9e478d05690fb leaving no method to merge
""multistack"" inventories.

This patch restructures the inventory to allow merging via ansible
e.g by passing multiple inventory files or an inventory dir

The <plan_name> group is now a child of the ""allovercloud"" group (was
vice-versa) allowing the allovercloud group to be merged from multiple
inventory files.

The ""overcloud"" group is no longer a special case and will only exist if
that is the plan name.

generate_tripleo_ansible_inventory now generates a merged inventory to
avoid conflicts in <role_name> group vars.

Introduce new module - interface for db access, which uses new
reader/writer session model. All db API methods are placed under
single point.

In this, we now also make use of enginefacade to simplify our
overall interactions and invocation of the database.

Had to comment out an alter_table operation which was written
around changing an enum declaration. Except that maps to
varchars with a precise length of the maximum enum.
The net effect for alembic was that it was attempting to
copy the table, drop the old table, and then rename the modified
copy. This results in an error such as:

oslo_db.exception.DBReferenceError: (sqlite3.IntegrityError) FOREIGN KEY constraint failed

Since this is outside the supported upgrade window by *years* and
the existing field length is perfectly fine to hold the additional
enums, the migration has been commented out.

Also removes use of ``version_id`` which was previously used
for ORM object deduplication, however this is also reliant upon
in-memory state being authoritative which is problematic in
itself, espescialy when load balancers are involved.

The _update_available_resources periodic makes resource allocation
adjustments while holding the COMPUTE_RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE based on the
list of instances assigned to this host of the resource tracker and
based on the migrations where the source or the target host is the host
of the resource tracker. So if the instance.host or the migration
context changes without holding the COMPUTE_RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE while
the _update_available_resources task is running there there will be data
inconsistency in the resource tracker.

This patch makes sure that during evacuation the instance.host and the
migration context is changed while holding the semaphore.

stable/train specific change: fair locking was introduced from ussuri
forward. See Ia5e521e0f0c7a78b5ace5de9f343e84d872553f9
So the train backport does not add fair=True to the synchronized
decorator of finish_evacuation as that would interfere with the other
functions taking the same lock without fair=True.

While we do rotate the ansible.log file, it's never cleaned. This can
lead to some issues, depending on the amount of day-2 operations
(scaling, update, etc) - increasing size without control is usually a
bad thing.

Notes:
- we're using `find' instead of tmpwatch, because we want to target
  precise file pattern to remove. tmpwatch does the exact contrary.
- we're pushing the `find' in the existing container log cleaning, so
  that we don't have to edit newer releases to remove any new script we
  may want to add
- mistral being removed in newer releases (stable/wallaby), we can
  safely make this ""train-only"", and let newer releases override that
  script so that we don't have dangling things

We had an issue in os-brick that caused a failure in cinder gate.
The wallaby patch for the fix is merged[1] but wallaby has
transitioned into EM and we can't release os-brick wallaby anymore.

To fix the cinder gate situation (as seen here[2]), this patch adds
os-brick as a required project for the ceph job (which is failing)
so we will fetch os-brick from source and not the released version
hence fixing the gate situation.

While the reverse order may work, it's considered invalid by OVN and not
guaranteed to work properly since OVN may not necessarily know which of
two ports is the one to configure.

This configuration also triggered a bug in OVN where tearing down a port
after deploying a new one resulted in removing flows that serve the
port.

There is a patch up for review for OVN [1] to better handle multiple
assignment of the same port, but it doesn't make the setup any more
valid.

The existing generic restart_compute_service() call in the nova test
base class is not appropriate for the libvirt functional test that needs
to reconfigure the libvirt connection as it is not aware of the libvirt
specific mocking needed when a compute service is started.

So this patch adds a specific restart_compute_service() call
to nova.tests.functional.libvirt.base.ServersTestBase. This will be used
by a later patch testing [pci]device_spec reconfiguration scenarios.

This change showed that some of the existing libvirt functional test
used the incomplete restart_compute_service from the base class. Others
used local mocking to inject new pci config to the restart. I moved all
these to the new function and removed the local mocking.

As it's mentioned in uWSGI docs[1]:
""In order to use https option be sure that you have OpenSSL development
headers installed (e.g. libssl-dev on Debian). Install them and rebuild
uWSGI so the build system will automatically detect it.""

This change ensures that required package is installed on the host where
uWSGI is being built.

We don't need to force reinstall during an openstack upgrade because
uWSGI version was bumped in Zed[2] so uWSGI is going to be
reinstalled/upgraded anyway.

According to my tests, OpenSSL development headers are not required for
distro installs.

Today Nova updates the mac_address of a direct-physical port to reflect
the MAC address of the physical device the port is bound to. But this
can only be done before the port is bound. However during migration Nova
does not update the MAC when the port is bound to a different physical
device on the destination host.

This patch extends the libvirt virt driver to provide the MAC address of
the PF in the pci_info returned to the resource tracker. This
information will be then persisted in the extra_info field of the
PciDevice object.

Then the port update logic during migration, resize, live
migration, evacuation and unshelve is also extended to record the MAC of
physical device in the port binding profile according to the device on
the destination host.

The related neutron change Ib0638f5db69cb92daf6932890cb89e83cf84f295
uses this info from the binding profile to update the mac_address field
of the port when the binding is activated.

While the reverse order may work, it's considered invalid by OVN and not
guaranteed to work properly since OVN may not necessarily know which of
two ports is the one to configure.

This configuration also triggered a bug in OVN where tearing down a port
after deploying a new one resulted in removing flows that serve the
port.

There is a patch up for review for OVN [1] to better handle multiple
assignment of the same port, but it doesn't make the setup any more
valid.

I thought we fixed all the double mocking issues with
I3998d0d49583806ac1c3ae64f1b1fe343cefd20d but I was wrong.

While we used both mock and unittest.mock the fixtures.MockPatch
used the mock lib instead of the unittest.mock lib.
The path Ibf4f36136f2c65adad64f75d665c00cf2de4b400 (Remove the PowerVM driver)
removed the last user of mock lib from nova. So it is also
removed the mock from test-requirements. This triggered that
fixtures.MockPatch athat started using unittest.mock too.

Before Ibf4f36136f2c65adad64f75d665c00cf2de4b400 a function can be mocked
twice once with unittest.mock and once with fixtures.MockPatch (still
using mock). However after that patch both path of such double
mocking goes through unittest.mock and the second one fails.

So this patch fixes double mocking so far hidden behind
fixtures.MockPatch.

This patch made the py310 and functional-py310 jobs voting  on master
however that has been dropped as part of the backport.

tripleo-ansible-inventory was deprecated in
Ie02259336c763cfa980b59ad64f9e478d05690fb leaving no method to merge
""multistack"" inventories.

This patch restructures the inventory to allow merging via ansible
e.g by passing multiple inventory files or an inventory dir

The <plan_name> group is now a child of the ""allovercloud"" group (was
vice-versa) allowing the allovercloud group to be merged from multiple
inventory files.

The ""overcloud"" group is no longer a special case and will only exist if
that is the plan name.

generate_tripleo_ansible_inventory now generates a merged inventory to
avoid conflicts in <role_name> group vars.

os-vif currently set the requested mtu as part of separate request
to the port add command. As a result the port is initially created
with mbufer pool for the jumboframe size, which results in an
error in openvswitch-vswitch logs.

This change moves the mtu update request into ovsdb transaction.

looking them up (using /clusters/<id>). Most notably, the cluster's
API address is absent from the former method, and is only available
for the latter.

Arguably, someone spinning up a cluster from the SDK might be
interested in subsequently interacting with it using the Kubernetes
API, so that information might be relevant.

Thus, add a get_coe_cluster_by_id() method, so that Connection objects
configured with use_direct_get=True can look up a cluster by ID, and
get the richer data set.

In addition, since the same considerations apply to cluster template
lookup, add a get_cluster_template_by_id() method as well.

In py310 unittest.mock does not allow to mock the same function twice as
the second mocking will fail to autospec the Mock object created by the
first mocking.

This patch manually fixes the double mocking.

Fixed cases:
1) one of the mock was totally unnecessary so it was removed
2) the second mock specialized the behavior of the first generic mock.
   In this case the second mock is replaced with the configuration of
   the first mock
3) a test case with two test steps mocked the same function for each
   step with overlapping mocks. Here the overlap was removed to have
   the two mock exists independently

The get_connection injection in the libvirt functional test needed a
further tweak (yeah I know it has many already) to act like a single
mock (basically case #2) instead of a temporary re-mocking. Still the
globalness of the get_connection mocking warrant the special set / reset
logic there.

Libvirt 7.7 changed the mdev device naming to include the parent PCI
device when listing node devices. The domain, however, will still only
see the UUID and not see the parent PCI device. Changing the parsing to
simply drop the PCI identifier is not enough as the device cannot be
found when attempting to lookup the new ID.

Modify the Libvirt Driver's _get_mediated_device_information to tolerate
different formats of the mdev name. This first uses the legacy behavior
by trying to lookup the device name that is passed in (typically
mdev_<uuid> format) and if that is not found, iterates the list of mdev
node devices until the right UUID is found and selects that one.

Note that the lookup of the mdev device by UUID are needed in order
to keep the ability to recreate assigned mediated devices on a reboot of
the compute node.

Additionally, the libvirt utils parsing method mdev_name2uuid, has
been updated to tolerate both mdev_<uuid> and mdev_<uuid>_<pciid>
formats.

Today Nova updates the mac_address of a direct-physical port to reflect
the MAC address of the physical device the port is bound to. But this
can only be done before the port is bound. However during migration Nova
does not update the MAC when the port is bound to a different physical
device on the destination host.

This patch extends the libvirt virt driver to provide the MAC address of
the PF in the pci_info returned to the resource tracker. This
information will be then persisted in the extra_info field of the
PciDevice object.

Then the port update logic during migration, resize, live
migration, evacuation and unshelve is also extended to record the MAC of
physical device in the port binding profile according to the device on
the destination host.

The related neutron change Ib0638f5db69cb92daf6932890cb89e83cf84f295
uses this info from the binding profile to update the mac_address field
of the port when the binding is activated.

In this patch, I added an operations of image metadata object.

By default ADMIN user in the new Secure RBAC policies should behave in
the same way as in the legacy rules so basically every API operation for
any project should be allowed for ADMIN user.
In the new rules there are roles like PROJECT_MEMBER and PROJECT_READER
and those personas don't inherits directly from ADMIN which means that
if something is possible to e.g. PROJECT_MEMBER it isn't automatically
also allowed to ADMIN and we need to explicitly allow ADMIN user to do
such requests. It was done like that for many of API calls already but
not for all of them (probably by mistake).

This patch introduces new composite check ADMIN_OR_PROJECT_MEMBER and
uses it in the check strings where ADMIN or PROJECT_MEMBER user is
allowed to use the API.
It also changes some of the check strings which used ""policy_or"" to
combine ADMIN and PROJECT_MEMBER or PROJECT_READER so that those
composite checks ADMIN_OR_PROJECT_MEMBER and ADMIN_OR_PROJECT_READER are
used everywhere.

It is important to bear in mind the Redfish Interoperability Validator and profiles we are developing are not a panacea. Operators will need the support of the ironic community and vendors to determine the severity of identified issues, and, ultimately interoperability.\n\nThat tool and a couple of more fundamental tools, Redfish Protocol Validator and Redfish Service Validator, provide a relatively quick means of testing a Redfish service's maturity, compliance with the standard, and interoperability with ironic. However, analysis of the test results will require time and effort.\n\nIn addition to those tools, we should expect testing of hardware with ironic and the driver will be required to determine sufficient interoperability.\n\nDetermining and improving interoperability are hard work :)\n2. The profiles we are implementing have been factored on a hardware interface implementation basis. An operator can choose to test only interfaces of interest. BIOS, boot, and inspect are optional, so they can be excluded if there is no interest in them.\n3. The Redfish Interoperability Profile standard offers support for including comments in a profile. We could add more which identify the relationships between requirements and ironic features. However, I do not believe they could identify all of them and be easily understood.\n4. Finally, this is our first attempt to work on improving interoperability. I highly recommend we do the best we can now and agree to improve its ease of use with follow-on changes.\n\nI look forward to your thoughts on this.""}, {'account_id': 31021, 'date': '2020-12-02 09:38:24.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 7.'}, {'account_id': 11292, 'date': '2020-12-02 13:02:49.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 7:\n\nRichard, I agree with your comments. As far as the scope of this change is concerned, I think the profiles are good as they are. The only thing may be the README, where I am still not sure if it makes sense to copy instructions from the upstream repo (rather than having only a reference and complimentary information).\n\nFor a discussion *beyond this change*:\nThe point on usability remains an issue. I showed the current state of the profiles to our procurement colleagues. I don't know if you remember the first time you saw the validator's output ... ;)\nIMO in order to have the profiles being used, their usability needs to increase.

As of now to leverage caching, oslo_cache library has to be imported
and configured everytime it's needed.

This change migrates such implementatio to use `cache_utils.py`
which returns a cache client to perform caching operations. This
eliminates the purpose of importing oslo_cache everytime when needed.

To get a cache client:
```
from ceilometer import cache_utils
.
cache_client = cache_utils.get_client(conf)

Recent changes to the httpd config template[0] have led to
failure of the image-serve validation during the ""Ensure registry does answer""
task as the '*' host was not reachable.

Substitution of the 'localhost' for '*' should resolve the issue.

Same modification was applied to the ""Ensure port is open"" task
for the sake of consistency.

os-vif currently set the requested mtu as part of separate request

with mbufer pool for the jumboframe size, which results in an

This change moves the mtu update request into ovsdb transaction.

This reverts commit 89ecaeb1152b22f41b74c9e594acfb4dddb056eb.

Reason for revert:
The ironic_pxe_tftp service has never been deployed. The correct
service name is tripleo_ironic_pxe_tftp.service. Because the original
change does not explain why the service should be stopped, this change
reverts the useless change instead of fixing it.

If there is a failed resize that also failed the cleanup
process performed by _cleanup_remote_migration() the retry
of the resize will fail because it cannot rename the current
instances directory to _resize.

This renames the _cleanup_failed_migration() that does the
same logic we want to _cleanup_failed_instance_base() and
uses it for both migration and resize cleanup of directory.

It then simply calls _cleanup_failed_instances_base() with
the resize dir path before trying a resize.

While querying placement to discover hosts to execute virtual
machines (VMs) migration (or resize, which is a cold VM migration),
Nova is not sending the current availability zone (AZ) of the VM.
Therefore, there are situations where nova decides to migrate the VM
to a host in a different AZ, which causes problems if the setup is
using `cross_az_attach=False`.

Other things such as server groups, affinity and antiaffinity rules
are honored in migrate and resize. Therefore, it makes sense to take
the situation with the ""cross_az_attach"" option as well.

By querying Placement with the current AZ of the VM, we (Nova) will
receive only hosts in the given AZ, which in turn resolves the
mentioned issue of cross zone migration during VMs resize or host
migration.

Initially, _check_incomplete_consumers was intended to find the case
when consumers are mentioned in allocation but do not exist in the
consumer table. Due to a bug it's possible to have rows in the
consumer table those are not in the allocation table. The second case
it seems was not expected and it can be tricky to automate a cleanup
with zero touch upgrade.

This patch modifies the check such way it counts only consumers
presented in the allocation table.

We parse the output of commands to get information around the
OpenVswitch versions. At least one of those commands supports
localization[1]. In order to ensure that the parsing won't fail on
unexpected character, we have to make sure all commands run with an
known locale.

We add a wrapper around the module.run_ansible ansible ansible command
that ensures that all commands run with C.UTF-8 locale.

We need to support string and list for that wrapper for command

Currently, yaml-validate.py cannot detect trailing slashes under
""list_concat"" and ""if"".

  volumes:
    - /example:/example/ # <======= detected

  volumes:
    list_concat:
    - - /example1:/example1/ # <===== not detected
      - /example2:/example2
    - if:
      - {get_param: TestValue}
      - - /example3:/example3/ # <==== not detected
        - /example4:/example4

This fix makes yaml-validate.py detect the these trailing slashes.

Because the current implementation digs ""list"" twice in one call to
check_volumes(), trailing slashes under ""list_concat"" are not detected.
Because the current implementation ignores ""if"", trailing slashes under
""if"" are not deleted. check_volumes() doesn't have to ignore ""if""
because non-volume-style value is ignored because of IndexError.

From now on, tripleo_nftables will use a directory containing rules
snippets instead of a parameter.

This will allow to push snippets from other roles during the deploy,
and then configure the firewall.

We therefore add two new modules:
- tripleo_nftables_snippet: creates files with the relevant content,
as YAML
- tripleo_nftables_from_files: gather snippets, merge the contents,
sorts the rules and pass the whole list to its output.

The tripleo_firewall role is now creating a snippet based on the
current parameter, so that we're still 100% compatible with
tripleo-heat-templates way of pushing things in.

This new usage is especially interesting for the standalone
roles/playbooks deploy, since each service role will just need to:
- ensure the destination directory exists
- push its rule snippet in there, in the tripleo_nftables format, in
  YAML
- call the ""configure.yaml"" from tripleo_nftables in order to get the
  rules added/processed (and, eventually, the playbook will call the

The playbook cli-overcloud-node-kernelargs.yaml calls the tuned role
and then the tripleo_kernel role.

The tuned role executes the following command:
    tuned-adm profile throughput-performance

This has the side-effect of adding $tuned_params to the options line
of /boot/loader/entries files, which is required to add its kernel
arguments from /boot/grub2/grubenv.

However when grub2-mkconfig is called, $tuned_params is *removed* from
the /boot/loader/entries files, breaking the enablement of the tuned
profile.

This change runs tuned-adm after grub2-mkconfig, which adds back
$tuned_params if there is an active profile.

Also the job does not use the proposed change in heat but the current

Octavia API allows to create fully populated load balancers with
a single call, and the pools included in that call could include
HM. OVN-octavia-provider was not implementing this option and only
the loadbalancer/listener(s)/pool(s)/member(s) were created,
keeping the HM at the Octavia API as PENDING_CREATE.

This also generated leftovers when trying to delete the loadbalancer
with the --cascade option.

When a volume is created in NetApp ONTAP, it has a few autosize
attributes that are set by default. The values of the attributes
are defined according to the volume type (DP/RW).

During the replica promotion, the types are swaped between source
and destination volumes, but the autosize values were not being
updated. This patch fixes this behavior, calling an autosize reset
after promoting the replica.

As of now, when attempting to rescue a volume-based instance
using an image without the hw_rescue_device and/or hw_rescue_bus
properties set, the rescue api call fails (as non-stable rescue
for volume-based instances are not supported) leaving the instance
in error state.

This change checks for hw_rescue_device/hw_rescue_bus image
properties before attempting to rescue and if the property
is not set, then fail with proper error message, without changing
instance state.

Ussuri and Victoria branches are in Extended Maintenance[1].
Once any stable branch is moved to EM state then, Tempest and
its plugins needs to be released[2] so that we have the compatible
tags to test the EM stable branches[3].

We taged ussuri-last & victoria-last for tempest[4] but forgot to do
it for the tempest plugins. Using the tag 2.4.0 hash which is compatible
for tempest ussuri-last and victoria-last.

Prior to this change, trunk bridges are created by os-vif but deleted
by Neutron when the last vif is removed from it. This creates race
conditions in some use cases, like DPDK with vhostuserclient mode, when
VMs are rebooted. To avoid these races, Neutron will not delete trunk
bridges anymore. Their creation and deletion will be os-vif's
responsiblity.

This patch check the presence of the output callback *vf_validation_json*
which is mandatory for a correct behavior of the VF.
Without this checks the VF will execute the ansible command,
but wont be able to find the json log associated to the run,
and will failed at the end.
This check prevent useless investigations and save time for the user.

It also check the presence of the roles path (if one of all the paths is correct)
to prevent as well strange behavior from Ansible and the framework.

This is the first WIP version. It uses a very simple block for timeout
if expected rows < found rows. The check will need to be smarter. But
starting simple to play around with the plumbing.

We might want to start with a still simple but slightly smarter
cleaved_rows - ""some fuzzy number"". Maybe a percentage, or somehow use
the current tombstone rows.

Still not 100% happy but wanted to get something up as a start. And then
will continue to tune it.

Added a few things to the CleaveContext:
  - last_rows_cleaved (which is always updated after a cleave)
  - blocked (bool)
  - blocked_timestamp (time it was blocked used for timeout)
  - blocked_name (shardrange name)

The blocked_name is if the existing ranges_done and ranges_todo isn't good
enough, I'e what if something happens under the hood during long
cleaving and the ""next"" shardrange isn't the one we blocked on, we can
unblock and attempt to continue cleaving. Not fully convinced. But need
to play with this, write tests to convince myself.

Once a shard container has been created as part of the sharder cycle it
pulls the shards own_shard_range, updates the object_count and
bytes_used and pushes this to the root container. The root container
can use these to display the current container stats.

However, it is not until a shard gets to the CLEAVED state, that it holds
enough information for it's namespace, so before this the number it returns
is incorrect.
Further, when we find and create a shard, it starts out with the number
of objects, at the time, that are expected to go into them. This is
better answer then, say, nothing.

So it's better for the shard to send it's current own_shard_range but
don't update the stats until it can be authoritive of that answer.
This patch adds a new SHARD_UPDATE_STAT_STATES that track what
ShardRange states a shard needs to be in in order to be responsible,
current definition is:

    SHARD_UPDATE_STAT_STATES = [ShardRange.CLEAVED, ShardRange.ACTIVE,
                                ShardRange.SHARDING, ShardRange.SHARDED,
                                ShardRange.SHRINKING, ShardRange.SHRUNK]

This also has the advantage of a cleaving shard to have an idea of the
number of objects expected to be cleaved into it, at least from the
leader who split the namespace is concerned.

This could be used to allow a small replica to know if it has an
undersized portion of the required namespace and so wait until the other
replicas to cleave before moving on.

This middleware is used to enable request tracing. At this stage the is
no actual HMAC To start tracing so any value can be put into the
query_string parameter trace_sig. When you do that req will be traced.

The middleware also introduces another option which will trace every x
request. This can be handy if you want to insert the middleware into
something like the internal client config.

The request will start and stop tracing as the request hits this
middleware. As such, to get as much info as possible it's best to have it
as close to the front of the pipeline as possible.

The proxy has been instrumented so when making calls to storage nodes,
so long as the middleware is also inserted into the storage node
pipelines, the tracing context is injected into the sub requests allowing
us to trace a single request throughout the cluster.

Request tracing utilises the OpenTelemetry framework, which has now
become a swift dependency. We could pull this out and warn.

Because a trace is scoped by the request. There is a trace_data object that
is used to store some tracing metadata. Namely:

 - The call stack (so we can name middleware uniquely)
 - The current tracer object. As it's this object that creates spans.

Tracing and eventlet has issues. So we also make the GreenAsyncPool
trace aware, and also created sub-classed GreenPile to
TraceAwareGreenPile, so it can pass a span (if it exists) into the
eventlet environment, allowing them to be traced correctly.

We already expose functions to handle the instantiation
of classes such as RPCServer and RPCTransport but the
same was never done for RPCClient so the API is
inconsistent in its enforcement.

This adds a get_rpc_client function that should be used
instead of instatiating the RPCClient class directly to
be more consistent.

This also allows to handle more logic inside the function
in the future such as if implementations for an async client
is implemented, as investigation in [1] has shown.

Left the pinning for stable/wallaby as we probably don't want to bump

Reason for revert:
The issue caused by the new version has been fixed or workarounded.

When Nova NFS backend is enabled, all instance data is stored in
the NFS storage, and the storage access should be ready when
the nova-compute service is started.

That's the one which fixes possible wrong permissions in /var/lib/nova/
issues by enforcing that ordering by additional systemd service
dependency.

Note: nova_statedir_owner is a one-off init container executed in
step_3, while NFS mounts are created earlier by the host prep tasks.
Here everything is set properly and needs no explicit dependencies.

Currently snapshot delete requires access to the source volume and
the operation fails if the source volume doesn't exist in the backend.
This prevents some snapshots from being deleted when the source volume
image is deleted from the backend for some reason (for example, after
cluster format).

This change makes the rbd driver to skip updating the source volume
if it doesn't exist. A warning log is left so that operators can be
aware of any skip event.

This commit also includes a squash to add a releasenote from
I40f6eb1f104da4410d32410940824a88f7d1ec62 to reduce backporting
workload.

applied a `s!^//*!/!` to client-provided paths before handing things off

Swift, however, actually cares about what clients requested; this change
is particularly glaring the case when using domain_remap. Then, a request
for

should be translated to

which is very much distinct from

This patch reverts the breaking change that CPython introduced. This fixes
the some func test failures we've seen on py39.

If the charm class defines haproxy healthcheck endpoints for api
exposing services render them into the haproxy template.

An example declaration would be as follows

   class MyCharm(HAOpenStackCharm):
      ...
      healthcheck = {
         ""option"": ""httpchk GET /healthcheck"",
         ""http-check"": ""expect status 200""

Currently when using SNMPv3, iRMC driver does not use SNMPv3
authentication parameters so the SNMPv3 authentication will
always fail. And iRMC cannot recognize FIPS mode, so when FIPS mode
is enabled, iRMC driver could still use non-FIPS-compliant algorithms.

This commit changes iRMC driver to require and use SNMPv3
authentication parameters when 'irmc_snmp_version' is set to v3 and
also makes iRMC driver to force 'irmc_snmp_version' to v3,
'irmc_snmp_auth_proto' to SHA and 'irmc_snmp_priv_proto' to AES
when FIPS mode is enabled, because currently among the algorithms
supported by iRMC, only SHA and AES are FIPS compliant.

Currently when using SNMPv3, iRMC driver does not use SNMPv3
authentication parameters so the SNMPv3 authentication will
always fail. And iRMC cannot recognize FIPS mode, so when FIPS mode
is enabled, iRMC driver could still use non-FIPS-compliant algorithms.

This commit changes iRMC driver to require and use SNMPv3
authentication parameters when 'irmc_snmp_version' is set to v3 and
also makes iRMC driver to force 'irmc_snmp_version' to v3,
'irmc_snmp_auth_proto' to SHA and 'irmc_snmp_priv_proto' to AES
when FIPS mode is enabled, because currently among the algorithms
supported by iRMC, only SHA and AES are FIPS compliant.

It is now possible to do a PXE network boot with grub as an
alternative to iPXE. Grub is loaded via the signed shim, so it may
allow end-to-end automated deployments with secure-boot enabled.

To use grub network boot, deploy bifrost with variable
``default_boot_interface`` set to ``pxe``.

This feature is tested by job
bifrost-integration-redfish-uefi-fedora-latest.

test-bifrost.sh is also modified to only enable the hardware-type
driver which matches driver used for test nodes. This allows a default
interface to be set which is not supported by one of the enabled
drivers (for example, ironic will exit because the ilo driver doesn't
support the pxe boot interface)

When creating a backup and it fails we will try
to update the status on the volume but if it does
not exist we will instead fail on that and the
backup will be stuck in creating status which means
cloud admin need to help resetting the status.

This catches the VolumeNotFound exception and ignores
updating the volume status and thus backup will be
set to error and can be deleted by user instead.

After a baremetal instance is deleted, and its allocation is removed
in placement, the ironic node might start cleaning. Eventually nova
will notice and update the inventory to be reserved.
During this window, a new instance may have already picked this
ironic node.

When that race happens today the build fails with an error:
""Failed to reserve node ...""

This change tries to ensure the remaining alternative hosts are
attempted before aborting the build.
Clearly the race is still there, but this makes it less painful.

Add new parameters `pure_trisync_enabled` and
`pure_trisync_pg_name`.

When these parameters are used in conjunction with a
volume type where `type <in> trisync` will create a volume
that is simultaneously replicate to two target arrays, one
synchronously and the other asynchronously.

It is required that two `replication_devices` are provided, one
that is sync and one that is async.

Also adds the ability to retype a volume between `sync` and
`trisync` replication types.

Consistency Groups are also supported for ``trisync`` volume
types, as well as cloning ``trisync`` CGs.

done to be available for admin users and for PROJECT_READER. This didn't
really had the same result as router:external attribute wasn't visible

If there is a failed resize that also failed the cleanup
process performed by _cleanup_remote_migration() the retry
of the resize will fail because it cannot rename the current
instances directory to _resize.

This renames the _cleanup_failed_migration() that does the
same logic we want to _cleanup_failed_instance_base() and
uses it for both migration and resize cleanup of directory.

It then simply calls _cleanup_failed_instances_base() with
the resize dir path before trying a resize.

While the reverse order may work, it's considered invalid by OVN and not
guaranteed to work properly since OVN may not necessarily know which of
two ports is the one to configure.

This configuration also triggered a bug in OVN where tearing down a port
after deploying a new one resulted in removing flows that serve the
port.

There is a patch up for review for OVN [1] to better handle multiple
assignment of the same port, but it doesn't make the setup any more
valid.
