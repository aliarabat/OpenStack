As a work-around to deal with bug 1075838, we modified
monkey_patch in the Cinder binaries.  The root cause of the
issue is/was actually a bug in eventlet but this was a quick
work-around.

Since the change Change-Id: I69ba75136e32e95c6fdf108f0c4fe21a5e3bdbe6
to do this landed, the problem has also been addressed in Keystone.

So, let's revert this patch to get back the greenthread performance
that we may have lost with this change.  For now, everything should
be addressed as long as we don't implement multi api worker in Cinder,
if we do and the evenlet fix hasn't been released we'll need to turn
the modification back on for bin/cinder-api.

Change the type of flavor_id hidden field in EditFlavor form
from IntegerField to CharField since flavor id is a string
representation of UUID now. Additionally change the type of
similar hidden fields in CreateExtraSpec and EditExtraSpec forms.

Remove flavor id generation from form handling code. Id generation
should be done only in corresponding OpenStack components (nova, etc.).
Since nova supports flavor id autogeneration and 'flavorid' parameter
of FlavorManager.create() in novaclient is optional, remove 'flavorid'
parameter from api.nova.flavor_create().

Change flavor ids in test data from strings containing integers
to UUID-like strings to make them correspond to real data.

Update flavor tests to make them compatible with new
api.nova.flavor_create() signature.

Remove conversions of flavor id to int from all tests. In particular,
update test_index_flavor_get_exception() to make it generate unique
UUID flavor ids instead of integers.

Fixes bug 1081808

The start_guests_on_host_boot config option ignores any/all
user-requested VM state and attempts to start every VM assigned to the
hypervisor in question. This means even a VM which was suspended,
paused, in error state, etc will run through the process of attempting
to start. resume_guests_state_on_host_boot provides similar
functionality, except that it confirms the VM was previously in a
running state prior to attempting to restart on compute startup.

This patch will remove the config option entirely.

Some of our documentation dependencies were not listed in
test-requires, so the venv environment in tox needs to be
updated to include them.

Then the build_sphinx command looks for configuration settings
in setup.cfg, so those need to be added.

When Sphinx runs in this way, it ends up creating
RST files for every module it finds in the source tree
so it can document the internal APIs. Those generated files
can be ignored by git.

This patch ensures that jsonutils.to_primitive() is used on the updates
being sent to conductor's instance_update method.  This is primarily so
that we convert datetimes to a string using a very specific format
defined in the timeutils module.  Then, in the conductor manager,
convert these fields back into datetime objects using timeutils.

The conversion to a string was already happening implicitly if you were
using the kombu rpc driver.  The reason is that kombu uses anyjson,
which we hook in to and will automatically use our own to_primitive()
to fix serialization problems for kombu.  Doing it explicitly is better,
and is required for the other rpc drivers to work.

This is to address a problem with sqlite where it would raise an
exception when we try to do an update to a datetime field with a string.

When converting an Aggregate sqlalchemy model to primitive types using
jsonutils.to_primitive(), the hosts and metadata were being left out.
This is because they are implemented as properties on the model and must
be explicitly listed as extra keys to be read.

We also want to make sure that the _hosts and _metadata are eager
loaded.  This patch ensures this gets done by adding it to the
_get_aggregate_query() helper, and making sure it is used everywhere
that is appropriate.  Also, on creation of the aggregate, just manually
set _hosts and _metadata to empty lists, since we know they're empty at
this point.

These changes caused a side effect to the os-aggreages API extension.
The result from creating an aggregate started including 'hosts' and
'metadata'.  There's a hack in there to maintain the same API result.
These don't add any value to this API call anyway, since we know they're
blank at this point.

This adds a new flag: share_dhcp_address which if enabled in
multihost mode will allow all compute nodes to share an ip on
guest network. The code will isolate the address using iptables
and ebtables so it is only visible to the vms.

This patch has two benefits:

a) we don't have to use an ip address from every network for each
compute node. This is especially valuable in vlan mode where the
networks are generally small

b) we can improve security by blocking all access to the ip on the
guest network from outside the compute node. While we could do similar
blocking using a different ip for each node, it makes dhcp setup
much more complicated if a vm is migrated to another node.

Implements blueprint shared-dhcp-ip

This is just a proof of concept prototype for how you could add a
baremetal specific rpc API to the nova-compute service.  This came up as
it there was some desire to have some baremetal specific rpc methods.
This approach has some nice properties.  It allows a baremetal specific
API that is completely independent from the compute rpc API (versioning,
implementation, the queues it uses), but without having to create a new
service for it.

before any others (for example the l3-agent one). This makes DHCP work

nova-dhcpbridge can read in an alternate config file location but wasn't
using it to parse config options.  This fixes a regression introduced in
00786bc554a2dfacb3c6f02fbb7e9c98f35d4262.

This change is motivated by the fact that nova-dhcpbridge is passed to
dnsmasq in restart_dhcp() in nova/network/linux_net.py, and there is
currently no support for overriding config options for nova-dhcpbridge
in that call.  There is support for overriding the FLAGFILE env variable
in that call, but nova-dhcpbridge was ignoring that.  If I start
nova-network with an alternate config this provides a way for me to pass
that config to nova-dhcpbridge as well.

During Ubuntu builds we run the run_test.sh script
during the package build process, so that we can catch
regressions in our packaging before uploading to the archive.

However a recent change writes the output of the nosetests
to an error log so we don't see why the package fail to build.

This patch also displays the output of the nosetests so we
can see why the tests fail without having to look at the nosetests.log.

This patch add the '-v', for a verbose display of nosetests.

Updates the rxtx_factor validations in the instance_types modules so
that rxtx_factor is validated as a float. Given that rxtx_factor is stored
as a float in the database this makes sense... and also adheres
to some of the extension documentation as well (although some of
the extension docs were incorrect as well).

Previously rxtx_factor was being cast into an int which caused it to
be stored and displayed incorrectly via the API.

This patchset adds a test which fails with the old code.

Additionally some of the API docs are corrected so that rxtx_factor is
listed as a float in all examples.

Fixes LP Bug #1081287.

Along with moving to pep8 1.3.3, we also want to standardize
on what we ignore. This patch get's us most of the way there
by setting the ignore list to:
N4,E125, E126, E711,E712.

Almost all changes made here are white-space/indentation changes.

The removal of Hacking N4 errors from the ignore list will
be handled in a seperate patch.

The Nova Glance wrapper returns all images metadata
if the parameter 'limit' is not define. It doesn't
split the image metadata list.

So the sub method fetch_image is no more needed.
We can delete it.

I added a check in Nova Glance wrapper to be sure
the parameter 'marker' or another one aren't set
to 'None' (like in bug #1065053).

with sequence numbers, also, messing up the re-building of the chain on
the destination.

Fixes bug 1064083

Change ID I3e2973 also didn't change the stub of VM.snapshot to
VDI.snapshot, but tests still passed due to the new code ignoring all
exceptions while snapshotting.  Potential issues in
snapshot_attached_here() would also be ignored due to excessive stubbing
in the xenapi migration testing.  This is also addressed here.

This patch adds a migration_update method to the conductor API.  This is
used by the compute manager to push off db access to nova-conductor.
The only field that compute was updating was the status, so that is the
only field allowed by the API.

Instead of just sending the miration_id to the conductor, we are sending
all of the migration data.  This is done in the spirit of
'no-db-messaging'.  While no other data is needed right now, it's easier
to send it all now than have to change the API later.

During quota check we used to simply retrieve the entire collection
of resources from the database, then counting them in Python. This
patch introduces a specialized _get_collection_count() method, which
instead take advantage of the DB's built-in count capabilities.

In order to take advantage of this, plugins can now implement
get_*_count() methods for their resources. This is used (if present)
by the quota checking function.

Patch incorporates review feedback from Dan W, Alex Xu, Zhongyue Luo,
Edgar Magana, Akihiro Motoki and gongysh.

This adds loadables.py which contains code that is to be shared by
scheduling filtering and weighing in Nova and Cinder.  This is
cherry-picked from Nova (Change I1b217dc2bc2d1dc2235c8251318d06b46597e8f4)

Original commit message:

"" ...
Most of this code originated from nova/scheduler/filters/__init__.py
(which was copied from nova/api extension loading).

This makes it more generic so that it can be shared. Note that this
functionality is quite different than the generic plugin manager that
exists in openstack-common. That code could not be used here without
some significant changes. It also seems pretty overkill for the
functionality required by scheduling filtering and weighing.""

When you attach a volume to a running instance, only the running
xml is updated in libvirt. This is due to the usage of the
VIRT_DOMAIN_AFFECT_CURRENT flag passed to attach device. What we
really want is to affect both the config and the running xml. There
is no combination of flags that works in all states, so we explicitly
set the right combination of flags depending on the running state
of the vm.

Includes a test to test_virt_drivers to ensure the flags are passed
correctly.

It doesn't seem that Xen will set the 'root_device_name' property on
instances.  This is causing instance_block_mapping to return early
without evaluating the bdm before returning the list of device_names
in use.  I'm not sure why instance_block_mapping does this
(optimization?) but on Xen at least it seems that it should not.

Added a check for Xen compute_driver flag in instance_block_mapping to
""guess"" the root_device_name (similarlly to what is done in
compute.utils for swap and ephemeral).

Set the 'host' field on the instance after the resource tracker

The field is set after resources are confirmed to be available while the

resources usage values will be consistent even if the

Set host prior to allocating network information.

Make sure 'host' field on the instance is set before allocating

Summary:
* provide a pluggable ServiceGroup monitoring API
* refactor the old DB-based implementation to the new API

Currently nova compute nodes periodically write to the database (every
10 seconds by default) to report their liveness.  This implementation
factors out this functionality and make it a set of abstract internal
APIs with a pluggable backend implementation.  Currently it's named as
ServiceGroup APIs.

With this effort, we are hopeful to see the following benefits:

 * We expect to see more backend implementations in addition to the
default database-based one, such as ZooKeeper (as described in
blueprint zk-service-heartbeat) or rabbitmq heartbeat based.

 * We expect the code to live in openstack-common so projects other
than Nova can take advantage of the internal APIs.

 * Lay the foundations to use lower overhead heartbeat mechanisms
which scale better.

 * Other than reporting whether a node in a service group is up or
down, the code may also be used to query for members.  Other parts of
the code could also take advantage of the new APIs. One noteable
example is the MatchMaker in the rpc library, which may even become
redundant. We have been working with Eric at Cloudscaling to see how
this fits with the matchmaker. It is likely that this code will need
to be used, at least by the peer-to-peer based RPC mechanisms, to
implement the new create_worker method.

Updates dns_driver.DNSDriver so that we raise NotImplementedError
instead of returning empty result sets or passing. Since this
class is the default dns_driver for Nova it can be quite
confusing when it returns empty results (which actually
causes some HTTP 500 errors as well).

Also updates several test suites to use MiniDNS instead
(which is meant for testing) including some additional
cleanup to remove the dnstest.txt file.

Ported code originally from Dan Prince
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/11815/

Fix slight style issue. Add a log.warn in addition to
throwing an exception in minidns. Add an ignore of the
said exception in manager.

This adds the use of eventlet's db_pool module so that we can make mysql
calls without blocking the whole process.

New config options are introduced:

sql_dbpool_enable -- Enables the use of eventlet's db_pool
sql_min_pool_size -- Set the minimum number of SQL connections

The default for sql_dbpool_enable is False for now, so there is
no forced behavior changes for those using mysql.  sql_min_pool_size
is defaulted to 1 to match behavior if not using db_pool.

Adds a new test module for our sqlalchemy code, testing this new option
as much as is possible without requiring mysql server to be running.

Nova endpoint in keystone was registered if n-cpu is enabled. However it is
a usual case where n-cpu runs on a different host in multi-node setup and
it results in no endpoint for nova. n-api is a better condition since nova-api
and keystone usually run on a same host.

Currently when list servers from all tenants (i.e. --all-tenants is set as 1
when ""nova list""), privilege is required.

However, computer pollster in ceilometer need to get all instances from
all tenants in one host. Granting admin privilege to the pollster is
not very secure.

All tenants servers list should be policy-based, instead of requiring
admin privelege.

There is one potential backward compatibility. With all_tenants specified,
non-admin accounts will get back owned servers only without this patch,
however it will get policy exception now if policy checking failed. IMHO
the new behaviour makes more sense.

Fixes bug 1052696.

Update the compute manager to pass network_info and block_device_info
to the driver.resume() and update all virtualization drivers to accept
the new arguments.

For libvirt, change resume() to use _create_domain_and_network()
rather than _create_domain(). This eliminates the assumption that the
network and block device connections remained in place from the period
between the VM being suspended and resumed.  Instead, all the
networking and block connections will be rebuilt on resume (in case
they are missing) as is the case after a hypervisor reboot.

We always launch dnsmasq with FLAGFILE set, so something is very broken
if FLAGFILE isn't set when nova-dhcpbridge is launched.

Also, the fallback to CONF.dhcpbridge_flagfile is a little strange - at
this point, we haven't parsed any config files so the only possible
value of this config option is its default value.

There's no real need to gracefully handle this condition either - a
KeyError is a straightforward enough error.

Commit d3fd05b1f accidentally removed the default for the compute_driver
option because the default has been removed for grizzly.

That commit isn't yet needed on stable/folsom, but will be needed by
the fix for #1061944 so rather than revert it we should fix it by
restoring the default value.
