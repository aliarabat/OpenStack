enable the reset snapshot state feature, We need a new tab for Snapshots
in the same manner as what's in Project Volumes. This submit is part 1

!!!!! WIP !!!!!!
The structure of our Volume Driver objects has become a bit of a mess
over time.  Originally we only had iSCSI and it was IET so we had a
base and used inheritance to add the needed iSCSI pieces.

Over time we've added a bunch of drivers, and a few more options not
only in terms of iSCSI helpers, but also protocols in general.  What
we have now is a mess.  We have a multiple inheritance model soley to
handle different protocols and helpers for those protocols.  We're also
in a state where we're *kinda* trying to seperate that, and *kinda* not.
So what we have is some rather convoluted code, alot of duplication and a
good deal of *dead* code.

The worst part of this is that simple things like intiialize_connection have
become very brittle and difficult to maintain and extend.  The iSCSI path
traverses across the LVMiSCSIDriver->volume/iscsi.py->LVMiSCSIDriver->brick/iscsi
and back and forth.

This patch is a POC for changing the model, rather than have this long
line of inheritance for the Volume Driver we seperate the topology/data-path
and the actual storage-object/control-path.

This allows you to have a single LVM driver, and utilize any type of connector
you choose to implement/import as a connector object (iSCSI variant, Fibre etc).
In addition it makes the connector items usable and extendable outside of the driver
itself.

Drivers still provide the interface for the connector related methods, but don't
implement them.  Instead the Volume driver implements a *has-a* relationship with
a Connector object which implements the data-path methods.

Currently this is a POC, LVM with TGTAdm works and passes Tempest tests.

To test with current new_drivers/lvm just add the following driver to your conf:
volume_driver = cinder.volume.new_drivers.lvm.LVMVolumeDriver

Next steps:
1. Get some cleanup and testing on ISER and LIO
2. Move out of new_drivers dir and replace current LVM and iSCSI drivers
3. Modify/Adjust 3'rd party drivers where necessary (hopefully the interface
   design used should limit the thrash here)
4. Add FC and Local connectors

A long, long time ago, on a GET request, the proxy would go look on 3*
nodes for the requested thing. If one of the primary nodes was
error-limited, it'd look on two primaries and a handoff. Since this
indicated some failure somewhere, the proxy would emit a warning:
""Handoff requested (1)"". If two primaries were down, there'd be a
second message ""Handoff requested (2)"", and so on.

Some StatsD messages were emitted too.

A somewhat shorter time ago (commit d79a67eb), the proxy started
looking into handoffs if it got 404s from the primaries. While this
was a good idea, it resulted lots of ""Handoff requested (N)"" log spam;
you'd see these messages on every single 404. Also, the StatsD
handoff_count and handoff_all_count metrics shot way up and turned
into noise.

This commit restores the original intent (and usefulness) of the log
messages and StatsD metrics: if the proxy only looks at the normal
number of handoff nodes, nothing is logged. However, if a primary is
down, then the message ""Handoff requested (1)"" will be logged,
indicating that the proxy looked at one more handoff than it normally
would, and this happened because a primary node was error-limited.

A lvremove -f might leave behind suspended devices
when it is racing with udev or other processes
still accessing any of the device files. The previous
solution of using lvchange -an on the LV had the
side-effect of deactivating origin LVs alongway in
the thick volume case, which was undesired.

It turns out retrying the deactivation twice and
ignoring the suspended devices on the second iteration
avoids the hang of all LVM operations after an initial
failure.

HTTPretty was great particularly when we were having to deal with both
httplib and requests together. Since that time the library itself has
caused a number of problems including backwards incompatible changes,
broken releases and some dependency issues that make it difficult to
package. There are also issues with memcache tests or anything else
that also tries to use the socket.

requests-mock does a very similar job, with a very similar interface
however it targets only requests and so doesn't have the same socket
issues and will be a much easier dependency on packagers.

keystoneclient is the first of a number of clients that will do the
changeover.

New tox (>=1.7.0) sets a random python hash seed by default. This is
generally good for testing because it will help keep projects working
regardless of the hash seed, but cinder unittests don't currently pass
with a random hash seed so set it to the python default seed.

This change will allow us to use new tox again and remove the
restriction on tox<=1.6.1 to run unittests.

Redundant setenvs for specific test envs are removed to prevent them
from overriding the PYTHONHASHSEED value.

Note this change will need to be backported to the stable branches to
keep unittests there working with new tox as well.

Add retype support to the HP 3PAR driver. The driver will modify the
volume's current userCPG, snapCPG provisioningType, and QOS settings, as
needed, to make the volume behave appropriately for the new type. The
existing retype framework handles what to do if the driver cannot retype
(when it returns False or raises an exception).

The combination of optional type-specified VV set, old-style scoped
extra-specs and QOS-specs will be resolved using existing code. So no
new interpretation of a mixed-up type specifications will be introduced
(no need to re-document these driver caveats).

Other than the usual validity checking, the 3PAR retype will have one
limitation. Retype will not be allowed if the volume has snapshots and
the retype would require modifying/tuning the snapCPG or userCPG.

When using version >= 2.2 of the MySQL module, setting up the database
for Keystone depended on the MySQL service (Service['mysqld']). However,
if the service is not managed by Puppet (e.g. it is managed through
Pacemaker instead), this would cause catalog compilation to fail because
there is no Service['mysqld']. This is the case when the MySQL module is
called with service_manage => false. Requiring Class['mysql::server']
instead fixes this.

Any user modification before standard system package creates the
user is wrong. Usecase of patch adding the user is also broken as
there are several other options: provide user before whole class
nova, have user id enforced by package or as most humans do accept
that in multi host enviroments there are 3 layers - user, group and
netgroup. In all cases nova puppet module should never touch the
user as it's provided by package on all supported systems, but for
backwards compatibility the management of user is disabled if
nova_group_id is undef or if nova_user_id is undef.

Previously, it was possible for someone to create a security group rule
where the rule references another security group. To do this nova would
first create the security group rule and then look up the referenced group
(group_id's) name in order to return that via the api. During this time
it's possible for someone to delete this security group rule and the
referenced group before the call returned resulting in a 404 error being
raised. This patch addresses this issue by looking up the group name
first and then creating the security group rule in order to avoid this
from occuring.

Note: this patch also adds a test to cover the case where an invalid group
id was passed though this does not really add any real additional coverage
to the change largely because the code is currently using global stubs. That
said, the previous coverage should hopefully be sufficient

    This message is more useful for diagnosis

In different deployment scenarios Puppet generates
different firewall rules and potentially can add
permit rule, which will allow access to unused or
secure ports/services. We should check iptables
for security holes on slaves:
 1. listen on admin interface on some unused port
    (tcp or udp);
 2. try to connect to that port from master node
    and send data;
 3. check that connection attempt was blocked and
    data was not received.

Since our upgrade tarball has both upgraders for master node and
openstack upgrader, we should provide a way to run only certain
ones. For instance, it's a very useful workflow when we can run
just openstack upgrader to test openstack patching.

Upgraders to run could be specified throughout special env variable,
which is widespread way to parametrize some process in Unix world:

Usage example:

    $ UPGRADERS='openstack' ./upgrade.sh

The command above will run just openstack upgrader, no matter which
upgraders was hardcoded in upgrade.sh.

This changeset introduces iniset_sudo, a root wrapper around the
devstack function, iniset.

The wrapper function makes it easier to have comments explaining
lines changes to configuration files.

Instead of sourcing the devstack library in the root environment as
well, iniset_sudo works on a temporary copy of the configuration file
and uses root privileges only to copy the result back into place. It
would have to be modified before it could edit files that the script
user has no permission to read.

The changeset illustrates the use of the function with a patched
apt_install_mysql.sh

Powering off a VM without giving the Guest Operating system a chance
to perform a controlled shutdown can lead to data corruption.

The proposed changes will make the default behavior for stop, rescue, resize,
and shelve to give the GuestOS a chance to perform a controlled shutdown
before the VM is powered off.

The change will encapsulate the complexity of signaling to and waiting for
the GuestOS in the hypervisor, and allow image owners the ability to tune
the associated timing via image metadata to take account of GuestOSs that
require an extended period to shutdown (such as Windows).

Users will be able to specify the shutdown behavior on a per operation basis
via a new shutdown_type parameter where, in keeping with the current reboot
operation, a ""soft"" shutdown will give the GuestOS a chance to perform a
clean shutdown, and a ""hard"" shutdown will cause an immediate power off.  The
default behavior will be a ""soft"" shutdown.

RabbitMQ: advance thru the list of brokers on reconnect

In RabbitMQ implementation, when using multiple rabbit_hosts, we don't want to
immediately retry failed connection for the same failed broker. This was not
the case in existing implementation though, where we've always attempted to
reconnect starting from the first broker in the list of candidates. So if the
first broker failed, we initiated reconnect to the same failed broker.

This change makes reconnect() implementation to select the next broker in the
list. This also means that non-failure reconnect attempts will also switch the
current broker. All in all, users should not rely on any particular order to
use brokers from the list, so this should not constitute an issue.

Code inspection around an exception found a piece of code handling an
error from execute_with_timeout() in a problematic way. A call was
made to delete a file and if the file did not exist,
execute_with_timeout() would throw an exception. However, 'rm' is not
very friendly, and only returns 0, -1, +1 and not errno
(ENOENT). Therefore the code was (literally) looking in stdout for the
string 'No such file or directory'.

The recommended way of handling missing files with rm is to use the
command line '-f' option which will suppress errors on nonexistent
files. The mechanism of searching for a literal string is not good for
a couple of reasons but the most significant two are that it requires
a thrown exception (which would get logged as an exception), and that
in languages other than English, the error string would be something
else (not 'No such file ...').

A test to ensure that wipe_ib_logfiles() properly suppressed the
exception is now redundant and has been deleted.

If the libvirt driver has not been configured to use KVM, then
the libguestfs module should be forced to use TCG. This is
particularly important when running Nova inside a VM, which
might claim to have VMX/SVM support when it is in fact broken.
This will avoid libguestfs hanging in such scenarios.

'rbd list' CLI returns error code when there are no rbd volumes, which
causes problems during live migration of VMs with RBD backed ephemeral
volumes. It's safer to use the library that only raises an exception in
case of a real problem.

The only case where rbd CLI is still justified is import, which is
needed to correctly import sparse image files.

All code related to cleanup of RBD volumes is moved to rbd.py, this
fixes a yo-yo problem with single-use methods scattered across 3
different files, and minimizes impact of this fix on imports in
imagebackend and utils.

On some drivers CHAP credentials are tied to accounts
which may be unique for each OS and/or backend Tenant.

For example:
  Volume is created with project_id xyz
  Backend creates an account for xyz with specific CHAP

  Volume is transferred to project_id abc

Currently we don't update the model_info, so even though
on the backend we updated the owner and CHAP settings we
never propogated that back up to the DB object so the volume
can't be used by the new owner.

This patch just adds an option to return model_update
on the accept_transfer call to the driver and updates
the db accordingly.

Also adds a call in the SF driver to actually get the
new model info to be fed back to the manager.

This patch will allow properly configured Glance servers to return a temporary
URL for an object hosted on Swift. It will require Glance to use Swift
as its backend. A temporary URL allow a deploy driver to download an image
from Glance without requiring an auth_token, which gives access more than
just Glance. This requires a set of config options: the Glance endpoint URL,
a shared secret temporary key, and the account configured in Glance to talk
to Swift with, which owns the container images are stored in.

A later patch will explore using the direct_url in Glance to simplify the
config options.

We/I need to add a note in the docs about Swift being a possible dependency
for Ironic deploys using IPA, along with how to set the Temp URL key.

Swift performance concerns will be addressed in this blueprint:

does these sequentially, and sometimes a volume could be deleted under
it, causing a bad stacktrace. This will gracefully handle those
situations and move on. Added coverage for resume volume delete being
successful as well.

Previously the policy runtime utilized a handful of special-purpose
interacting theories.  The intent was to explore a number of different options
for monitoring and enforcement.  But for our current focus on
simply monitoring, interacting theories is overly complex; moreover,
it makes it difficult to support multi-tenancy.

This change removes the interacting theories from the policy runtime.
Now every policy is isolated from every other policy. This also
makes multi-tenancy possible.  We've chosen to use the Nonrecursive
Theory as the default.  This avoids stale-state bugs likely
to appear in MaterializedViewTheory, which seems to be a
problem currently.

Sometimes the policy runtime creates new tables from existing table
names.  When it does so for a tablename that references an external
datasource, e.g. neutron:ports, it leaves the datasource prefix
in tact.  This causes the DSE incarnation of the policy engine
to try to create a data source with a non-existent data source
name.

This fix checks if the table-name is auto-generated before
trying to spin up a datasource service.

Every time Neutron is queried for its

converts that information to tuples, even
if the data is exactly the same as it was
previously.

This change only runs the conversion to
tuples when the data is different than
it was previously.  This has the benefit
that bug #1344475 has less impact

It is only very slightly less of a security issue to expose
Token IDs in the logs than it is to expose password details. This
change obscures the Token ID in the debug output in all cases to
ensure that the ID is not presented in any of the logs that could
be read by a unprivileged source (e.g. lower priv log watchers,
centralized logging, etc).

The main use case is to ensure that it is possible to correlate a
token to the various requests made. In some cases this has shown
where a token has expired (tokens weren't properly refreshed).
This use case for debugging eliminates simple redaction of the
token id from the logs.

SHA1 is no longer allowed as a hashing mode for CMS token hashing.
This is because SHA1 is being used to obscure tokens in the
session object debug. This is done to  prevent the debug output
from being potentially exposing a valid token (PKI->sha1-short-id)
in some configurations of Keystone / auth_token middleware.

The raw data elements from the token (e.g. user, roles, expiration
etc) could be added into debug/trace level logging at a future time.

When no samples have been handled by the aggregator but flush method is
called, an empty array must be returned because 'initial_timestamp' have
not been set yet.

Also, the pipeline always catchs exception from transformer and when an
error occurs into a transformer the unit can not catch them.
The patch also reraises any transformer exceptions.

Includes ""Don't match editor backup files in environment"" and ""Order
execution of environment.d scripts"". These had to be squashed because
the first change alone changes the order env.d scripts are sourced in.

The current glob match for environment files can source editor backup
files (foo.bash~) which will override the real changes you have made.
Other parts use the regex to avoid matching such files, so do
the same for environment file matching.  Note this has to match "".""
unlike the other regex, as most env files are ""foo.bash""

Also sort the files before sourcing them to ensure a reliable order.
This change should be in line with current expectations, given the
convention is to numerically prefix scripts in this directory.

Python 3 introduced a next() function to replace the next()
method on iterator objects. Rather than calling the method on the
iterator, the next() function is called with the iterable object
as it's sole parameter, which calls the underlying __next__() method.

As the next() function was backported to Python 2.6, we can
use it either in the 2.x or 3.x simultaneously - that's why
six.next() usage was also removed from the source code.

New tox (>=1.7.0) sets a random python hash seed by default. This is
generally good for testing because it will help keep projects working
regardless of the hash seed, but ceilometer unittests don't currently
pass with a random hash seed so set it to the python default seed.

This change will allow us to use new tox again and remove the
restriction on tox<=1.6.1 to run unittests.

Redundant setenvs for specific test envs are removed to prevent them
from overriding the PYTHONHASHSEED value.

Note this change will need to be backported to the stable branches to
keep unittests there working with new tox as well.

When using version >= 2.2 of the MySQL module, setting up
the database for Keystone depended on the MySQL service
(Service['mysqld']). However, if the service is not managed
by Puppet (e.g. it is managed through Pacemaker instead),
this would cause catalog compilation to fail because there
is no Service['mysqld']. This is the case when the MySQL
module is called with service_manage => false. Requiring
Class['mysql::server'] instead fixes this.

right way to pin versions, instead requirements repo should be used to
propagate version requirements to all projects.

Such incorrect pinning results in attempts to remove the pin during the

During the refactoring of the conductor_workers parameter from nova::api
to nova::conductor, the conductor_workers default changed from
$::processorcount to the parameter being absent.

While this is consistent with the nova default behaviour, it changes the
value for people who currently have a different default set. The solution is
to do nothing, in case no value is given.

This change fixes translations to be using correct translation functions.
Contains few log level drops for too high logging levels.

This PS does not address logging changes for modules under glance/store/
due to the new repo request. After stores are moved to their own repo
new PS will be submitted for those.

This PS does not touch the test code.

Separate PS will be submitted for log lever raises withing codebase

This patch adds an osbash support library for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

It allows osbash to build basedisks based on that distribution.

The patch also documents the new option in localrc.

Note that the new library differs from the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS version only
in the URL of the ISO image. The URL could be passed as an argument and
both libraries merged. Such a refactoring can be undertaken later on,
should we keep adding libraries we almost identical content.

Also note that these libraries do not pass bashate (formerly know as
bash8). Maybe we can find a better way to store the boot argument string
that is bashate conformant, readable/editable, and correct code.

This draft represents a combination of the work done in two earlier
versions of the resolution ([anteaya][eglynn]) and notes from the
TC meeting on 8 July 2014 ([logs][markmc]).

This version adds details based on the background for each position,
so that readers who have not followed the discussion will have a
better understanding of why we are talking about these issues. It
also tries to provide a clear reporting structure and cover some
of the technicalities of who can administer the election while some
members of the TC are running.

It also focuses on resolving issues amicably and educating the
community, rather than publicizing faults in a way that may punish
someone harshly for a simple mistake. I think this is in keeping
with the ""benefit of the doubt"" attitude I sensed from the most
recent meeting.
