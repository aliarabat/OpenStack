sudo requires a tty to function by default on centos. Instead of
tweaking the sudo conf we can just add a tty. This has the added
advantage of making the containers more friendly if you have to
`docker exec -i <container> bash` into them.

According to debian bug 728775 [1] apt-get by design will consume stdin
(even when not run interactively).

When the run-aio-build.sh script is used as part of a curl-pipe-bash
such as described in the quick start docs [2] apt-get will effectively
halt execution of the script after installing git. The next time the
script is run it will get past the step because git is now installed and
apt-get no longer consumes stdin. In addition to run-aio-build.sh,
bootstrap-aio.sh and bootstrap-ansible.sh call apt-get and so exhibit
the same behaviour when called by run-aio-build.sh when used as part of
a curl-pipe-bash.

In addition to apt-get install -y, apt-get purge -y exhibits the same
behaviour.

The result for the end user is they must run the command multiple times
to get it to work.

Using the bash method to close stdin (0<&- [3]) causes apt-get to print
out ""E: Write error - write (14: Bad address)"" and fail. The solution is
to explicitly set stdin to nothing, such as ""echo '' | apt-get ..."" or
""apt-get ... < /dev/null"". The latter is chosen for its aesthetics.

yum install -y does not exhibit this behaviour and so does not require
its stdin redirected.

Murano doesn't handle request properly if it is behind an SSL
termination proxy. In this case HTTP redirection and returned URLs
use http instead of https.

New middleware helps to handle the situation below properly. The purpose of the
SSLMiddleware is to update the wsgi.url_scheme environment variable of
the request with the value contained in an HTTP header that can be
configured in the configuration file (by default: 'X-Forwarded-Proto')

This was a chance introduced by 286a6ea, and since it invalidated

Make test_server work with older versions of oslo.service

Change I18a11283925369bc918002477774f196010a1bc3 fixed the test for
oslo.service >= 0.10.0, but it also broke it for older versions of
oslo.service. Since the library has minimal version of >= 0.7.0 in
requirements.txt, test should pass for those versions too.

Now, instead of validating that either reset() or restart() of workers
are triggered on SIGHUP, just validate that .start() is triggered the
expected number of times (either way, no matter how oslo.service decide
to clean up the children, they exit and then are respawned).

Fixed multiple py34 gate issues

1. Scope mock of 'open' to module

By mocking 'open' at the module level, we can avoid affecting
'open' calls from other modules.

2. Stop using LOG.exception in contexts with no sys.exc_info set

Python 3.4 logger fills in record.exc_info with sys.exc_info() result
[1], and then it uses it to determine the current exception [2] to
append to the log message. Since there is no exception, exc_info[1] is
None, and we get AttributeError inside traceback module.

It's actually a bug in Python interpreter that it attempt to access the
attribute when there is no exception. It turns out that it's fixed in
latest master of cPython [3] (the intent of the patch does not seem
relevant, but it removes the offending code while reshuffling the code).
Note that now cPython correctly checks the exception value before
accessing its attributes [4].

The patch in cPython that resulted in the failure is [5] and is present
since initial Python 3k releases.

The patch in fixtures that broke us is [6].

Version 2 requires passing in more flags

The 'max_environments' setting of [networking] group in murano
configuration file defines the maximum number of networks which may be
created by murano for any given router, thus eventually limiting the
number of environments to simultaneously co-exists within a tenant.

The previous default (20) was very low, and it was causing CIDR
conflicts even when the actual number of envs was not reaching the
limit.

This change increases the number of CIDRs allowed for environment
networks, thus reducing the probability of CIDR conflict.

NOTE: This change just reduces the risk of conflicts but does not
eleminate it completely.

The Drivers team realized that with the current model, RFE
bugs were never off their radar even though RFE proposals were
approved and ready to be worked on. As a result it was becoming
tricky to handle the RFE backlog during the drivers meeting.

These changes are aimed at keeping the list of RFE bugs to a
manageable size, irrespective of how fast code gets submitted
and merged: the responsibilities of vetting feature proposals
and reviewing code are very much different, and this policy
changes try to reflect that.

Liberty is behind us. The RFE process has been in place for a cycle
and some refinements have been necessary to make it more streamlined.

The cut-over section has outlived its purpose so it can be removed.
In its place, this patch clarifies how we are going to track RFE in
Launchpad, once the RFE has been 'approved'.

The tl;dr version of this patch is: from Mitaka onwards, feature
submission must happen via RFE bug report submission. Launchpad
blueprints are going to become a tool to be used at discretion of
the project release manager for milestone tracking purposes.

This adds a keyword argument ""return_dict"" to the server side of
the vendor_passthru and driver_vendor_passthru RPC methods,
defaulting to False. The RPC client passes True if it can send
version 1.29, and False otherwise. If return_dict is True, it
will return the dict response that was introduced in version
1.29, and if False will return the tuple response that existed
before 1.29.

By having return_dict default to False if not passed, RPC clients
that are not yet at 1.29 will be compatible with a server at 1.29
or above. This removes a major blocker to doing rolling upgrades,
though it is important to note that rolling upgrades are not yet
officially supported.

Note that we do *not* bump the RPC version for this change, as
doing so would defeat the purpose of this bugfix.

A network hardware might take a while to initialize (due to loading
firmware, STP, hardware VLAN filtering initialization, etc). Therefore
setup-bootdev should retry to find out the boot interface name instead
of giving up immediately, chances are that the hardware hasn't been
initialized yet.

Murano doesn't handle request properly if it is behind an SSL
termination proxy. In this case HTTP redirection and returned URLs
use http instead of https.

New middleware helps to handle the situation below properly. The purpose of the
SSLMiddleware is to update the wsgi.url_scheme environment variable of
the request with the value contained in an HTTP header that can be
configured in the configuration file (by default: 'X-Forwarded-Proto')

This patch fixes the bug that Kuryr deletes the default subnets
associated with the subnet pools for Kuryr specified in the config
file.

By default Kuryr creates the default subnets with the subnet pools. When
users delete the Docker endpoint, Kuryr deleted the default subnets.
However, the default subnets are used when users don't specify the CIDRs
for interfaces when they create Docker endpoints, so it's a better design
not to delete them.

The following patch adds a callback from neutron to nova that notifies nova
when a port for an instance is *ready to be used*. After nova receives this
event it will then start the instance in a hope that when it comes up
its networking should be in working order.

NOTE: *ready to be used* currently means that a plugin changes the status
in the db associated with a port from:
NO_VALUE/PORT_STATUS_DOWN/PORT_STATUS_ACTIVE to ACTIVE/ERROR.

Neutron will then signal nova: network_vif_plugged:<status> where status
will either be 'completed' or 'failed' given the neutron port status.

Neutron also notifies nova when a port goes from status:
PORT_STATUS_ACTIVE to PORT_STATUS_DOWN and sends nova a network_vif_unplugged
event.

Currently this patch breaks multiregion support (i.e previously you could
back multiple nova regions by one neutron server) though now since neutron
needs to notify nova we'll need to add a way to determine which region a
given port is in.

For now the work around for this would be to set: notify_nova_port_active=False
in neutron to prevent neutron from sending the notification and setting:
vif_plugging_is_fatal=False in nova.conf. Doing this will keep the current
interaction where an instance will be booted without waiting for the network
to be ready.

Use eventlet.green.subprocess if eventlet is used and enable eventlet
tests on Python 3.

This change adds oslo_rootwrap.subprocess which is
eventlet.green.subprocess if eventlet monkey-patching is enabled or
if the TEST_EVENTLET environment variable is set, or subprocess of
the Python standard library otherwise.

When eventlet is used (with monkey-patching or not), it's more
reliable to use eventlet.green.subprocess instead of using directly
subprocess from the Python standard library.

On Python 2, it ""works"" to use directly subprocess: subprocess.Popen
calls os.pipe() and os.fdopen(fd) which are both monkey-patched. On
Python 3, it doesn't work because subprocess uses os.pipe() and
io.open(fd), and the io module is *not* monkey-patched at all.

When running just 'glance' under python3, we will get the error:
ERROR: 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'func'

This is because map() is used to decode sys.argv, but under Python3
it returns a map object which is an iterable. Some code later tries
to use this in a boolean context and it will always return True,
even if it's empty.

At one point this was being done to enable running postconfig separate
from a deployment, but that plan was abandoned in favor of having
puppet do the postconfig.  It's still reasonable to factor out
generally useful code to a common place though.

Additionally, moving things into standalone functions makes them easier
to test independently. Yay easier testing!

The 'max_environments' setting of [networking] group in murano
configuration file defines the maximum number of networks which may be
created by murano for any given router, thus eventually limiting the
number of environments to simultaneously co-exists within a tenant.

The previous default (20) was very low, and it was causing CIDR
conflicts even when the actual number of envs was not reaching the
limit.

This change increases the number of CIDRs allowed for environment
networks, thus reducing the probability of CIDR conflict.

NOTE: This change just reduces the risk of conflicts but does not
eleminate it completely.

This changes defaults the behaviour to use the current branch of
devstack and each project, unless the corresponding environment
variable is set.

When support for variables such as TROVE_BRANCH was added, an
unintended side-effect was introduced.  In the use case of
testing a changeset by creating a new branch for the checkout,
redstack would switch the repo back to master, if the
TROVE_BRANCH variable was not explicitly set.  This forces the
developer/tester to set the variable - if they forget they will
end up inadvertently testing the master branch.

For example, doing the following would not give the
expected result:

cd /opt/stack/trove
git fetch ssh://<fetch_cmd> && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
git checkout -b new_branch
cd ~/trove-integration/scripts
./redstack install

Redstack in this case would switch the repo back to master,
so you would need to remember to add 'TROVE_BRANCH=newbranch'
before the install command.

This fix makes sure that the repo is only switched if one of the
variables is actually set.

Manila is broken is threee places, so fix them:
1) test 'test_misc' with WebOb 1.5

WebOb 1.5 was released at 2015-10-11. With this new version,
webob.exc.WSGIHTTPException() constructor now fails with a KeyError
when the HTTP status code is 0.

test_exceptions_raise() of test_misc tries to instantiate all
exceptions of manila.exception. The problem is that
ConvertedException uses a default HTTP status code of 0.

Modify the default HTTP status code of ConvertedException to 400 to
fix the unit tests.

2) Add dependency for 'testresources' that is required by migration
tests.

3) Remove 2 unit tests related to testing of oslo.policy lib
functionality that should not be tested in Manila. It started failing
because under-the-hood behaviour was changed in new realese 0.12.0

Example in document for Kubernetes Load Balancer.

In the example, the commands to manually associate a floating IP
to the LB VIP uses grep on ""TCP"" to find the VIP from the neutron

grep now returns 2 entries instead of just the entry for the LB.
This in turn gives an error in the next command.

The vSCSI physical volume may hit an issue if there is an hdisk without
a UDID.  The connect flow handles this and will not map.  Which then
causes a revert.  However, during the revert the code tries to remove
the hdisk.  This causes a significant issue.

This change set detects this path by adding a flag to check if udid is
None.  If so, it presents a warning message to the operator.  It then
allows the revert flow to continue properly.

* then stop is called, try to get the lock to stop the executor

Fix test_misc for WebOb 1.5

WebOb 1.5 was released at 2015-10-11. With this new version,
webob.exc.WSGIHTTPException() constructor now fails with a KeyError
when the HTTP status code is 0.

test_exceptions_raise() of test_misc tries to instanciate all
exceptions of cinder.exception. The problem is that
ConvertedException uses a default HTTP status code of 0.

Modify the default HTTP status code of ConvertedException to 400 to
fix the unit test. The bug is only in the test,
cinder/api/openstack/wsgi.py copies an existing HTTP code:

    Fault(exception.ConvertedException(code=ex_value.code,  ...)

assertEqual expects that the arguments provided to it should be
(expected, observed).If a particluar order is kept as a convention,
then it helps to provide a cleaner message to the developer if Unit Tests
fail. There are several Unit Test files where the arguments for assertEqual
have been swapped. This commit fixes the issue in lbaas.

This change adds in support for the novnc console type in Nova.

* The change adds in a few new variables to the defaults which allow
  for the novnc console to be configued.
* A port entry was added to haproxy to support the console type.
* noVNC is being installed from source in the nova_console container.
  The git repo has been added to the openstack_other.yml repo-package file
  which allows for the repo to be cloned into the repo containers and then
  distributed out where needed from within the environment.

This cherry-pick was modified to remove the ""vnc"" section because that
configuration option within nova was not backported to kilo in upstream
nova.

Add a json attribute to CreatedResponse and JSONResponse of
openstack_dashboard.api.rest.utils.

This patch changes unit tests: they now compare deserialized JSON
data instead of comparing the serialized JSON data which depends on
the exact hash function

This change makes the code more readable, but it was written to port
openstack_dashboard to Python 3. On Python 3, the hash function is
now randomized by default, so dictionary items are serialized in a
random order by JSON. Moreover, the hash function is different on
Python 2 and Python 3, so setting PYTHONHASHSEED=0 in tox.ini is not
enough to have a reliable JSON serialized ouput in all cases.

Fix also NaNJSONEncoder: On Python 3, don't try to decode bytes from
the encoder encoding, since the JSON encoder has no more encoding on
Python 3: it produces an Unicode string.

Version discovery was found to break deployments using proxies, so it was
reverted. This was introduced in python-cinderclient 1.2.0, persisted in
1.2.1 and 1.2.2, and reverted in 1.3.0 . The 1.2.? versions make note of this
in the release notes, and docs generated from release notes will now warn the

To pass the tests in gate, this commit has 2 separate changes

1) OS_TENANT_NAME is no longer used in the latest devstack, it causes all
datasource driver fail, as well as jenkins gate failure.

This fix changes devstack to use OS_PROJECT_NAME

2) Previously, we tested oslo.policy by mocking out one of the internals
of oslo.policy, just like Neutron.  Besides being improper, the newest
release of oslo.policy broke that test, which is what is blocking
the tip of master currently.

This fix shamelessly copies the fix out of Neutron, mocking out
at the layer of HTTPCheck.

oslo.service. Since the library has minimal version of >= 0.7.0 in

Now, instead of validating that either reset() or restart() of workers
are triggered on SIGHUP, just validate that .start() is triggered the
expected number of times (either way, no matter how oslo.service decide
to clean up the children, they exit and then are respawned).

When publishing samples with sample pipeline, it will check
the samples supported by the source definition of the pipeline
or not. But the samples from polling agent are always supported
by the pipeline because when setup polling tasks, the pollster
had been checked and matched corresponding pipeline. This check
has no affect of the publishing result if the sample come from
polling agent, but will cost cpu resources if we have a complex
pipeline definition. This commit add code in sample pipeline to
check the sample come from polling agent or not, if so, the
support check will be skipped.

Manila is broken is threee places, so fix them:
1) test 'test_misc' with WebOb 1.5

WebOb 1.5 was released at 2015-10-11. With this new version,
webob.exc.WSGIHTTPException() constructor now fails with a KeyError
when the HTTP status code is 0.

test_exceptions_raise() of test_misc tries to instantiate all
exceptions of manila.exception. The problem is that
ConvertedException uses a default HTTP status code of 0.

Modify the default HTTP status code of ConvertedException to 400 to
fix the unit tests.

2) Add dependency for 'testresources' that is required by migration
tests.

3) Remove 2 unit tests related to testing of oslo.policy lib
functionality that should not be tested in Manila. It started failing
because under-the-hood behaviour was changed in new realese 0.12.0

-- squashed with another change to get tests to pass on stable/liberty --

Fix broken unit tests

With release of six module version 1.10.0 several our unit tests
started to fail because of usage of not strict constructions.

Changes:
1) Manila unit test
""manila.tests.share.test_api.ShareAPITestCase.test_extend_quota_error""
used str for int substitution. So, use int data for int substitution.

2) Module 'manila.share.drivers.hp.hp_3par_mediator' was using
LOG.exception function when no traceback were exist it led to
AttributeError on py34. So, replace all usages of 'LOG.exception'
with 'LOG.error' where no raised exceptions exist.

The python persister needs to do the same.

The following element names in the alarm state transition

subAlarmExpression -> sub_alarm_expression
metricDefinition -> metric_definition
alarmState -> alarm_state

These elements originate from the Monasca Threshold Engine.
Ideally, the Threshold Engine should be modified to send

Now we(Tempest team) are migrating common part of Tempest to tempest-lib
for running Tempest-like test on each project repository.
That work requires the latest tempest-lib. So this patch bumps minimum
tempest-lib version.

NOTE (gmann) - Tempest-lib req should be updated on each stable branch as
Tempest is branchless and need to support all stable branches.

The test test_password_prompted() was expecting a keystone failure, but
because of an error in the requests/urllib3 library it was returning a
different exception and causing our tests to fail, see[1].

Independent of the the problem above on tests we should not rely on some
external library failing like that, we should mock this failures to make
our tests more reliable and that's what this patch is doing.

This patch includes the following updates based on the updated source in
Glance's Liberty release:
 - glance-api-paste.ini
 - glance-api.conf
 - glance-registry-paste.ini
 - glance-registry.conf
 - glance-cache.conf
 - glance-manage.conf
 - glance-scrubber.conf

The following defaults have their values changed based on new defaults for the
Liberty release. Note that any user_variables.yml values that have been set to
customise these will need to be reviewed and adjusted accordingly for liberty.
 - glance_digest_algorithm

Note also that the glance_swift_store_auth_version has been set to use '3' as
the default, meaning that it will use Keystone's v3 API as the default.

New configurable options:
 - glance_swift_store_auth_version
   This is the Keystone API auth version to use. The previous default
   was 2, but this patch changes it to 3.

 - glance_swift_store_user_domain
   This is the Domain ID for the user used to authenticate to Swift.

 - glance_swift_store_project_domain
   This is the Domain ID for the project used to authenticate to Swift.

Note that the policy.json file included is not the same as the upstream
default. Changes have been included which improve the security of image
publication and image group membership.

Metadefs have no 'name' field (because they use namespace),
which matches their data, but since name will likely be a
common sort field it will potentially cause problems with sort.

When doing cross resource searching on name (no type specified),
the current queries result in zero results being returned if
1) OS::Glance::Metadef are specified first or
2) no types are specified (the server automatically adds all the
   types to the query to elasticsearch.

There is no reason to hold off on naming releases one we know their
location. And holding off on release naming is more likely to create
confusion where the dev community just picks a placeholder, uses it in
communication, and that placeholder is wrong later.

Especially as projects are now moving into a phase of planning for
multiple releases in advance for larger efforts, the current
restriction just adds confusion and cleanup work later.

There are currently 3 different blocking issues in stable/liberty due
to library releases: webob 1.5, oslo.db 3.0.0, and
oslo.versionedobjects 0.11.0. This is a squashed fix for all of them
as none can land without the others.

Issue #1 - oslo.db

Add testresources used by oslo.db fixture

If we use oslo.db fixtures, we'll need the package or
the next version of oslo.db release will break us.

(Cherry-picked from 4bcc26487837b7ece7797f88622dea1b6d09bd94)

Closes-Bug: #1503501

Issue #2 - oslo.versionedobjects

Drop unused obj_to_primitive() override

This was a band-aid override until o.vo gained the obj_relationships fix
that this method overrides. That has been in place since o.vo 0.8.0, which
means this is long since no longer necessary (and is actually blocking our
ability to absorb bug fixes to this code in o.vo). Further, we no longer
use this directly because we're doing backports based on version manifests,
which means we no longer consult child_versions _or_ obj_relationships.

(cherry picked from commit 142f1d9cc4ace90956c665c40b1f78795f9f7e29)

Issue #3 - webob

Default ConvertedException code to 500

webob 1.5.0 released on 10/11 has change f6c749011 which
strictly enforces status codes in exceptions, and 0 is not
a valid status code so tests fail.

Change the default to 500 to match the default in the parent
class in webob.

On my Macbook Pro (~2012 2.9GHz Intel Core i7 - four logical cores),
with multiprocessing:
$ time bandit -r ~/repo/nova ~/repo/glance ~/repo/keystone
real    0m33.926s
user    1m52.437s
sys 0m0.787s

Using current bandit master without multiprocessing:
$ time bandit -r ~/repo/nova ~/repo/glance ~/repo/keystone
real    1m11.314s
user    1m10.613s
sys     0m0.529s

Minimal refactoring was performed - some BanditManager logic was moved
from instance-level to class-level functions to allow them to be passed
into multiprocessing map_async() with minimal complexity. The progress
indicator displayed during interactive runs was also killed to keep the
solution simple.

To discuss:
 - Testing?  (For a start, it passes all current tox tests.)
 - Make sure we're okay with default behavior (I personally quite like
   not having to think about it :) ), or consider multiprocessing
   elements that might be tweaked or made optional.
 - Look at options for bringing back progress indicator, although I'm
   wondering if that will be missed.

This commit adds basic metric generation to Bandit. Specifically, it
counts LOC and #nosec instances associated with a run.  It also exposes
a total count of issues identified, by severity & confidence level.

It includes functional testing against several existing example scripts.

It does *not* do anything with the results other than send them to the
logger.debug() facility.  Inclusion in Bandit output formats is left for
a separate commit.

There are also quite likely additional metrics that we will want to add
at a future date.

Previously the wsgi_script openstack-health entry point was pointing
directly to flask app object in the api module. However the script
constructed by pbr attempts to call app and set that as the
application for mod_wsgi. However this is the incorrect usage for a
flask app, and will fail because the app object isn't expected to be
called by itself without any args) Also, according to the flask docs
[1] you just need to set the flask app as the application var in the
to run with mod_wsgi. This commit fixes the wsgi_script entrypoint by
creating a wrapper function which can be called by the generated
output of wsgi scripts from pbr and will return the flask app. This
function is then used as the wsgi_script entrypoint instead of the app
itself. Additionally, this also gives a good injection point if there
are any future initialization or configuration steps that need to be
taken when running.

Since os_client_config started pulling in ksa plugins we have some
duplicate behaviour with OSC.  If o-c-c is going to be loading auth
plugins OSC needs a way to hook into the notch between setting config
values and actually loading the plugins in order to maintain existing
behaviours for compatibility.

It may also be desirable at some point to defer the plugin loading,
OSC did that orignally due to ksc's poor load times, ksa shouldn't
have the same problem.

The config option ""[serial_console].enabled"" is used as a switch by
the libvirt driver to determine if EITHER the instance log file OR
the serial console should be created as a device for the guest.
Over the last months I was not able to get an answer why this design
was chosen. Frankly, I believe that it is a bug. Because I couldn't
find any ""prove"" that the current implementation is ""wrong"", I have
chosen the ""blueprint way"" to commit this change.

To be precise: If cloud admins set the compute node config option
""[serial_console].enabled"" to ""True"", they prevent that the REST API
for the ""os-getConsoleOutput"" action for guests on these compute nodes
will return anything (because nothing gets logged). End users, who call
that REST API, will sometimes get a result and sometimes not, depending
on the configuration of the host where the instance gets scheduled to.

This patch set will allow the creation of BOTH devices (log file AND
serial console) for the guest. Which means that the REST API action
""os-getConsoleOutput"" will return a result, even if the ""serial console""
feature was enabled or not.

UpgradeImpact:
Instances, which get launched on compute nodes which have this patch,
will have 2 devices (""tcp"" AND ""file"") instead of the 1 device
(""tcp"" OR ""file"") they get without this patch. Existing instances
which get migrated to a patched host, won't get the additional device
unless they get rebuild. Guests which were already built with multiple
serial devices (through flavor extra specs or image metadata) could
exceed the upper limit of 4 serial devices after a rebuild. Due to
bug 1425640, which says that the REST API only returns the very first
serial console device, I believe that this is not yet really exploited
by customers.

The instance_manager's current caching of instance_info only happens
once and is never refreshed.  This causes update_state() to not notice
a backing instance is gone until it fails a API liveliness check.

This fixes it by updating the instance_info on every run of ensure_cache(),
in the same way it does for the router_obj.  This will properly detect
a backing instance is gone and rebuild the router without the slow
failing liveliness check.

Fixing this introduces a race where we try to check the API server of
a booted instance that does not yet have ports associated.  This also
fixes this by considering instances with no management port to still
be in the booting state.

Currently value of `my_ip' config option is used as image cache dir
prefix to prevent races between nova-compute instances using the same
datastore.

The common practice of making nova-compute (with vmwareapi driver
chosen) HA is to have it run in active/passive mode controlled by
Pacemaker.  In that case Pacemaker can move nova-compute instance to
another host, should something happen to the original one, which
effectively will cause change of the IP address - thus, all cached
images will have to be re-downloaded again, despite the fact they are
still there in the datastore and still belong to this particular
nova-compute instance.

I02e758af19cf3a652a5c39d02904e73a1088fe60 made it possible to use the
`cache_prefix' config option to denote, which cache directory should
be used by a particular nova-compute instance. As long as we set the
same `cache_prefix' value for all nova-compute processes running in
active/passive mode, the cache directory will be the same on every
host.

This change makes modified code compatible with Python 3.

Replace six.types.BooleanType with bool and six.types.FloatType with
float. types.BooleanType and types.FloatType were removed on
Python 3, but bool and float types are available on Python 2 and
Python 3.

By the way, six.types is simply the types module. No need to
get it from the six module.

These two modules were renamed in Python 3 (to http.client and
builtins). Use six.moves to have code working on Python 2 and
Python 3.

On Python 2, there is a little overhead to create a temporary list,
but it was decided that it is negligible:

string.letters was removed on Python 3, whereas string.ascii_letters

By the way, string.letters is modified when the LC_CTYPE locale is
modified by locale.setlocale(). Hopefuly, Solum doesn't call
locale.setlocale().
