Instead of saving task state in a class variable that is later
introspected by further test code just remove that concept (which
doesn't work in multiprocessing or worker engines which can not
have access those types of shared/globally available concepts due
to how they run) and use a specialized listener that can gather the same
information in a more decoupled manner (and it will work in multiprocessing
and worker engines correctly).

This allows our engine test cases to work in those engine types which
increases those engines test coverage (and future coverage and engine tests
that are added).

Fixes a bunch of occurrences of bug 1357117 as well that were removed
during this cleanup and adjustment process...

A few bugs were discovered when working with multiple backend servers.

- Update status for a domain/server is only created after the domain has
  been successfully added to the server.  This ensure MDNS is only called
  for servers with created domains.
- When calculating consensus, the calculation is based on the number of
  servers, not the number of Pool Manager status objects.
- Consensus calculations are done in Decimals, not floats.
- The same code is reused to create domains on failure as is used to create
  domains the first time.
- The same code is reused to delete domains on failure as is used to delete
  domains the first time.
- Unhandled exceptions are trapped if periodic recovery or periodic sync
  encounter them to prevent the threads from dying.  This is logged.

Currently the stack with cluster resource depending on cluster template
can not be deleted as the deletion of the cluster template fails since
actually the dependent cluster is not completely deleted yet.

This patch implements check_delete_complete for OS::Sahara::Cluster resource,
allowing the resource to wait until the actual Sahara cluster is deleted
before proceeding along dependency graph.

This is a simplified version of what's in master (where all of test.py
was broken up into fixtures, so backporting directly is way too
complicated).

The python warnings module allows you to dial down warnings by
type. This makes a particular warning only emit once per python run,
not on every function call.

Before sqlalchemy-migration >= 0.9.4, migrate reset the warnings
filters everytime migrations are run, so this has to run after any
database code in the setup (otherwise you could make this the first
like of setUp()).

When performing boot from Volume on none FS based devices or devices
that aren't also acting as Glance Image stores, the current process goes
like this:
1. Fetch the image from Glance Store to a temp file on the Cinder Node
2. Perform a qemu-img convert on that file (convert to raw)
3. Transfer the contents of that file to the newly created Volume using dd

This process can take a while and is pretty inefficient. This BP introduces
the option for Operators to enable image-caching on the SolidFire backend device.

When enabled this option will use the existing Cinder clone_image method,
and will create a ""Template Volume"" of minimum required size on the SolidFire
backend. This Volume will be created with a backend SolidFire account that can
be shared among OpenStack Tenants.

When a request is received we first do a number of checks before proceeding:
1. Is Image/Template caching enabled
2. Inspect the image-metadata and verify that the image is public,
   or that the tenant making the request is the owner
3. Verify that the image-metadata includes the properties['virtual_size']
   parameter

If the preconditions are met, create a minimal sized Volume with the requested
image; then use SolidFires clone operation to create the requested bootable
Volume. During the process we also check and make sure that the image hasn't
been updated since we created our cached copy, if it has we then delete the
copy we have on the system and create a new one.

Also updated those drivers with docstrings duplicating the params info.  I did
not rewrite or modify those that didn't include changed info.  I'm not sure we
should duplicate docstring info for base methods like this anyway, but that's
irrelevant for this work.

nova service-delete is handled by HostAPI.service_delete method.
Normally, it searches for relevant Service object in DB and calls
destroy() on it. However, in API cell it is over-ridden so that
service_delete message can be routed to appropriate cell. Once the
destination cell is reached, the message processor invokes
HostAPI.service_delete to perform the actual delete. This works in
case of child cells.
However in case of API cells, since HostAPI.service_delete has been
over-ridden, when the message processor invokes HostAPI.service_delete
to perform actual delete of the service, the API cell tries to again
route the message and fails in doing so with an AttributeError (as
the message is already at the destination cell and can not be further
routed).
This patch moves the object destroy() call to a separate function and
modifies the message processor to call the new function. The original
service_delete is modified to also call the new function.

The Notification Listener Tracker class is not threadsafe,
so when a test stop an already stopped listener this one
can be restarted, due to concurrency access of the threads list and
concurrency execution of the start/stop/wait method of the notification
listener.
This result of a lockup of the test or a listener can continue to
got unepxected message.

This change fixes that by never stop the tread with the tracker callback
but only manually with the test.

This test also rename some 'Listener' to 'Server', to not mismatch
the driver listener from the notification listener.

If the image is deleted by appropriate API call while its content
is still being uploaded, an exception is raised during metadata
update and it is not handled in the API code. This leads to the
fact that the uploaded image file stays in a storage and clogs it.

There existed code that safely removes image files if the exception
occurs, however it was executed only if the exception was
exception.NotFound. Now this code handles both exception.NotFound
and exception.Duplicate, which eventually triggers image content
deletion in the described case.

This spec adds support for dpdk accelerated ovs with the qemu vhost-user
port type to the neutron ml2 plugin.

Problem Description
===================

High volume workload such as telco workloads require throughput optimised
datapaths to deliver traffic to the guest. The standard kernel vhost
implementation is not able to provide adequate performance to support telco
workloads. The qemu vhost-user interface introduced in qemu 2.1 provides an
alternative userspace interface that could be used to support telco workloads
in combination with high throughput userspace vSwitches.

If Network contains dhcpv6-stateful Subnet with prefix other than /64,
dnsmasq refuses to start if prefix-len is not specified in dhcp-range
option.  From dnsmasq(8) manpage:

    For IPv6, the parameters are slightly different: instead of netmask
    and broadcast address, there is an optional prefix length which must
    be equal to or larger then the prefix length on the local interface.
    If not given, this defaults to 64. Unlike the IPv4 case, the prefix
    length is not automatically derived from the interface
    configuration. The mimimum size of the prefix length is 64.

It is safe to always specify prefix length, so dnsmasq will use correct
configuration.

If db.volume_get() fails here, volume_info (and chap_auth)

volume_get() failing is the only way to land in the NotFound

Move code not related to db lookup out of this try block, and

When server return a failure response, magnumclient will use the python
logging library to log the status. The library will attempt to log the
failure by finding a log handler to do the actual logging tasks. If there
is no log handler, no message will be logged and the error message below
will be printed.

No handlers could be found for logger ""magnumclient.common.httpclient""

In before, magnumclient did not add any log handler on non-debug mode,
which is a bug. This commit is for fixing that. It should be mentioned
that there is another commit 5b59253667a12a1b592d967bbcaa1f1adda559d3
(which has been reverted by 442e08b2895ad7eae29ce8ee7ffa0e4ba445f36c)
for addressing the same problem. However, this commit is a better fix since
it calls function basicConfig to add a default handler to root logger,
which ensure that there is always a handler globally.

fake_auth_provider needed fake_credentials which needs auth module which
needs keystone service clients for implementing fake get_credentials and
get_default_credentials. So this dependency blocked moving rest_client
module to tempest-lib because test_rest_client needs fake_auth_provider
like:

  rest_client
     -> test_rest_client
        -> fake_auth_provider
           -> fake_credentials
              -> auth
                 -> identity_client of v2 and v3
                    -> rest_client

So a dependency loop existed.
Both get_credentials and get_default_credentials of fake_auth_provider
were used in test_auth only.
So this patch moves fake get_credentials methods to test_auth for breaking
the dependency loop.

For target creation using tgtadm driver, we create a persistence
file for the target, then send a tgt-admin --update 'name' where
name is the specific persistence file we want to read in and update
from.

It turns out that we can hit race conditions where the persistence
file is written, and an update is requested but target has already
done work to make it believe that the target has already been created.

There are two ways this might be fixed:
1. Just catch the already exists exception, wait a second and retry
2. Try and use an update ALL instead of a targeted file

The update ALL option doesn't care what currently exists or is active,
it just reads everything in the persistence file and verifies there's a
target for each entry.  It should not reset or impact in-use targets
because we're not using the --force option.

NOT TO BE MERGED

I added some changes to the FSM-related code and modified/fixed some of the
unit tests, to hopefully show the issue with the fsm's use of _target_state
(and how that affects node.target_provision_state). The fsm's _target_state
doesn't always get updated, when it ""should"".

I went through all the patches in this series as well as all the states
and state transitions in the code, adding or fixing unit tests so that we have
complete (or more complete) coverage of all the code paths which include an
fsm.process_event().

Since there seem to be issues with getting the node's .target_provision_state
right (ie, with the values prior to the fsm change), wherever a unit test
specified a node's provision_state, I also added its corresponding
target_provision_state. Just in case. (So far, it seems like given a
provision_state, there is only one possible target_provision_state).

I didn't check if there are unit tests that provide full coverage of
task_manager.process_event(). (Although indirectly, I think the other unit
tests cover task_manager.process_event().)

With respect to the FSM, I was unable to find code paths that exercised the
following (from ironic.common.states.py):

  machine.add_state(DEPLOYDONE, target=ACTIVE, **watchers)
  machine.add_state(DELETED, target=NOSTATE, **watchers)
  machine.add_transition(NOSTATE, ERROR, 'error')
  machine.add_transition(DEPLOYING, ERROR, 'error')
  machine.add_transition(ACTIVE, ERROR, 'error')

Some unit tests will fail due to this. That is expected until we figure
out how to address them.

Some thoughts:
1. we may be able to get away without the fsm._target_state variable/logic.
I was wondering if we could use a state's 'target' information to determine
the desired ._target_state for the current state.

2. I was also thinking that if we could do 1, we might be able to get
away from even having/setting a node.target_provision_state, if that value
can be determined via the node's provision_state and the fsm.

3. I am wondering if we need to change the fsm to clearly indicate which
states are active vs momentary vs fail vs passive. We have explicit user
requests to go to certain states, but how do we eg transition from a
momentary (-ED) state to a passive state?

(I may have scattered other thoughts as comments through these changes.)

In trying to restructure the L3 agent in to more modules, some helpers
like arping will be used by several modules.  It is better to relocate
it to a common module which all of them will import and use.

Since there is only one spot which passed 'distributed=True', I chose
to break the utility in to two.  Also, 'distributed' doesn't really
describe what that argument is for.  So, I named the second utility
differently to indicate that it is for sending garps when proxyarp is
in use for the address on the interface.

The pip-download cache is deprecated and not functional since pip 6.0,
it should be removed.

Instead of the PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE variable this change
adds the PIP_EXTRA_ARGS variable, which makes possible to
use arbitrary pip argument including the --find-links,
which can be used for using pre downloaded
archives for installation:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#fast-local-installs

NOTES:
PIP_EXTRA_ARGS is not good for passing arguments including white spaces.
However most option can be configured in the pip.conf as well.

'PIP_FIND_LINKS' environment variable exists, where we could specify
multiple links separated by space, but the --find-links argument can be used
multiple times so handling spaces is not so important.
PIP_EXTRA_ARGS can be used for other arguments and can be
good enough for covering other than find-links use cases.

test_image_create_delete uses the new page navigation and checks basic
image creation and deletion.

Few other modifications I've made:
* horizon.conf - the image section, containing http accessible image,
  same as in tempest.conf.
* config.py - 'http_image' under the new ImageGroup

Commit 0045f7d50cad345c26ae02394ad57716b270d268 moved the headroom
calculation out of the DB API and into the compute API for when
instances go over quota (more specifically flavor information for an
instance create), but didn't update the nova-network manager code to
remove the usage of the headroom kwarg from the OverQuota exception
for logging.

This removes the usage of 'headroom' and also fixes the logging a bit so
the 'used' value makes more sense, where used = in_use + reserved.

This is the part of the more comprehensive split of
assignments, which rationalizes both the backend and controllers.
In order to make this change easier for reviewers, it is divided
into a number of smaller patches. Previous patches have:

- Moved role management into its own manager and drivers
- Fixed incorrect doc strings for grant driver methods
- Updated controllers to call the new role manager

This patch updates any tests that make calls to manager role to
call the new role manager.

Future patches will:
- Refactor the assignment manager and drivers enabling
  projects/domains to be split out
- Split projects and domains into their own backend
- Split the controllers so they call the correct manager
- Update the tests to call the new correct manager

This patch moves several methods in OVSBridge that don't really have
anything to do with OVS bridges to BaseOVS where they are a much
better fit. Since OVSBridge inherits from BaseOVS, no modules using
ovs_lib will have to change to support this move.

Also, several module-level functions that essentially re-implement
BaseOVS.run_vsctl() are moved to BaseOVS and converted to use
run_vsctl. In order to avoid changing the API, the module-level
functions are then reimplemented by creating a BaseOVS instance and
calling the associated method.

Rather than pointing the 'project usage list' entry point directly to
ListUsage, this makes a ListProjectUsage subclass to alias the desired
command and still allow for changing behaviour or issuing a deprecation
messages.  This implementation simply sets a new 'deprecated' attribute
in the command class that cliff will use to skip this command when
generating help output.

The actual skipping of the command in help output is dependant on
https://review.openstack.org/147349 merging in cliff, this review will
simply have no effect on help output until a version of cliff with
that update is present.

The deprecation message printed is somewhat generic until
https://review.openstack.org/147381 is merged in cliff.
Until that is merged, the deprecation message will not have the name
of the actual command given by the user in it, but rather the text
'this command'.

Fixes inability to assign different networks to
multi-nics when launching a vm using the cisco n1k plugin.

This fixes an issue wherein with the cisco n1k plugin
launching an instance with multiple nics via horizon causes the
same network to get assigned to all nics.

Additionally modifying the existing test_launch_instance_post
test to handle the situation wherein two nics are created
with the N1K plugin using the N1K policy profile. Hence a new
unit test reflects two ports being created. Two more unit tests
to test port create exceptions are added to test exception
handling as well.

Time sensitive services may not be able to startup and be synchronized,
specifically when deployed on multiple nodes, when the hardware clock
of the booting system is not explicitly synchronized before attempting
to start the services. With this, NTP itself may not be able to
synchronize and start operating if the clock is skewed too much from
the clock source(s), or if one clock source is out of sync itself.

This change move the ntp stand-up earlier in setup so that time of any
system is controlled befor time sensitive services startup. For example
the database on controller nodes. The change also set the clock to the
time of the given ntp server forcefully and updates the Hardware clock.
It also fixes the invalid ntp.conf file.

This is a simplified version of what's in master (where all of test.py
was broken up into fixtures, so backporting directly is way too
complicated).

The python warnings module allows you to dial down warnings by
type. This makes a particular warning only emit once per python run,
not on every function call.

Before sqlalchemy-migration >= 0.9.4, migrate reset the warnings
filters everytime migrations are run, so this has to run after any
database code in the setup (otherwise you could make this the first
like of setUp()).

Implement task templates based on jinja2.

This allow us to pass as a task jinja2 template
and it's argument via arguments --task-args and
--task-args-file that should be dict in JSON or YAML
presentations.

So now command looks like:

rally task start <file> --task-args <template-args-json-or-yaml> \
  --task-args-file <file-with-args-in-json-yaml>

If both --task-args and --task-args-file then file dict is updated
by task args file.

Extend rally CI performance job. Now we can set template args
via file with name: ${TASK}_args.yaml

Bonus:
* Better message on InvalidTask format
* Remove redudant catch of ""keyboardinterrupt""
  it should be implement in different way.
* Replace ' -> "" in rally.cmd.commands.task
  and tests.unit.cmd.commands.task
* Imporve a bit CLI messages on rally task start
* Remove old plot2html command (it's enough deprecated)
* Improve test coverage of rally/cmd/commands/task
* Fix rally/cmd/commands/validate return 1 if bad format
* Write errors to stderr (in whole cmd/commands/task.py)

Co-Authored-By: lianhao-lu <lianhao.lu@intel.com>

The first one is:

failure. Mock the executing engine completely to fix it.

Closes-bug:1410411
(cherry picked from commit 9307f9703191f527fbcb9bdae22c59d8911c407d)

The second one is:

the event api tests incorrectly reference a private attribute
from oslo_utils. this is not required and should not be done in
general. this patch changes this.

Change-Id: I03610078123edbe8ef89e8ea271d9c72ed4ba696
Closes-Bug: #1408737
(cherry picked from commit 160513ddb680ffb66758fb003c58a75b41a89785)

The third one is committed here directly as it is only relevant to
stable/juno:

Increase the amount of stderr read from 1024 to 2048 in test_bin.py

These test currently asserts a specific message is contained in the first
1024 bytes of the stderr message.  oslo_utils now spits a bunch of deprecation
messages that fill this quickly and the message being asserted on is cut off.
This bumps the read() from 1024 to 2048 to account for deprecation spam.

This reverts commit 8f190b9121715cc90c1d3269f146f1161623d271.

From Ian:
""So I spent most of today trying to figure out why Glance’s policy isn’t
working with the proposed glance policy changes for RBAC. I only was
just able to find (by adding tons of logging) the basic check is parsed
something like this

OrCheck
/     \
Role   GenericCheck

The RoleCheck is straight-forward and just works. Glance (in Juno) used
a very old and very hacky policy enforcement system that has been made a
lot better in oslo.policy (soon to be released). At the moment the
GenericCheck receives a target dictionary that is empty. So doing
something like tenant:%(tenant_id)s will return False immediately
because there is no tenant_id key in the dictionary passed in for the
target object (because it is empty). This seems to be a failure
somewhere along the line but I haven’t found it yet. Regardless, it
seems like the RBAC changes need to be reverted because there’s no
chance of them working until a new stable glance comes out with a fix.""

So I spent most of today trying to figure out why Glance’s policy isn’t
working with the proposed glance policy changes for RBAC. I only was
just able to find (by adding tons of logging) the basic check is parsed
something like this.

While the above is fine, `is_public` still remains a common accessed
property (feature) for consumers of the library. This patch adds an
`is_public` property to the Image schema that checks whether the visibility of
the image is set to `public` or not.

This is just a simple enhancement to improve the users' experience when

When a L3 agent starts up the initial full sync occurs
on the first periodic task interval.
This means that from the point the agent is ready to
process updates it can take ~1 minute until traffic
can start flowing through the L3 agent's routers.

When using a highly available solution (not VRRP)
the startup delay adds around a full minute to
the minimum downtime.

This patch simply does a manual (i.e. not periodic) full
sync once the L3 agent is ready (in 'after_start' method).

The change results in a much faster sync on a new agent.
With the patch it takes several seconds until routers are
created on the new/restarted L3 agent.

In Juno, I found I had quite a bit of detail under ""Proposed Change"". It
would have been useful to be able to subdivide those details into
sections. However, due to the way the template and unit tests were
structured, both first and second level sections were validated against
the expected structure.

This change adds a second-level section under Proposed Change called
Overview. The tests do not care about third-level subsections, so this
new section can be further broken up as necessary to keep the spec
readable.

Currently v3 endpoint commands access service.name directly, while
name is not a required attribute of service. So if we associate an
endpoint to a service without name, we will get an AttributeError
executing v3 endpoint commands later. This patch addresses this
issue by checking if service.name is available before accessing it.

When a shared network is created, it is stored
in arista_provisioned_nets under the tenant_id of
owner of the network. Later, when a different
tenant launches an instance on the shared network,
above mentioned DB is looked to find the network
under requesting tenant's ID, and it is not found,
and hence, the request is rejected.

The fix is made such that when a network is not
found under the requesting tenant's ID, check if
this network is shared network. If yes, then
check the DB to ensure that owner tenant exists
in the DB. If yes, then this is a valid request
and do not reject it. Otherwise reject it - as an
unknown tenant or network is specified in the

By removing synchronization locks from the LeftHand driver,
support for many simultaneous volume create/deletes and
volume attach/detachs will be added.  This is useful for high
availability environments where performance with locks in place
would be reduced.

Removing the locks requires the creation of a new LeftHand
client when a request is sent to the driver now.  This
allows requests to no longer be blocked if a request is
already in process by the driver.

This results in a performance increase for the driver and
better stability in a high availability environment.

Magnum client should not log any warning message if there is no logging
handler. Otherwise, magnum client will print a confusing message when
server return a failure status. Below is the exact message:

No handlers could be found for logger ""magnumclient.common.httpclient""

This message is just a warning that can be safely ignored. In particular,
this message does not indicate the root cause of the problem. Users
should find the root cause from other places (e.g. the server logs).

New version of oslo.i18n released and some things
moved around (internal private modules in the lib).

This should be fine and shouldn't matter to us, BUT
it seems we had some hackery going on in our unit tests
that were being lazy and importing and manipulating the
private library.

This patch removes those cases and fixed up the cinder.i18n
helper method for enable_lazy to accept a bool (which is how
the libraries method works to begin with).

Note that this is not a cherry-pick from master but as based
upon the commit below.  There were enough differences between
stable/juno and master that doing a cherry-pick didn't make sense.
This change, instead, is the smallest set of changes we can safely
do to handle the move to oslo i18n 1.3.0 or later.

In commit bc45c56f102cdef58840e02b609a89f5278e8cce, the live migration
RPC APIs were changed such that they intentionally wouldn't communicate
with older versions that don't provide the extra parameters that were
added. This breaks people using live migration to move workloads between
icehouse and juno compute nodes during an upgrade. It also generally
runs counter to our policies regarding RPC API compatibility.

The original bug only affected shared block storage users, which means
a large portion of users aren't even affected. Thus, this patch restores
compatibility with the older versions in all cases, but logs weighty
warning messages for the operators when a migration is performed that
looks to be affected by the bug. If we have enough information to
determine that the migration is not affected, we avoid the warning, but
otherwise err on the side of caution. If an operator is not actually
affected by the bug, they will see the warnings while the RPC API
version cap is in place (i.e. during the upgrade window) and then
the warnings will stop once it is removed.

UpgradeImpact: This will resolve upgrade issues from Icehouse->Juno
when using live migration.

DocImpact: Documenting the potential for data loss when migrating from
Icehouse to Juno when using live migration is something operators should
be aware of.

Currently there is no way to get all stack outputs in one query.
This prevents user scripts to be able to parse those values.

A workaround is to call `heat stack-show mystack` and to manually
extract outputs from the pretty table. Another way is to list output
keys with `heat output-list` then fetch each value separately using
`heat output-show`, which induces many queries.

This patch adds the ability to query all outputs in one command, in

The fake rpc driver's polling implementation doesn't understand
situations where there will never be another event, and instead polls
until the timeout in many cases (especially during test cleanup). For
functional tests this increases the run time of tests by over 50% due
to delays on the cleanup side.

This is slated to be addressed in the next oslo.messaging release, but
until we require > 1.5.1 this work around will dramatically speed up

Garbage volume remained when an attached NFS volume was migrated
to another NFS backend. An error message was generated as the
attached volume was not detached before being migrated. The root
cause of the issue is that status_update['status'] is only set
for retype and not for migration from one NFS backend to another
NFS backend. This patch proposes to fix the aforementioned issue
where migration fails from one NFS backend to another NFS backend.

If 'NaN' then the worker balance summary will fail with a TypeError.

0 makes sense in the common cases:

* either you have worker tags and they are numbered
* or you have no worker tags and thus you have just one worker, and
  we can call that worker '0' because it is the first one

Previously, every insert or delete into any policy resulted
in re-computation of that policy's dependency graph and
a check that no recursion occurred either within a policy
or across policies.  This dependency graph computation was
expensive because (i) instead of updating the graph based
on the policy statements inserted/deleted, the graph
was recomputed from scratch and (ii) each policy had
its own dependency graph, and to check for recursion
across policies we computed the union of those individual
graphs.  In addition, we were copying the list of current
rules before doing any of that computation.

This change eliminates all 3 sources of inefficiency.
There is now a single, global dependency graph; that graph
is updated incrementally on each insert/delete; there is
no copying of rules.  In addition, we ensure that the
dependency graph computation only happens for non-atoms
(since inserting atoms is a common case and atoms cannot
contribute to recursion).

The implementation adds a new graph data structure (BagGraph) that
makes the incremental computation of dependencies easy
and fast.  This change adds direct tests for the original Graph
data structure as well as for the new BagGraph.

Currently, ""is_slaac_subnet"" method only checks ""ipv6_address_mode"".
This will let neutron allocate a stateful IPv6 address for instance

unset. But actually, instance get IPv6 address prefix from radvd, and
auto configure IPv6 address by itself. This change will let ""is_slaac_

Glance SQL scripts assume too much about the environment and the way in
which they are executed by sqlalchemy-migrate. Particularly, they manage
transactions on their own even though sqlalchemy-migrate do it itself,
plus it assumes that scripts are executed in one go (even though
standard Python DB-API 2.0 does not mention multi-statement SQL commands
to be executed on DB cursors.

constant names, among which _DISK_RES_SUB_TYPE to
_DISK_DRIVE_RES_SUB_TYPE.

Because of a mistake when rebasing this patch
0e02db2980dc4e76ef7949ba4ec131af9fc4a44d, the old constant name
was still used in the vmutils.get_attached_disks method, causing
volume attachment to fail. This affects both v1 and v2 namespaces.

This patch fixes the incorrect constant name and adds the missing
unit test for this method.
