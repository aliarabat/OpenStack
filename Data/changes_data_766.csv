fail to connect to the ceph cluster prior to backup because the address

The last uses of the builtin os module are removed from generate
as the load_environment and load_user_configuration functions are
moved, along with the _extra_config method they rely upon. This
also moves the last use of the yaml module.

These functions are not refactored to make use of the other funcs
available in the filesystem package, and as a result there is
still an undesirable use of the dir_find func in the generate
script. These will all be cleaned up in a following patch to keep
this easier to review.

An unused left-over function is removed now that there are no
merge conflicts introduced by it.

A debug logging message is formatted consistent to other messages;
the only impact in this case is applying consistency in log
message formatting since the formatting was only occuring when the
log level is activated already.

longer a need to use repetitive statements. list_events already prunes
out rows based off user_id, project_id, audit_id and issued_at so we
can remove these subsequent statements in matches.
In order to test this, the _assertToken methods needed to call the
list_events method directly. The old implementation ignores
list_events and instead makes a list where it can ""add_event"" and
""remove_event"" which bypasses testing the actual changes made in
list_events since the tests assume list_events would have just sent
back the entire list anyway rather than what it does now which is
filter events based off the token

Since clients may not send messages to listeners that have a lower
rpc minor version, update listeners to listen on the ""next release""
rpc version number.

The general idea is to support rolling upgrades, which look like:

* Release O
  * all rpc api's support the future_args argument
  * Adding a new arg foo to an api entails: [1]
    * Pass foo in the future_args argument
    * Add foo with default argument to the api's signature
  * Listen on RPC_API_LISTEN_VERSION, send on (lower) RPC_API_VERSION
* Release P
  * Move all args added in prev release out of future args into their
    actual argument placeholder (e.g. foo).
  * As with prev release, new args added are passed along in
    future_args, placeholders with default arguments are added.
  * Bump RPC_API_LISTEN_VERSION by a comfortable margin over
    RPC_API_VERSION (e.g., minor version + 10).
...

With this architecture, heat-engine's could be upgraded on a rolling
basis (1-by-1). By contrast, the amqp vhost method requires
partitioning of the heat-engines into an inactive set and active set
and vhost manipulation. Release P would be the first release to
support this type of rolling upgrade (which wouldn't preclude the
vhost method to be used until then).

[1] This demonstrates the general pattern of adding an arg in the
API. However, since Release O wouldn't be backwards compatible with
Release N, we could actually just start sending foo in its actual
placeholder. Really, the pattern would have to be adopted starting
with P.

Add a config option ([conductor]/configdrive_max_db_size) to specify

For MySQL databases the configdrive is now stored in a MEDIUMTEXT
type, which has an upper limit of 16MiB. In a PostgreSQL database it
is still stored in a TEXT type which does not have a limit.

Fix for a bug 1599123. URL construction is now considering what is
defined as a hostname (IPv6 address or something else). The change
results in a url constructed as http?://IPv4_address:port/, or
http?://hostname:port/, or http?://[IPv6_address]:port/. There
should be no more malformed URLs like http://fd00::f00d:9191/
generated for IPv6 addresses.

It also includes a test in glance/tests/functional/test_images.py,
named TestImagesIPv6. Additional functions which work on IPv6 only
were added since the whole testing suite is hardcoded for IPv4.

Currently developers need to manually build a constratined venv if they
want to  match the versions that are tested in the gate.  This change
adds logic to run_tests.sh and install_venv*.py to default to the same
constraints file used in the gate.

With constraints enabled the 'churn' in the environment should be
minimised so remove the developer optimisation for detecting when
packaged versions change and always just install/update.  This has the
down side of making the script preamble slightly longer but we always
print_help() so I don't think it'll be terribly inconvenient.

This may not be the 'correct' (or even best) way to enable
Neutron in the gate, however there seem to be numerous issues
still remaining (mostly seeming to deal with IPv6 support).
Instead of trying to fix them all at once (a difficult
task as things are constantly moving) it is proposed that
we do the minimum possible (this) and then move towards
having a proper 'trove network' in a later changereq.

Note: This will be removed once we flip the gate to use
Neutron again.

PostgreSQL is very strict about types and won't perform an automatic

INSERT'ed or UPDATE'ed.

Coerce the value of deleted bound parameter to always be an integer
in the DB layer by adding a custom SQLAlchemy integer type decorator
to make PostgreSQL happy, should someone pass a boolean value for
deleted column (it was meant to be of boolean type, but is integer
instead to allow for Nova use case of shadow tables and compound
unique constraints on something + deleted).

This patch addresses several places where IPv6 and IPv6 link-local
addresses where not considered for communication between amphora and the
controller worker.

In the devstack plugin we permit both IPv4 and IPv6 for health
monitoring and the amphora REST API.

In the amphora's UDP health sender we parse the IP port string in a
manner which permits IPv6 addresses by splitting on the last colon
rather than every colon.

In the controller REST API driver we append an interface scope if using
IPv6 link-local addresses. This interface can be specified by an
operator is they are using an interface other than o-hm0, this only is
required if using IPv6 link-local addresses.

Occurs when a new file is stored to new suffix to not empty partition.
Then suffix is added to an invalidations file but not into hashes

suffix is completed on first and each 10th run of replicator. Rsync
runs on each new suffix because destination does not return hash of

This patch allows all loop devices to be scanned by LVM and this
fixes a bug that occurs after a reboot in AIOs when the loop device
numbering is shuffled. For example, the cinder loopback may be
mounted from /dev/loop4 when the AIO is first built, but it might
come up as /dev/loop0 when the AIO reboots.

The DB interface migration test laned as part of
Id7697de0276e9b2730ea62f9c562ed6e1d0f8a06 obtained
the list of expected interfaces after the migration
from the current state of the code.

This effectively blocks future interfaces from being
added as the later database migration to create the
interface will not yet have executed when the test
is executed.

As a result, the test has been updated to utilize
a static list of interfaces types, matching those
added as part of the database migration.

In https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/issues/3981
we see that Ansible having a default value for verify overrides the
value provided in clouds.yaml. That's not great. The solution
ansible-side is to set the default to None so that we can distinguish
between provided and not-provided. In doing so, we need to handle both
the None case and the case where the value is given as a string so that
the argument handling can still be done via passthrough.

This patch is deprecating the drac_host property in favor of
drac_address.

The drivers in the Ironic tree uses the ""<namespace>_address"" format for
setting the IP address to talk to their BMC except for Drac which used
""drac_host"" instead. This patch is fixing it.

These small incosistencies decrease the UX and make scripting around
Ironic harder than it should be.

When reading the OS-FEDERATION API documentation, it is not clear how
to find the ID of the token when requesting either an unscoped or
scoped token. Token requests for the OS-FEDERATION API work the same
way as for the standard API, which is that the token ID is returned in
the X-Subject-Token header, so let's just mention that in the
OS-FEDERATION API documentation.

changed to check if keytone_sp was ""{}"" rather than to check if it is
defined.

The horizon role still does a conditional to check if the var is
defined, rather than a check to see if it is ""{}"". This causes the
conditional to fail when the var is defaulted in user_variables, but has
no values in it.

Projects like Nova have been putting a lot of work into centralizing
and improving documentation of configuration options. One unfortunate
side effect of this change is the huge increase in the size of the
'nova.conf' configuration file, where, for every one line configuration
option there will be many lines of documentation.

Seeing as this documentation is already published using Sphinx, there
may be little reason to pollute the configuration file with this level
of detail. Add a configuration option that, when enabled, will ensure
only the the first paragraph (a summary) of each opt or group will be
output to the generated config file. The generated Sphinx documents
remain unchanged.

Proper version of this calculation is implemented upstream -
https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/151

And removed version of the code is actually harmful, as it's using
physicalprocessorcount (i.e. number of CPU sockets) for
calculations. So on a 2 CPU/48 thread system there it was 30 threads
instead of 768 calculated upstream.

I've decided that it's easier to completely remove this code instead
of duplicating current formula in upstream and providing a way to
override this value through hiera - just not worth a hassle.

With the TripleO promotion on Nov. 22, we no longer have any repos
on the overcloud-full image besides the CentOS base repos. This
meant when we tried to install python-tripleoclient in the script
that converts that image to an undercloud image it would fail.

This patch splits up the repo injection tasks from the image
update tasks, and puts the repo injection tasks before the image
conversion.

It also addresses an issue where just after TripleO promotion,
devmode is broken until the buildlogs repo mirror catches up. This
can be up to 2 hours. We fix it by allowing the install of tempest
and test packages to fail without failing the convert script. This
means in that 2 hour window where buildlogs is behind the image

better than not being able to boot an undercloud at all.

Finally, it splits out the image injection task, so that it is
always run when using an overcloud as an undercloud, and not
solely for the devmode use case.

In order to backport changes to Newton, mysql-python tests need
to pass, since it seems that tox.ini is still forcing MySQL
tests to use MySQL-Python (not pymysql or mysqlclient at least).
The change here re: libmysqlclient is impacting Newton, so backport.

Something changed in mysql-python / libmysqlclient or mysql and now
exceptions that used to be InternalError's have become OperationalError's.
Update filters accordingly to wrap those into oslo.db exceptions
properly.

OperationalError's are kind of special, as we re-raise them as is due
to historical reasons: we need to make sure that at least SAVEPOINT
errors are wrapped, as that's what oslo.db and neutron unit tests
expect.

Closes-Bug: #1630899
