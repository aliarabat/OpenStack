Various users (including Rackspace)  have existing internal usage systems that bill off of these events. (This is not so much a worry for Cinder, as we monitor usage differently there, there was mention of porting this change to Nova. That cannot be done as is, since it would break existing users. For Cinder, it wouldn\'t affect us (I cannot speak for other users of OS), but this would leave Cinder with a different model for usage notifications than Nova or other OS projects. )\nBasically, I\'m worried about non-backwards compatible changes to an integration point. \n\nTo get Cinder running, and solve ceiliometer\'s needs, perhaps we could change the event_type for these notifications (to volume.usage or similar?) to eliminate any confusion with the different nova .exists model? \n\nAlso, we need to have a configurable time period on these, every 60 seconds is too often.'}, {'account_id': 1669, 'date': '2012-11-06 09:43:16.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 4:\n\n@Monsyne\n\nI'm ok to leave the old audit code as it is.

A change was made in rpc that requires project's to define the
control_exchange option themselves.  This was so the project's could
set their own default value.  This change has made it in to nova without
adding the control_exchange option, meaning that it is using the default
of 'openstack', potentially conflicting with other projects.

bug 1081498

There are a few log messages without _(), but a lot messages with _().
Wrap these log messages with _() in order to make the code consistent.

fix missing imports for _

Pass the log message and interpolation argument(s) to the logger separately

remove extra parens

rework the patch against latest trunk

Change the type of flavor_id hidden field in EditFlavor form
from IntegerField to CharField since flavor id is a string
representation of UUID now. Additionally change the type of
similar hidden fields in CreateExtraSpec and EditExtraSpec forms.

Remove flavor id generation from form handling code. Id generation

Since nova supports flavor id autogeneration and 'flavorid' parameter
of FlavorManager.create() in novaclient is optional, remove 'flavorid'

Change flavor ids in test data from strings containing integers
to UUID-like strings to make them correspond to real data.

Update flavor tests to make them compatible with new
api.nova.flavor_create() signature.

Remove conversions of flavor id to int from all tests. In particular,
update test_index_flavor_get_exception() to make it generate unique
UUID flavor ids instead of integers.

Configure all dnsmasq instances to use the hosts file instead of the
default local file '/etc/host' when the network is configured in
'multi_host' mode.

This hosts file contains all DNS entries of the network and it is
replicated on all host where a 'nova-network' daemon is instantiated.
There is a hosts file for each networks.

It needs to add a new network API to update the host file on all
network hosts.

Fixes bug 1081808

The start_guests_on_host_boot config option ignores any/all
user-requested VM state and attempts to start every VM assigned to the
hypervisor in question. This means even a VM which was suspended,
paused, in error state, etc will run through the process of attempting
to start. resume_guests_state_on_host_boot provides similar
functionality, except that it confirms the VM was previously in a
running state prior to attempting to restart on compute startup.

This patch will remove the config option entirely.

instance_get_all_by_host()

It also makes the compute/manager use nova-conductor for those operations.

When converting an Aggregate sqlalchemy model to primitive types using
jsonutils.to_primitive(), the hosts and metadata were being left out.
This is because they are implemented as properties on the model and must
be explicitly listed as extra keys to be read.

We also want to make sure that the _hosts and _metadata are eager
loaded.  This patch ensures this gets done by adding it to the
_get_aggregate_query() helper, and making sure it is used everywhere
that is appropriate.  Also, on creation of the aggregate, just manually
set _hosts and _metadata to empty lists, since we know they're empty at
this point.

These changes caused a side effect to the os-aggreages API extension.
The result from creating an aggregate started including 'hosts' and
'metadata'.  There's a hack in there to maintain the same API result.
These don't add any value to this API call anyway, since we know they're
blank at this point.

When the vm tries to renew its lease it will send a packet to the old mac and fail, but it will re-arp after it doesn't receive a response.\n\nAnother potential option would be to arping for the address after a migration so hopefully the vm can update its arp tables, but I think either this or the ebtables mangling are optimisations that can be done later if the re-arp turns out to cause hiccups / delays.\n\nNote that in my configuration I am using this with handing out a hardware gateway instead of using the local compute host as the gateway so the potential hiccups are limited to the dhcp renew.

This adds a new flag: share_dhcp_address which if enabled in
multihost mode will allow all compute nodes to share an ip on
guest network. The code will isolate the address using iptables
and ebtables so it is only visible to the vms.

This patch has two benefits:

a) we don't have to use an ip address from every network for each
compute node. This is especially valuable in vlan mode where the
networks are generally small

b) we can improve security by blocking all access to the ip on the
guest network from outside the compute node. While we could do similar
blocking using a different ip for each node, it makes dhcp setup
much more complicated if a vm is migrated to another node.

Adding in a read() to the ResponseIndexable solves
this and also later problems where the response is
read() from.

The patch set enables the following:
1. Bridges to be created by Nova
2. Bridges to be created by the agent

The code is backward compatible, that is, if Nova does not create the brdige
then the agent will create the bridge.

In addition to this it cleans gateway code no longer used.

The patch enables the following Nova code to be backported:

nova-dhcpbridge can read in an alternate config file location but wasn't
using it to parse config options.  This fixes a regression introduced in
00786bc554a2dfacb3c6f02fbb7e9c98f35d4262.

This change is motivated by the fact that nova-dhcpbridge is passed to
dnsmasq in restart_dhcp() in nova/network/linux_net.py, and there is
currently no support for overriding config options for nova-dhcpbridge
in that call.  There is support for overriding the FLAGFILE env variable

During Ubuntu builds we run the run_test.sh script
during the package build process, so that we can catch
regressions in our packaging before uploading to the archive.

However a recent change writes the output of the nosetests
to an error log so we don't see why the package fail to build.

This patch also displays the output of the nosetests so we
can see why the tests fail without having to look at the nosetests.log.

This patch add the '-v', for a verbose display of nosetests.

Updates the rxtx_factor validations in the instance_types modules so
that rxtx_factor is validated as a float. Given that rxtx_factor is stored
as a float in the database this makes sense... and also adheres
to some of the extension documentation as well (although some of
the extension docs were incorrect as well).

Previously rxtx_factor was being cast into an int which caused it to
be stored and displayed incorrectly via the API.

This patchset adds a test which fails with the old code.

Additionally some of the API docs are corrected so that rxtx_factor is
listed as a float in all examples.

Fixes LP Bug #1081287.

The Nova Glance wrapper returns all images metadata
if the parameter 'limit' is not define. It doesn't
split the image metadata list.

So the sub method fetch_image is no more needed.
We can delete it.

I added a check in Nova Glance wrapper to be sure
the parameter 'marker' or another one aren't set
to 'None' (like in bug #1065053).

Fixes LP bug #1070904

The XML serializer for create uses the server template for it's response.
However, when return_reservation_id is set, only a reservation_id is
going to be returned.

To enable the XML response to be serialized the reservation id is now
returned in a server tag/object.

The libvirt.xml file is written on initial boot of the instance and
may not reflect the current state of the vm if volumes have been
attached. If the libvirt definition of the vm has been lost, it is
safer to regenerate it rather than attempt to load it from the

Change ID I3e2973 broke XenAPI migrations (resizes) as it caused snapshots
of all disks (including swap and ephemeral disks, if enabled) to be sent
over to the destination host.  The destination only expects vhds for the
root disk, named by sequence numbers.  swap and ephemeral disks ended up
with sequence numbers, also, messing up the re-building of the chain on
the destination.

Change ID I3e2973 also didn't change the stub of VM.snapshot to
VDI.snapshot, but tests still passed due to the new code ignoring all
exceptions while snapshotting.  Potential issues in
snapshot_attached_here() would also be ignored due to excessive stubbing
in the xenapi migration testing.  This is also addressed here.

nova-dhcpbridge's FLAGFILE environment variable is one of the few
remaining references we have to ""flags"".

Switching to use a new environment variable is easy, but we need
to take care that when you upgrade the code the compute and network
services might not be restarted immediately.

If this happens, the services may launch a new dnsmasq (so rootwrap
needs to continue to support FLAGFILE) or an existing dnsmasq might run
the lease script (so the script needs to support FLAGFILE).

During quota check we used to simply retrieve the entire collection
of resources from the database, then counting them in Python. This
patch introduces a specialized _get_collection_count() method, which
instead take advantage of the DB's built-in count capabilities.

In order to take advantage of this, plugins can now implement

When you attach a volume to a running instance, only the running
xml is updated in libvirt. This is due to the usage of the
VIRT_DOMAIN_AFFECT_CURRENT flag passed to attach device. What we
really want is to affect both the config and the running xml. There
is no combination of flags that works in all states, so we explicitly
set the right combination of flags depending on the running state
of the vm.

Includes a test to test_virt_drivers to ensure the flags are passed
correctly.

When an instance starts, compute ask the resource manager to check the
compute capabilities. If the compute resources are sufficient, the
resource manager updates the 'host' instance field in the database. But
the local variable 'instance' use by compute manger isn't updated.
So, when compute manager asks the network manager to allocate a network
for the instance, the 'host' instance field is null.

Some compute tests doesn't update the local variable instance when
they change some parameter on instance and failed with this patch.

It's far less complicated than the virt driver, so everything in a simple flat directory seems acceptable. \n\nThanks much for the comments!""}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-08-11 16:38:06.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7: Works for me\n\nBuild successful\n\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-merge/6974/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-docs/2790/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-pep8/8102/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-python26/4260/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-python27/4312/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-tempest-devstack-vm/7481/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n'}, {'account_id': 159, 'date': '2012-08-14 20:14:42.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve\n\nA lot of stuff here, but I think it is looking good!'}, {'account_id': 1711, 'date': '2012-08-22 20:59:42.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7: Work In Progress\n\nDeferred to G release.'}, {'account_id': 9, 'date': '2012-09-06 06:03:01.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7:\n\ncode review expired after 2 weeks of no activity, it can be restored using the `Restore Change` button under the Patch Set on the web interface'}, {'account_id': 9, 'date': '2012-09-06 06:03:01.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7: Abandoned\n\ncode review expired after 2 weeks of no activity, it can be restored using the `Restore Change` button under the Patch Set on the web interface'}, {'account_id': 5319, 'date': '2012-09-11 02:46:40.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 7: (1 inline comment)\n\nNice patch, its exactly what I was looking for.

Summary:
* provide a pluggable ServiceGroup monitoring API
* refactor the old DB-based implementation to the new API

Currently nova compute nodes periodically write to the database (every
10 seconds by default) to report their liveness.  This implementation
factors out this functionality and make it a set of abstract internal
APIs with a pluggable backend implementation.  Currently it's named as
ServiceGroup APIs.

With this effort, we are hopeful to see the following benefits:

 * We expect to see more backend implementations in addition to the
default database-based one, such as ZooKeeper (as described in
blueprint zk-service-heartbeat) or rabbitmq heartbeat based.

 * We expect the code to live in openstack-common so projects other
than Nova can take advantage of the internal APIs.

 * Lay the foundations to use lower overhead heartbeat mechanisms
which scale better.

 * Other than reporting whether a node in a service group is up or
down, the code may also be used to query for members.  Other parts of
the code could also take advantage of the new APIs. One noteable
example is the MatchMaker in the rpc library, which may even become
redundant. We have been working with Eric at Cloudscaling to see how
this fits with the matchmaker. It is likely that this code will need
to be used, at least by the peer-to-peer based RPC mechanisms, to
implement the new create_worker method.

Updates dns_driver.DNSDriver so that we raise NotImplementedError
instead of returning empty result sets or passing. Since this
class is the default dns_driver for Nova it can be quite
confusing when it returns empty results (which actually
causes some HTTP 500 errors as well).

Also updates several test suites to use MiniDNS instead
(which is meant for testing) including some additional
cleanup to remove the dnstest.txt file.

Ported code originally from Dan Prince
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/11815/

Fix slight style issue. Add a log.warn in addition to
throwing an exception in minidns. Add an ignore of the
said exception in manager.

Looks like we need to add tempfile to get past smoke
tests!!

This adds the use of eventlet's db_pool module so that we can make mysql
calls without blocking the whole process.

New config options are introduced:

sql_dbpool_enable -- Enables the use of eventlet's db_pool
sql_min_pool_size -- Set the minimum number of SQL connections

The default for sql_dbpool_enable is False for now, so there is
no forced behavior changes for those using mysql.  sql_min_pool_size
is defaulted to 1 to match behavior if not using db_pool.

Adds a new test module for our sqlalchemy code, testing this new option
as much as is possible without requiring mysql server to be running.

Nova endpoint in keystone was registered if n-cpu is enabled. However it is
a usual case where n-cpu runs on a different host in multi-node setup and
it results in no endpoint for nova. n-api is a better condition since nova-api

Currently when list servers from all tenants (i.e. --all-tenants is set as 1
when ""nova list""), privilege is required.

However, computer pollster in ceilometer need to get all instances from
all tenants in one host. Granting admin privilege to the pollster is
not very secure.

All tenants servers list should be policy-based, instead of requiring
admin privelege.

There is one potential backward compatibility. With all_tenants specified,
non-admin accounts will get back owned servers only without this patch,
however it will get policy exception now if policy checking failed. IMHO
the new behaviour makes more sense.

Instead of calling trigger_security_group_members_refresh,
have NetworkManager and derived classes call more specific
methods when an instance is created or destroyed.

Methods such as the trigger_instance_add_security_group_refresh
and trigger_instance_remove_security_group_refresh,
instead of just having trigger_security_group_members_refresh
get called and forcing implementors to try and figure out if
it's an add or delete

Fixes bug 1052696.

Update the compute manager to pass network_info and block_device_info
to the driver.resume() and update all virtualization drivers to accept
the new arguments.

For libvirt, change resume() to use _create_domain_and_network()
rather than _create_domain(). This eliminates the assumption that the
network and block device connections remained in place from the period
between the VM being suspended and resumed.  Instead, all the
networking and block connections will be rebuilt on resume (in case
they are missing) as is the case after a hypervisor reboot.

When an instance starts, compute ask the resource manager to check the
compute capabilities. If the compute resources are sufficient, the
resource manager updates the 'host' instance field in the database. But
the local variable 'instance' use by compute manger isn't updated.
So, when compute manager asks the network manager to allocate a network
for the instance, the 'host' instance field is null.

Some compute tests doesn't update the local variable instance when
they change some parameter on instance and failed with this patch.

When an instance starts, compute ask the resource manager to check the
compute capabilities. If the compute resources are sufficient, the
resource manager updates the 'host' instance field in the database. But
the local variable 'instance' use by compute manger isn't updated.
So, when compute manager asks the network manager to allocate a network
for the instance, the 'host' instance field is null.

Some compute tests doesn't update the local variable instance when
they change some parameter on instance and failed with this patch.
