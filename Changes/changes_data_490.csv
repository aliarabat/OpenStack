This patch adds a periodic healing mechanism into the monitor module and
monitoring plugins. With this change, the heal_reservations() method of
resource plugin was changed to receive a period (start/end_date
arguments) to heal.

This change is for not healing (reallocating) all of reservations for
failed resources immediately because failed resources are expected to
recover sometime in the future. The monitor tries to heal only
reservations which are active or will start soon. Remaining reservations
are expected to be healed by the periodic healing.

Create a tox environment for running the unit tests against the lower
bounds of the dependencies.

Create a lower-constraints.txt to be used to enforce the lower bounds
in those tests.

python-blazarclient 1.0.0 is not available on PyPI,
so the minimum version is bumped to 1.0.1.

Also, I assume you meant ""force=True"". If you evacuate with a target host but force=False, we validate the requested target host in the scheduler and make a claim on that host since it\'s a move operation. If you specify force=True, then we bypass the scheduler, however, we still create allocations on the forced dest host:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/7f6fbe0e198114a874a0695e007f1672758b3d65/nova/conductor/manager.py#L832'}, {'account_id': 6873, 'date': '2018-04-20 18:38:27.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 4:\n\nFurthermore, regarding evacuate with a forced host, yes we claim the resources on the dest host:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/7f6fbe0e198114a874a0695e007f1672758b3d65/nova/conductor/manager.py#L832\n\nBut that doesn't do any trait filtering which GET /allocation_candidates would normally do.

Rebuild should fail since new allocation needs to be made against SRIOV_VF:2 as the requirement for traits=HW_NIC_OFFLOAD_XX forces us to select that resource.\n\nProposed solution - reject request in case traits have changed from original image\nResult: Fail to launch since image1 and image2 traits do not match.\n\nAlternative #1 - Use GET /resource_providers/{rp_uuid}/traits\nResult: Successful launch.

This adds a functional test which runs two cells, one host per
cell, and attempts to cold migrate an instance from the host
in one cell to the host in the other cell, which fails in the
API with ComputeHostNotFound because the context is targeted
to the cell where the instance lives, so it won't be able to
find the targeted host in the other cell.

Sometimes, the output is REALLY big. It ends up throwing an error in
MySQL trying to write to the output of the ActionExecution to the
database. Since we're passing the output back via zaqar, we can
just throw this away.

The trash_output flag defaults to false, to maintain the original
behavior.

Python 3.2 added the 'style' parameter to 'logging.Formatter.__init__'.
This is provided by 'logging.config.fileConfig' meaning this currently
raises a 'TypeError' similar to the below when the incompatible
formatters, JSONFormatter and FluentFormatter, are used with Python 3.2

Resolve this by simply adding the parameter to the list. There is more
work we can do here (like actually supporting this parameter) but that's
a job for another patch.

Note that we can't actually test this as doing so would involve invoking
'logging.config.fileConfig', which in turn would modify the global state
of the 'logging' module. You can thank the singleton pattern for that.

This patch removes all the tasks being executed
inside the playbook used for running overcloud
updates. Most of these removed tasks are being
handled somewhere else (import triploe-upgrade [0],
mainly) so we can simplify the playbook by calling
the tripleo-upgrade role with the required
parameters defined in each fs.

This patch also gets rid of container_registry_file,
which is being moved into the job's fs in [1].

The neutron agents use subprocesses like dnsmasq and keepalived as part
of their implementation. Running these ""subprocesses"" in separate
containers prevent dataplane breakages/unnecessary failover on agent
container restart.

Also amends docker daemon options to allow including additional unix
domain sockets to bind to the docker daemon. The paths can be mounted by
containers that launch containers instead of mounting /run/docker.sock.
This avoids issues if the docker daemon is restarted while the containers
are running.

Backends such as OVN will create a port to be used by the metadata agent
upon creating a network. That port will be substract from the tenant's
quota and that was what was previsouly causing this test to fail in OVN.

This patch is changing the approach to make it more generic by calculating

is created and prior to the new port being created.

LocalContainerRegistry is a new parameter that is set to local_ip by
default. It'll be used in TripleO Heat Templates when deploying a local
container registry, to bind the service on this address.

Before, it was done in instack-undercloud and automatically binded on
local-ip. Now, it'll be a parameter and still defaulted to the local-ip
used on the undercloud.

It's part of the efforts to containerize the undercloud and deploy
Docker with Ansible.

Change I0c4ca6a81f213277fe7219cb905a805712f81e36 added more error
handling to the _ensure_resource_provider flow but didn't account
for @safe_connect returning None when calling _create_resource_provider
in the case that nova-compute is started before placement is running.
If that happens, we fail with a TypeError during the nova-compute
startup because we put None in the resource provider cache and then
later blindly try to use it because the compute node resource provider
uuid is in the cache, but mapped to None.

This adds the None check back in _ensure_resource_provider and if
None is returned from _create_resource_provider we raise the same
exception that _create_resource_provider would raise if it couldn't
create the provider.

Cinder backends should not repeat the step_config that the CinderVolume
service uses to trigger things in puppet-tripleo. This is benign when
Cinder runs on baremetal, but causes problems when Cinder runs in
containers. It causes the cinder-volume service to run twice, in both
the container as well as on the baremetal host.

This helps generating subnet masks by checking for
subnet masks already used from the same test class.

This also avoids having to check if a subnet with
conflicting subnet CIDR already exists treating
subnet error creation by looking in a local set
of already reserved CIDRs.

It fixes a problem that makes create_subnet
try to reuse the same CIDRs more than once
producing test failures.

It also allows methods to blank list some CIDRs
to avoid create_subnet from using it an therefore
avoid interferences.

It is not robust to upload a special package in a common method.
However, because of change from Hadoop(2.8.2 and later)side,
we do need the dependency package ""commons-httpclient"" in
oozie/sharelib to let oozie work.
This patch removes the uploading step in sahara because there is
a patch 2eedcec728b4f93e4cb226c5137159dcb3ddbfa3 which add
""commons-httpclient"" as a dependency to oozie/sharelib.
So when we build the oozie binary package, ""commons-httpclient""
will be as a part of it.

The idea was that you could access every message for a workflow, regardless of the execution id - what if you don\'t know the execution id?\n\nI don\'t want to keep all three locations for the message in swift - hopefully jtomasek can tell us which is most useful and what we should keep/change.\n\n \n > Finally I think the ""latest"" link/copy needs to live at the\n > top-level, as with this you still need to find it amongst possibly\n > several worklfows in the container, and we won\'t clean old ""latest""\n > so we\'ll end up with duplicates?\n\nI moved it to the type top level. So it will be the latest per-workflow, I think that might be the most useful place. Otherwise you will get a general latest message but it will be unclear what for - until you download it and see the type? I assume if you want to get the latest message then you know which workflow you care about.\n\n > \n > I did wonder if we can use swift symlinks instead of a copy for\n > this:\n > \n > https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/simulate-symLinks-on-cloud-files/\n\nGood idea!

impression that getting a ""latest"" message from a predictable location in this container would amount to the same as what you are asking for, but perhaps I\'m missing something?\n\nThe disadvantage of inventing a new abstraction vs messages is we have to update every workflow to write the plan deploy status and still send messages - this abstraction combines them both, with the idea that it would be *more* performant and less impactful on the various workflows (although I do understand we\'ll need to start sending an in-progress message that will also be persisted to swift to derive that

When the evacuation of a nova-compute is in progress on a compute node,
starting the nova-compute service on that node would cause a race in
setting task_state [1] and could ultimately lead failures with all
future evacuation attempts on the compute node.

To avoid triggering that situation, introduce a startup wrapper when
Instance HA is enabled. The wrapper loops until the force-down flag is
clear and all evacuation finished, and then starts nova_compute.

When running a multi-node ELK stack (5+ nodes) the elasticsearch server
needs to be able to mark and identify nodes that will be data and master
nodes. This change ensures that the first set of available master nodes
is mark accordingly as both data and master and that all other nodes are
marked as cluster members with alternating nodes being marked as data
nodes. With this change the cluster will be able to grow as well as
handle large data sets more efficiently.

This change ensures that sharding is correctly started when the cluster
is deployed and that the beat services are using the recommended
sharding practices.

Now we can use the ConsoleAuthToken object to do token

the ConsoleAuthToken object for token validation.

Tha ConsoleAuthToken object is prepared to work with cells
v2. We use consoleauth if using cells v1.

A new config option: [workarounds]/enable_consoleauth has been
added to aid in transitioning to the database backend if
resetting already existing consoles would be problematic for an
operator.

Along with converting to the database backend for console token auth,
the console proxies need to run per cell instead of globally. This way,
the instance UUID isn't needed in the access url as users will be
handed an access url local to the cell their instances is in. With
console proxies sharded across cells, a large cloud will no longer have
a bottleneck of one console proxy for the entire deployment.

This also disables the novnc tempest tests with a TODO to re-enable
them once the nova patch series that converts from the nova-consoleauth
backend -> cell database backend lands.

Use a lock to deal with the following scenarios:

1. The _misplaced_objects handler in process A is removing misplaced
object rows from db while an rsync_then_merge in process B
concurrently attempts to relink the db file, potentially causing
misplaced row ranges to be removed from a different db from which they
were moved.

Now, _misplaced_objects will contend for a lock with rsync_then_merge,
and once lock is acquired will confirm the db id is that from which
rows were moved.

2. An rsync_then_merge in process A re-links retiring db concurrently
with a _complete_sharding in process B unlinking the retiring db
(requires the rsync_then_merge to have been in progress since before
sharding began).

Now, rsync_then_merge will contend for lock with _complete_sharding
and check the old db file still exists before renaming its new db
file.

3. usync merge in process A writes rows to retiring db concurrently
with a _complete_sharding in process B unlinking the retiring db
(requires the usync to have been in progress since before sharding
began).

Now, usync will contend for lock with _complete_sharding and check the
old db file still exists before returning success.

This patch also catches sqlite3 exceptions raised if a db file is
unlinked while a usync (or rsync_then_merge) is attempting write (or
read) the db. An HTTPFound will now be returned in response to the
REPLICATE request if this happens.

This patch ensures that we don't install any packages outside of a
virtualenv with pip.

CentOS has issues with python modules which are installed with pip

The capabilities filter gets incorrectly blamed for a lot of
deployment failures because on a retry of a node deployment the
filter has to fail because there is only one node that can match
when using predictable placement.  However, we don't have any

This reverts commit f2affa0e64f6666672000e12f005609a67753860 and
also adds the stack update to the minor update and ffwd-upgrade
converge.

A new workflow parameter run_heat_stack_update is added for each
of updates/upgrade/ffwd_upgrade converge so that the heat stack
update is run only conditionally.

Feel free to modify your patch\n    and resubmit a new change-set.\n\n    Patches usually take 3 to 7 days to be reviewed so be patient and be\n    available on IRC to ask and answer questions about your work. Also it\n    takes generally at least a couple of weeks for cores to get around to\n    reviewing code. The more you participate in the community the more\n    rewarding it is for you. You may also notice that the more you get to know\n    people and get to be known, the faster your patches will be reviewed and\n    eventually approved.

I would be honored to serve as chair for the TC for this session.

With Thierry stepping down as chair, this session will be the first
time the TC as it stands today is chaired by someone from outside of
the Foundation staff. This is an important step for us, to show not
only that our principle of Changes in Leadership are Good applies to
the TC, but that our leaders can and will place the needs of the
community first. Over the 6 years I have been contributing to
OpenStack and the 4+ years I have served on the TC, I have been
employed by 3 separate companies. I hope my history of service within
the community reassures everyone of my continued impartiality.

The nature of the TC and the issues it has had to address have changed
in significant ways several times while I have been involved.

When the TC addressed fundamental questions about what types of
projects should be included in the community, and OpenStack expanded
from a simple IaaS project to our current mission of producing the
ubiquitous Open Source Cloud Computing platform, I helped navigate
that change, first as a member of the Ceilometer team (one of the
first teams to be added to OpenStack without being spawned from an
existing project), and later as a TC member drafting early versions of
the Big Tent resolution.

When our community went through a period of intensive growth, as
companies joined and brought new features and formed new projects, I
helped organize the Oslo and release teams to cope with that growth by
implementing the liaison system and driving more use of automation.

More recently, as we have seen some leveling off, or even reduction,
of contributors, I worked with the documentation and requirements
teams to accommodate the contraction by shifting documentation from a
central location into team-owned repositories and by simplifying the
way we manage dependency settings in each project. These changes
reduced the friction for contributors to those projects.

Those experiences have prepared me to help us through this next
transition, as well.

My goals for this session are to have a smooth transition and to help
the TC work together as a team to achieve our shared objectives. I
have a few things I would like to change about the way we organize
ourselves based on patterns we have seen work well elsewhere,
including using sub-teams of TC members to manage our recurring
responsibilities more actively.

I look forward to talking with you about the future of the TC over the
next few weeks.

Until the context middleware has been processed, logs from any other
middleware will be logged with the request ID of the *previous* request.
Currently this is most logs in the API log files, which makes the request
ID worse than useless for determining what is going on.

To ensure all logs get the correct request ID, move the context middleware
close to the front of the pipeline, right after the request_id middleware
that generates the request ID and the auth middleware (the data from which
is needed to populate the context). Also, explicitly include the request_id
middleware in the cfn-compatibility APIs' pipelines.

Unfortunately, any failures in the auth middleware will still be logged
with the wrong request ID. This appears to be unavoidable, since we can't
create the context until after we have authenticated the request.

Change I0c4ca6a81f213277fe7219cb905a805712f81e36 added more error
handling to the _ensure_resource_provider flow but didn't account
for @safe_connect returning None when calling _create_resource_provider
in the case that nova-compute is started before placement is running.
If that happens, we fail with a TypeError during the nova-compute
startup because we put None in the resource provider cache and then
later blindly try to use it because the compute node resource provider
uuid is in the cache, but mapped to None.

This adds the None check back in _ensure_resource_provider and if
None is returned from _create_resource_provider we raise the same
exception that _create_resource_provider would raise if it couldn't
create the provider.

Replace strategy of time.sleep(s_value) waiting for an image to
reach 'active' with a time-bounded wait-for-status loop function.
That way we can have a more generous s_value, which seems to
sometimes be needed in the gates, without having to use that much
time on every run.

I picked the initial s_value as 4x what was in the current code,
though given that some of the other gate tests run >1 hour, we could
easily make it 600 sec without lengthening the current minimum
time-to-verification of a patch.

Adds a new placement API microversion that supports specifying multiple
member_of parameters to the GET /resource_providers and GET
/allocation_candidates API endpoints.

When multiple member_of parameters are found, they are passed down to
the ResourceProviderList.get_by_filters() method as a list. Items in
this list are lists of aggregate UUIDs.

The list of member_of items is evaluated so that resource providers
matching ALL of the member_of constraints are returned.

When a member_of item contains multiple UUIDs, we look up resource
providers that have *any* of those aggregate UUIDs associated with them.

This patch is a squash of three other patch that are needed to have a
successful stable job run:

1. Fix pep8 errors

Recent pep8 upgrade and corresponding pycodestyle update break pep8 job
due to the new rules. This commit fixes the following new errors:

  - E711 comparison to None should be 'if cond is None:'
  - E402 module level import not at top of file
  - W503 line break before binary operator

(original Change-Id: I59b6682e6295ab77efc25c275b8a2b70923433db)

2. Fix six.moves imports

pep8 job fails due to relative import issue at six.moves imports:
* Relative import 'six.moves.urllib', should be 'six.moves'
* Relative import 'six.moves.urllib.parse', should be 'six.moves'

3. sphinx-docs job for stable branch

build-openstack-sphinx-docs jobs fail on stable branches due to the new
pip version 10 introduces some previously Warning as Error: in case of
calling ""pip install"" without any package name, the command fails.
tox_install.sh is called during docs job without any package passed to pip.

Update the tripleo.derive_params.v1.derived_parameters workflow to use
scheduler hints associated with a given role. The scheduler hints are
used to identify overcloud nodes associated with the role, and take
precedence over nodes identified by their profile/flavor. If a role does
not specify any scheduler hints then the workflow falls back to matching
nodes by profile/flavor.

Add a tripleo.baremetal.v1.nodes_with_node_id workflow that searches
for ironic nodes matching a node placement regex. This workflow is
analogous to the existing nodes_with_profile workflow that searches
for nodes that match a given profile.

Add a tripleo.baremetal.get_node_id Mistral action that returns the node
placement ID (e.g. ""controller-0"") for a given node, or None if a node
ID is not defined. This is analogous to the existing get_profile action
that returns the profile assigned to the node.

Fix the 'message' published when a derived parameter sub-workflow fails
so it just returns the sub-workflow 'message' and not the entire sub-
workflow result. The 'message' portion is the only part that is meaningful
to the user.

Individual request groups (numbered or un-numbered) in a granular
resource request may be satisfied by a sharing provider.  In such cases,
we will need to be able to figure out which non-sharing trees the
sharing provider can be associated with.

This change introduces a helper method, _anchors_for_sharing_provider,
that accepts the ID of a sharing provider and returns the UUIDs of all
the unique root providers of trees associated with the same aggregate as
the sharing provider.

The sharing provider may or may not itself be part of a tree; in either
case, its root provider UUID is included in the result.

If the sharing provider is not part of any aggregate, the empty list is
returned.

When deploying Ceph with tripleo/ceph-ansible a user may
override the ansible-playbook call environment varialbes by
using the CephAnsibleEnvironmentVariables parameter. However,
this only affects the ceph-ansible playbook run, and not the
the playbook run which collects UUIDs from nodes. This change
merges the those same overrides into the collect UUID task.

Also uses the same CephAnsiblePlaybookVerbosity parameter.

The point about requirements should be covered now that we have lower-requirements.txt, even if we may do intermediate releases if we introduce a new feature in the plugins API which is needed by the plugins. \n\nAbout the other point and Image packing, I totally missed the section.

When we introduced `cpu_model_extra_flags` config attribute (in
commit: 6b601b7 -- ""libvirt: Allow to specify granular CPU feature
flags""), we said it was case-insensitive; but unfortunately I missed to
_really_ make it so (despite proposing code for it in one of the
revisions).

Address that mistake by making `cpu_model_extra_flags` case-insensitive
for real, from Nova's point of view.

NB: Internally, this patch is normalizing 'extra_flags' to _lower_
casing -- because CPU flags _must_ be lower case from libvirt's point of
view.  Nova must honour that; otherwise, launching instances with an
upper case CPU flag, 'FOO', will fail with: ""libvirtError: internal
error: Unknown CPU feature FOO"".

As we discovered bug #1768586 we'll need to make sure that every
parameter tweak in plan is followed by a stack update.

So far the Ceph upgrade command did set param -> stack update -> unset
param (only in plan). However this means the last CephAnsiblePlaybook
setting (back to normal deploy playbook) was discarded.

We could make Ceph upgrade command do one more stack update to make
the parameter take effect, but it is better to just not do any
""converge"" in the Ceph command and rely on the update/upgrade/ffwd
converges to set the correct CephAnsiblePlaybook. This means that we
won't do more stack updates than necessary, and at the same time the
user workflow stays somewhat consistent between envs that do and don't
have Ceph.

An alternative would be to run the as part of the Ceph command, but
that either means we'd have to run one more stack update then
necessary, or skip the last converge in envs with Ceph, and
essentially diverge further from the non-Ceph workflow.

On ONTAP NFS driver, the export path was being used as the volume
name. If the export path is different than the volume name, the
API call to delete files would fail and the driver would invoke
a fallback method that deletes the files manually. This patch fixes
that by finding the correct volume name.

The ironic virt driver maintains a cache of ironic nodes to avoid
continually polling the ironic API.  Code paths requiring a specific
node use a limited set of fields, _NODE_FIELDS, when querying the
ironic API for the node. This reduces the memory footprint required by
the cache, and the network traffic required to populate it. However,
in most cases the cache is populated using a detailed node list
operation in _refresh_cache(), which includes all node fields.

This change specifies _NODE_FIELDS in the node list operation in
_refresh_cache().

We also modify the unit tests to use fake node objects that are
representative of the nodes in the cache.

This change adds two tempest integration tests for the resource
classes reporting in nova. These tests create fake nodes with
minimal compute resources and random resource classes and check
that the corresponding inventories are reported in the placement
API. We also include a minimal version of the placement API
client, as there is no plan at the moment to have a generic one
in tempest.

Rawgit unfortunately doesn\'t have a breadcrumbs section to show all options and does make it look like it always requires a header of some sort, but check out the design page here: http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/navigation/breadcrumbs/#design\n\nWhen we designed the breadcrumb we knew that there would be cases where the page title should be optional in the case of saving vertical space. Scrolling down you will see this option in the design even though there isn\'t a specific full page of code to show this option.\n\n > \n > I like the idea of saving vertical space by removing the header.\n > Although it makes plan page inconsistent with other high level\n > pages we have (Nodes, Plans).

I think PatternFly could do a much better job with keeping rawgit inline with what we are recommending from a design point of view on the PatternFly site. It\'s a great tool for testing, but really not meant to be the final word :( What do you think about removing the ""Nodes"" page header too and simply relying on the Tab name to label the page?

This patch removes the h1 plan name at the top of the deployment
plan details page. Since the plan name has been included in
the breadcrumb, this large page title isn't needed. Removing it
will save precious vertical space and align with PatternFly
standards.

When we introduced `cpu_model_extra_flags` config attribute (in
commit: 6b601b7 -- ""libvirt: Allow to specify granular CPU feature
flags""), we said it was case-insensitive; but unfortunately I missed to
_really_ make it so (despite proposing code for it in one of the
revisions).

Address that mistake by making `cpu_model_extra_flags` case-insensitive
for real, from Nova's point of view.

NB: Internally, this patch is normalizing 'extra_flags' to _lower_
casing -- because CPU flags _must_ be lower case from libvirt's point of
view.  Nova must honour that; otherwise, launching instances with an
upper case CPU flag, 'FOO', will fail with: ""libvirtError: internal

When updating a resource that hasn't changed, we didn't previously retry
the write when the atomic_key of the resource didn't match what we expect.
In addition to locking a resource to update it, the atomic key is also
incremented when modifying metadata and storing cached attribute values.
Apparently there is some mechanism that can cause this to happen in the
time between when the resource is loaded and when we attempt to update the

When the resource is not locked and its template ID hasn't changed since we
