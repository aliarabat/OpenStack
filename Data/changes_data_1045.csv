The LXC container creation playbook is one of the longest-running playbooks
in the repository.  It generally takes 15-17 minutes to run during the gate
jobs.  Much of this time is spent updating each container with the latest
packages.

This patch causes the LXC cached image to be updated one time before that
image is used for all of the containers.  It reduces the amount of times the
updates actually run and this shortens the time it takes to complete the
playbook.

The updates to the cached image will only occur if a new cache image has
just been downloaded.

specified the test by path.  The problem is
that even though in the case of -n we parse
out path and convert to import notation, we
weren't using the parsed our variable in the
call_subunit_run call.

Also, it turns out that --pdb and -n are really
both work just fine calling call_subunit_run.  So
we can remove the def call_testtools_run and just
consolidate pdb and -n into a single statement and
runner call.

I looked at using a secondary exclusive group
between no-discover and pdb, but it it shouldn't
matter if a user tries to specify both, the or
statement should evaluate correctly and things
should just work even if it's pointless to type
in `tox -epy27 -- -n --pdb project.tests.test_name`.

During attach_volume operation, initialize_connection in Cinder
is called. If timeout happens during initialize_connection, the
volume state will be changed back to available.
However, volume could be already mapped to the host on the array.
This leaves the database and array out of sync. If rescan happens
on the host after this, the volume will be visible to the host.
Then if the so-called available volume is deleted, a faulty
device will remain in the host.

This patch handles exception during initialize_connection and
a rollback is triggered by calling terminate_connection in
Cinder.

While working on some other patches and trying to add

made it difficult to test.

Rather than try and be super tricky, just refactor os_testr
a bit.

* Refactor get_parser to handle parse_args for us
  We'll need to explicitly pass in argv here
* Move the logic of selecting/calling the test
  runner into its own helper method (_select_call_runner)
* Modify existing tests to pass args in to get_parser
* Add a new test for runner selection

This cleans up the logic a bit and makes testing a good
deal easier.

Adds a configuration option to use the root helper in the ip netns list
command executed by the IP library when checking for the existence of a
namespace.  This prevents an unprivileged l3 agent from erroneously trying
to create another namespace when one already exists. This is necessary in
environments with constrained permissions on /var/run/netns via umask or
other access controls.

However, due to the overhead incurred by calling sudo every time on systems
where this restriction isn't in place, this configuration won't be desired
all of the time. So this patch also adds a sanity check that reports back
whether or not the root_helper is required for a deployment.

The --no-discover option is cool, and it turns out
it has everything needed to work on tests specified
by path.

The only thing missing was that the actual call for
subunit_run was using the opts.no_discover arg and
not the parsed out test_to_run var that somebody
was nice enough to go through the trouble to implement.

This patch just uses that var and now if somebody wants
they can specify test by path.

Also, there's no need for a separate call_testtools_run
method any longer.  The subunit_run call handles
breakpoints just fine so condense both no-discover and
pdb  calls to just use subunit_run and we can remove
call_testtools_run altogether.

We add a force wait for vif unplug events from neutron because some
operations like rebuilding require the VM to be completely unplugged or
neutron will never send a vifplugged notification since the port status
does not change.

The default is for this event to not be fatal and simply log a warning
but can be configured to re-raise the exception. Regardless the instance
is cleaned up and destroyed.

as we are going to add iSCSI target server utils classes and
other initiator types.

The default Django User model PK is an int() AutoField
and django-openstack-auth sets this to a hash string. Django
then breaks trying to coerce that string to an int().

This patch adds a new explicit PK to the d-o-a User
model. It also adds the standard Django ""models.py"" so
that the consumer application (Horizon) may use it.

The consumer application must set:

   AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'openstack_auth.User'

to use the new model in place of the default 'auth.User'.

This is basically a revert of commit 80c109f85a9e8b182e918027731760e91026cb81

The commit 1d4ad44f15503b8710ff59dea9f5e3f4894d56fb missed to bump
the PciDeviceList version also the relationship with Instance
object.

The later commit 80c109f85a9e8b182e918027731760e91026cb81 fixed
that. That commit make the CD user can upgrade to that commit
successful. And after that commit 363ef82a66cb3b3528de03686f79f7c13ef33305
revert the relationship between Instance and PciDeviceList to the
right one. But that leads to the kilo stable user (or running the
code before commit 363ef82a66cb3b3528de03686f79f7c13ef33305)
can't upgrade the code to Liberty.

So when the system run Liberty controller and Kilo stable compute
node(or before commit 363ef82a66cb3b3528de03686f79f7c13ef33305),
the booing instance is broken. The reason is Kilo compute node only
know PciDeviceList 1.1, but the Liberty conductor will return
PciDeviceList 1.2 based on the relationship.

This patch adjusts Instance and PciDeviceList relationship to
""1.20: 1.2"". Due to Kilo stable only support 1.19, that makes
Liberty conductor only backport 1.1 for Instance < 1.20.

Previously, if you uploaded a segment reference with '{""size_bytes"":
null, ...}' in it and the referenced segment was less than 1 MiB,
you'd get a response that looked like this:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Length: 62
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

    Date: Wed, 26 Aug 2015 00:33:30 GMT

    Each segment, except the last, must be at least 1048576 bytes.

This is true, but not particularly helpful, since it doesn't tell you
which of your segments violated the rule.

Now you get something more like this:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Length: 49
    Content-Type: text/plain
    X-Trans-Id: tx586e52580bac4956ad8e2-0055dd09c2

    Errors:
    /segs/small, Too Small (minimum 1048576B)

It's not exactly a tutorial on SLO manifests, but at least it names
the problematic segment.

I also split the error checking into two steps: first, SLO does all
the checks it can without making any subrequests. If there are errors
in that first pass, like a size_bytes that's *specified* as too small
or a self-referential manifest, then SLO returns those errors. This
way we don't waste time doing a bunch of HEAD requests for something
we already know is bogus. Second pass is all the
HEAD-request-and-check-matching stuff that SLO already does.

The TrustedFilter is the only in-tree scheduler filter that calls an external
3rd-party service (OpenAttestation) for decision-making. Thus, the OAT service
is not listed as an official Nova dependency and consequently not even gated,
even by a 3rd-party CI.

Besides, some discussions have been captured in a ML thread that show that
running this filter is not the best way for enforcing trusted compute nodes [1]
but I leave that out of the review (just a FYI) because the main reason for
making experimental the filter is to send a signal to operators that they will
either have to find another solution or accept the current gaps.

In preparation for the release, do some cleanups for translations.

Removes all po files that are partially translated. The translation
team has decided to exclude files with less than 66 % of translated
content. There is no content lost, all data is in the translation
server, we just remove it from the repository.

This updates also recreates pot (translation source files) to
reflect the state of the repository in case there was no recent
import for them.

This change needs to be done manually since the automatic import does
not handle some of these cases.

During the post_live_migration step for the Nova libvirt driver
an incorrect assumption is being made about the connector
information being sent to _disconnect_volume. It is assumed that
the connection information on the source and destination is the
same but that is not always the case. The BDM, where the
connector information is being retrieved from only contains the
connection information for the destination. This will not work
when trying to disconnect volumes from the source during live
migration as the properties such as the target_lun and
initiator_target_map could be different. This ends up leaving
behind dangling LUNs and possibly removing the incorrect
volume's LUNs.

The solution proposed here utilizes the connection_info that
can be retrieved for a host from Cinder's initialize_connection
API. This connection information contains the correct data for
the source host and allows volume LUNs to be removed properly.

* unittest.assertXXX provides more detailed message when test fail,

There are a few places in the PUT path where the object server is
reading WSGI input and can find that there's nothing there.  e.g. in the
middle of a 2 phase commit and the proxy goes away for whatever reason,
like maybe it timed out because things are really busy.  Anyway, this
results in the ugly ValueError coming out of eventlet.wsgi about a
zillion levels away from the PUT path.

Expanding on the test cases from lp bug #1496205 and lp bug #1469094
this change carefully narrows into our read/readline calls to
wsgi_input and makes sure to tranlsate the ValueError to a
ChunkReadError - which the object.server can handle along with
ChunkReadTimeout.  When it made sense, this change attempts to stay
consistent throughout the code path in logging/raising client disconnect
instead of timeout.

It's unfortunate the error coming out of eventlet is so generic, but
that will be improved in future versions [1].

If the rescue operation fails, the instance is attempted to be
unrescued.

If the original configdrive was not detached during the
rescue operation, the unrescue operation will fail as it
will attempt to attach an already attached disk.

This patch fixes the issue by checking if the configdrive is
already mounted before attempting to reattach it.

Currently when application get deleted its servers are also get deleted,
but all underlying allocated OpenStack resources remain so.

This commit makes the following to happen upon deletion:
* Exclude OS::Nova::Server resource from the stack
* Exclude all FloatingIP and related resources allocated for the server
* Exclude Neutron ports allocated to the server
* Exclude all Heat Software Configs (in case of HeatSWConfigInstance)
   created by the app
* Exclude all HOT template outputs related to deleted resources

Also:
* Instance class gets releaseResources method that can be used by apps to explicitly
  destroy the server. It can be recreated later again using deploy method
* The order in which .destroy() methods get called was changed so that the owner's
   destructor be called before that of the owned object. For example application
   destructor will be executed prior to its Instance destructor. This allows application
   to delete all references to the server that is going to be destroyed. Thus Heat template
   remains consistent.

On recent Heat version last modification timestamp changes on

Murano waited indefinitely and deployment hung.

Current install_os_domU.sh depends on some keywords which are changed in the
next version XenServer which is upgraded to CentOS 7. So with the existing
script to install domU in the new version XenServer, it will always fail.
This patch is to make it to be compatible with all XenServer versions:
1. the output format of ""ifconfig"" is changed; the fix is to use the ip
   command to retrieve IP address.
2. In XS 6.5 and the previous XS, the ""xe-guest-utilities"" package file name
   is as ""xe-guest-utilities_<version>_<arch>.deb"" but now it delivers a
   single file for all Arch's and the file name is
   ""xe-guest-utilities_<version>_all.deb"". In order to make it to be
   compatible, the fix will try to search the old file name pattern by
   default. If it does't exist, then try to search the new file name pattern.

The test_should_raise_container_no_content_type_header() is
misnamed.  In this test, the Content-type: header is sent, but
there is no value sent with it.

When webtest processed this request with Python3, it hit an infamous
sting/bytes issue while sending the POST.  The issue was hit in webtest
and cgi code, not in Barbican code.

From a Barbican point of view, testing
   Content-type: \r\n
and
   Content-type: bad_content_type\r\n
runs through the same code, fails the same test, and throws the
same exception.

Therefore, I propose we rename and change the test case to the second
case.  Webtest does not have a problem handling this test in Python3.
The same conditions are tested and verified for Python2 and 3.

In preparation for the release, do some cleanups for translations.

Removes all po files that are partially translated. The translation
team has decided to exclude files with less than 66 % of translated
content. There is no content lost, all data is in the translation
server, we just remove it from the repository.

This updates also recreates pot (translation source files) to
reflect the state of the repository in case there was no recent
import for them.

This change needs to be done manually since the automatic import does
not handle some of these cases.

Currently the validation code for template-validate is different to
that used for create/preview/update, which can lead to inconsistent
results as the implementations have diverged.

So instead align more closely with the actual validation, which
should also enable easier validation of nested stacks which is
currently not possible.

On recent Heat version last modification timestamp changes on
update start rather than finish. As a result when stack exits from
IN_PROGRESS state timestamp doesn't change any longer.
But Murano also waited for timestamp to change. As a result
Murano waited indefinitely and deployment hung.

With this change IN_PROGRESS status will no longer set
last modification timestamps. So now we will be comparing
timestamps between 2 terminal statuses rather than between
last UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS and UPDATE_COMPLETE that
now have the same timestamp.

These jobs clone and build a repository from github within a
devstack plugin.  In order to do so, they must disable ERROR_ON_CLONE
which is our assurance that all tested OpenStack projects are in
the $PROJECTS variable.

Further, OpenStack projects must not clone non-OpenStack repositories
in gate tests -- they should either be consuming OpenStack projects
from git via the $PROJECTS variable or installing released packages
as dependencies.  For Midonet, that likely either means via the
operating system, or via a maven repository.  If via maven, then we
will need some commitment from the Midonet team to set up a maven
mirror similar to our pypi mirror so that when we run tests we are
not relying on external network resources.

This patch contains several fixes to the cluster-update behavior:

- It makes the CLUSTER_UPDATE action invoke the cluster.do_update()
  method.
- It makes the cluster.status is correctly set when action is executed.
- It removes the extra calls to cluster.store() during update action.
- It allows the cluster.set_status() call to accept keyword arguments
  when doing update. [This is opening a door for optimization in other
  places where set_status() is called.]
- It ensures the cached data of the cluster is refreshed, i.e. the
  profile object.

Add a new subcommand to the `verify` command to import tempest results
into an existing deployment in the Rally database. `verify import`
will read a tempest log in subunit format, and import it into the
current deployment (or the one specified in the command line)

The command should be called as

  $ rally verify import --file [log_file] --deployment [uuid]

This version of the patch will require a normal deployment to be
created beforehand.  Also, the log_file needs to be a tempest log in
subunit format; `--file` parameter is required.

Apart from `--file` and `--deployment` parameters, this command
understand `--set-name` and `--no-use` from the `start`
command. `--set-name` can be used to attach a name or a small
description to the tempest result, and `--no-use` will mark the new
verification object as a no-current. So, for example, if we want to
assign a name to the tempest result we can use:

  $ rally verify import --file [log_file] --set-name [name] \
          --deployment [uuid]

The `test_trans_add` test in `manila.tests.test_hacking.HackingTestCase`
consistently failed on our CI system, which is based on Ubuntu 14.04.
Contrary, on my development machine running Fedora 22, all tests
succeeded. Whilst the test dispatches on Python version (`if six.PY2`)
to select which `hacking` errors are expected, at which line/column
pair, I noticed our CI system returned the expected values for Python 2,
not the Python 3 ones, which differ in column numbers only.

After verifying versions of dependencies, stepping through the code and
whatnot, the only difference left turned out to be the version of Python
being used: 3.4.2 on my workstation, 3.4.3 on our CI system. As a last
resort, I opened the Python 3.4 ChangeLog [1] and noticed a suspicious
entry::

    Issue #21295: Revert some changes (issue #16795) to AST line numbers
    and column offsets that constituted a regression.

Looking at those issues, it becomes clear this is the cause. Supposedly
the Python 3 specific expected values were created on a Python 3.4
version containing the original patch of #16795 [2], and this is also
what's running on the OpenStack CI system. Our CI system runs a build of
Python which contains the revert of #21295 [3].

This patch fixes the version-specific expected error calculation by not
simply dispatching on Python 2 or 3, but specifically limits the custom
version to 3.4.0 <= Python < 3.4.3.

It can be quite useful to have admin endpoints for healthcheck
middleware provide more information about the health of the system.

To enable this kind of information this initial step starts to
add a jinja2 template that will produce the existing simple case
by default, but when setup with detailed mode it can then produce
more information about which checks were performed and there results.

It can be expanded in the future to provide more information as
desired (possibly showing more useful application level info when

gerritbot/channels.yaml is a mix of 2- and 4-space indents.
In order to simplify programmatic manipulation of this file,
this makes all indentation 2 spaces.

In addition, it sorts the lists of projects for each channel.

This is motivated by the upcoming mass stackforge namespace renames.

Previously devstack-gate only timed out the default gate_hook within the
gate_hook itself. This meant that any other hooks either
pre_test/post_test or non default gate_hooks would not be timed out
properly preventing the copying of logs before Jenkins times out the
build.

We can fix this by wrapping all hook calls with timeouts instead of
expecting the hooks themselves to manage the timeouts. Note that this
requires us to fork and exec a new shell which can be run under timeout
because timeout cannot timeout shell functions.

Removes all po files that are partially translated. The translation
team has decided to exclude files with less than 66 % of translated
content. There is no content lost, all data is in the translation
server, we just remove it from the repository.

This updates also recreates pot (translation source files) to
reflect the state of the repository in case there was no recent

This change needs to be done manually since the automatic import does

The change introduces the `config_template` plugin within our ansible
source tree with the intention to replace the `copy_update` module with
a proper ansible action plugin.

The new module implements a method to overwrite and add items into
configuration files without the need to specify all items in templates
as default variables.

The plugin currently supports ini, json, and yaml files and can be
a drop in replacement for the current template and copy_update
usage as it pertains to the various configuration files that we need
for OpenStack.

Partially implements: blueprint tunable-openstack-configuration

This commit removes the neutron pg jobs from the periodic qa pipeline.
These were added without asking anyone from QA core and they just
generate ML spam on a list we really want to retire. Also from what I
can tell these have never worked as long as they've been reporting.
We really need a better place for jobs like this to report and have
better tracking, then just a daily ML message.

swagger_client uses PoolManager from urllib3. PoolManager keeps the
connection_pool_kw passed during the init time and uses the same later
while initiating HTTPSConnection. Existing implementation instantiates
RESTClientObject() at import time, without giving an option to pass
the security parameters, viz. key_file, ca_certs etc. So we needed to
change the way instantiation/initialization was happening.

We're close to the end of porting all unit tests
to be compatible with python34. However, ~8 tests are skipped
specifically in python34 because of bugs mostly in mox3.
Those tests will likely have to be converted to mock in
the future. Note that from now on, every test added will have
to be python34 compatible.

Also, fix __str__ function of ExceptionGroup in test_scheduler.
It intentionally uses str so as to not flatten the unicode
literal in python2.7 and also be compatible with python3.4
