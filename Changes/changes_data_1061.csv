Change options requirement testing so that it is performed on the base
load_from_options method. This will mean it gets shared between all
loading mechanisms.

I removed the verify_auth function because it is a bit too specific to
the OSC/OCC case. auth_type is not something that is part of
keystoneauth. I also modified the exception as it should no longer take
the plugin name as this would be knowledge any calling function has.

OSC/OCC could use this function to implement a higher level error
message, but I think it should be keystoneauth's responsibility to
validate auth plugins and they should just offload the options.

Instances will currently alternate between
BUILD->ACTIVE->BUILD->ACTIVE on create. This was
happening because a race condition existed between
the datastore sending heartbeats that the service is
ACTIVE before and the prepare call manually stopping
the service to bring the status back to BUILD.

The fix is to add an optional param force to set_status
that is going to be set to True for end_install_or_restart
which is called at the end of prepare for all datastores either
directly or through app.complete_install_or_restart(). When
set_status is called it will now check if the instance status
was currently BUILDING and if the force flag is False. This
means that the prepare call has not yet finished and to skip
the heartbeat from updating the status. Once prepare is finished
it will call complete_install_or_restart which will in turn
call end_install_or_restart and force the status to be updated
from BUILD to ACTIVE. If setting status to FAILED or
BUILD_PENDING it will never skip the heartbeat.

For mongodb I added complete_install_or_restart to service.py
to be called at the end of prepare for single instance mongo
instead of calling set_status directly to RUNNING.

Cleaned up BaseDbStatusTests and added new tests covering new

When creating a volume from an image, cinder copies the image metadata
into volume properties. When booting from the volume, we read this
metadata from the volume and use it as image metadata once again.

While fixing the check against min_ram,
change I861a78b5c7efa71e4bf7206d388b8d0d8048c78e introduced a
regression which prevents a user from booting a volume which is larger
than the flavor's disk. As we are not creating this disk, this check
does not make sense. Similarly, it checks the image metadata's
min_disk against the flavor disk size, which is not being used.

This change leaves the image metadata check unaltered when creating a
flavor disk. When booting from a volume, we check min_disk from image
metadata against the actual size of the volume. We don't check the
volume size at all. The check against min_ram is retained unaltered.

This is a request to add the App Catalog to the OpenStack
namespace.  The Community App Catalog is a collection of
ready-to-use applications, Heat templates and machine images, and
other OpenStack components that you can immediately deploy into
your OpenStack cloud.

The project was  developed in coordination with the OpenStack
Foundation, and is hosted by OpenStack Infra at
http://apps.openstack.org.  This project is already using all of
the OpenStack infrastructure and services and is gated through
gerrit.

We are using the both the Dev and Operators mailing list, and
bring up initiatives on the mailing lists in order to provide
ample opportunity for those in the community to provide feedback,
and so everyone can be kept aware of our progress and intentions.
We also hold weekly IRC meetings[1] which are announced
regularly, and logged for review.

The IRC channel #openstack-app-catalog is logged[2], and active
with community members, core developers and like minded people
all helping and discussing issues within the project as well as
questions that come up from using the App Catalog or adding
content to it.

Christopher Aedo has been acting as the temporary PTL, and has
been actively working with the App Catalog since before it was
officially launched at the Vancouver summit. We plan to hold an
official PTL election before the Tokyo summit.

This commit is a formal request to add the Community App Catalog
into the OpenStack namespace as an official project.

There's a corner case where password may be requested twice. In a fresh
environment, when schemas have not be downloaded for v2, the client will
ask for a password to download the schemas and then it'll ask for the
password again to run the actual command. This happens because we parse
the CLI arguments twice to make sure we're parsing them for the right
client version.

This patch checks if the password is unset in the newly parsed arguments
and if it's been set in the previously parsed ones. In this case it
keeps the set password. I believe this approach is safer than re-using
the already parsed arguements which may have been parsed for a different
API version (might happen because we fallback to v1 if v2 is not
available).

we just had rst files in the root of the repo and relied on github
or something else to render them. After this commit we'll support
sphinx built docs.

The next step after this is to add a docs publishing job to infra so
we'll have hosted grenade documentation like other projects.

The Hyper-V driver uses the Microsoft\Windows\SMB WMI namespace
in order to handle SMB shares. The issue is that this namespace is
not available on Windows versions prior to Windows Server 2012.

For this reason, the Hyper-V driver fails to initialize on Windows
Server 2008 R2.

This patch fixes the issue by properly handling the PathUtils
initialization.

Nova Hyper-V driver fails to detach virtual hard disks when using
the virtualizaton v1 WMI namespace. This affects Windows Server
2008 as well as Windows Server 2012 when the old namespace is used.

The reason is that it cannot find the attached resource,
using the wrong resource object connection attribute.

This patch fixes the issue by using the right resource connection
attribute when attempting to find an attached virtual disk resource
by its path.

these exceptions require different actions by the user. The new

Patchset fixes calculating EC2_URL/S3_URL for user rc files in 'accrc' directory.
Currently calculation of these url's uses 'openstack endpoint show' command
without specifying os-identity-v3 flag. But output is empty without such flag.
So this patchset uses same construction as exists in functions-common.

Signing requests are expected to arrive at

/v1/sign/<registration_authority>

now. Virtual registration authority is a new concept which right now includes
everything the original configuration included. That means for example each
registration authority available within Anchor deployment can configure its own
CA, auth, and validators. Clients request a specific registration authority via
the URL. This does not mean they can just choose who signs the CSR - they still
need to pass all checks. Only the guesswork of ""which validation set applies to
them"" is gone because of this change.

The previous concept of validator sets is gone. Each registration authority
configures its own validators and all of them need to pass.

Previous endpoint /sign will not work anymore. It's incompatible with
the new design.

The configuration file changes in the following way:
1. Registration authorities need to be defined in the main config.
2. Validator sets are not available anymore.
3. CA and auth settings at the top level need to be named. They can be referred
   to in the registration authority block.
4. Old names are removed. Any use of ""auth"", ""ca"", or ""validators"" at the top
   level will result in an error and explanation regarding the upgrade path.

Further documentation and a sample config with the new layout can be found in
the docs/configuration.rst file.

conventions whenever possible to keep our tests properly separated
and in conventional locations.

If an event comes in that does not have a associated router_id, we attempt
to call out to neutron to resolve it by tenant_id and cache it locally on
the TenantRouterManager instance. This happens during get_state_machines()
and, if a router could not be found, the event msg effectively gets dropped.

This is a bit of a waste of Neutron calls if the event happens to be one
that would be ignored later on by the worker (for global or tenant debug,
for example)

This moves that caching out to the worker using a dumb in-memory dict based
cache (we could back this by memcache and improve it if it ends up being
beneficial)  Instead of having the TRM decide to drop messages with no
associated router, we move that responsibility up to the worker where its
already doing similar things around debug modes.  Ensuring the worker has
visibility of the router_id at all times will later let it use this as a
hash key when RUGs are managed using a distributed hash ring.

The Monasca API states that dimensions may not begin with an underscore;
as such no dimensions should be returned that begin with an underscore,
even if they are in the database.

This issie was exposed by new behaviour in InfluxDB 0.9.0 which resulted
in a _key column always being included in returned output. This feature
is scheduled to be removed in 0.9.3, (see
https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/3076) but monasca-api should still
be robust against this behaviour.

There were several examples showing passing an
exception in as the message text to a call to
LOG.exception. LOG.exception will automatically
log the exception details, so doing something
like this results in the exception information
being written out twice.

To prevent the possibility of someone seeing these
examples and assuming that is the correct way to
use LOG.exception, examples have been updated to
use LOG.error instead to illustrate the correct
way to pass in exceptions in the message string.

There are cases where it takes a long time to create a new resource as
requested by the scaling operation on an ASG resource, for instance, a
nova server creation followed by a complex SoftwareDeployment. During
this process, additional alarms may come in but failed to be blocked
by the current cooldown checking mechanism because the very first
timestamp has yet to be generated. This is leading to unexpected size
adjustment to the ASG.

This patch augments the existing cooldown checking mechanism with a
scaling-in-progress test so that additional alarms arriving during
the very first scaling operation will be ignored.

This commit adds support to the cDOT driver for the driver methods
manage_existing and unmanage.  The logic follows three sections:

1. Locate the resource to be managed, which is specified as the
cDOT flexvol name in the export_path argument.
2. Ensure the flexvol to be brought under Manila management is
of the appropriate type, the extra specs from the share type are
valid and match the specified pool, and the flexvol has no LUNs
or other flexvols mounted underneath it.
3. Rename the flexvol using normal Manila naming conventions,
remount it on a new path matching the new name, update it to
conform to all relevant qualified extra specs, and remove any
existing export rules.

oslo_utils.timeutils.isotime() is deprecated as of 1.6 so we need
to stop using it.

This patch replaces timeutils.isotime(dt) with dt.isoformat() as
the deprecation message suggests in oslo_utils.timeutils.
However this might be a backward incompatible change as
timeutils.isotime() produced '1955-11-05T18:00:00Z' format
but datetime.isoformat() produces '1955-11-05T18:00:00+00:00'
format.

The following places still use the deprecated method because
oslo.versionedobject also use it:

* nova.tests.unit.objects.test_objects
* nova.tests.unit.objects.test_fields
* nova.tests.unit.objects.test_instance

The above places will be fixed after oslo.versionedobject are fixed

Before this patch, if user's rights were changed
or revoked - there would be ""Unauthorized"" errors
on every page since user had no rights to view them
because he had no valid tokens in that case.

Now user will be logged out if he has no valid tokens.
Set `escalate` to True (for unauthorized-error)
to always log user out.

Also, now horizon.exceptions.NotAuthorized is a part of
UNAUTHORIZED tuple in the exceptions.py, because this type
of exception is re-raised after handling services unauthorized errors.
Looks like it was missing. Now the horizon.exceptions.NotAuthorized
is handled like all NotAuthorized exceptions.

And horizon_middleware.py in process_exception now generates
logout_reason for cases if user is not authorized.

The connect method of ssync_sender tells the remote connection that it's
going to send a valid HTTP chunked request, but if the remote end needs
to respond with an error of any kind sender throws HTTP right out the
window, picks up his ball, and closes the socket down hard - much to the
surprise of the eventlet.wsgi server who up to this point had been
playing along quite nicely with this 'SSYNC' nonsense assuming that
everyone here is consenting mature adults.

If you're going to make a ""Transfer-Encoding: chunked"" request have the
good decency to finish the job with a proper '0\r\n\r\n'. [1]

N.B. It might be possible to handle an error status during the
initialize_request phase with some sort of 100-continue support, but
honestly it's not entirely clear to me when the server isn't going to
close the connection if the client is still expected to send the body
[2] - further if the error comes later during missing_check or updates
we'll for sure want to send the chunk transfer termination line before
we close down the socket and this way we cover both.

According to Python 3 Porting guide
http://docs.pythonsprints.com/python3_porting/py-porting.html

Exceptions were changed in a few ways for Python 3. First, strings
are no longer usable as exceptions. Additionally, the raise syntax no
longer accepts comma-separated arguments, instead working with exception
instances. Perhaps the largest difference in Python 3 is that exception
objects are only available via the as keyword, which was introduced in
2.6.

Creating a port on a prefix delegation enabled subnet with a fixed ip
list containing only the subnet id will cause a DBDuplicateEntry error.
This is because the subnet is not treated as an ipv6 auto address subnet
as it should be by _test_fixed_ips_for_port in ipam_non_pluggable_backend.py

All IPV6 PD subnets are auto address subnets, so the additional check was
unnecessary and incorrect in this case.

This patch changes the condition for appending the subnet id to the
fixed_ip_set so that PD subnets are treated the same as auto address
subnets. Also includes a unit test to catch this failure.

Some Intel cards don't support setting link state, so to
resolve it the SR-IOV mech driver supports agent and agent less mode.
From Liberty the SR-IOV agent brings more functionality like
qos and port security so we want to make the agent mandatory.
(of course I already talked with Intel Guys to get their approval)

This patch deprecates the agent_required in Liberty
and updates the agent_required default to be True.

Add support for django 1.8 and remove support for unsupported Django
releases.

Django 1.8 is the new long term stable release for Django. Django
1.4, the last LTS release, will not be supported starting October 1,
2015. Django 1.5 and 1.6 are not longer supported.
See: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions

Horizon and django_openstack_auth have added support for Django 1.8.
django_openstack_auth 1.4.0 supports 1.7 and 1.8. Horizon master in
Liberty supports 1.7-1.8 currently and has non-voting 1.8 gate
jobs that are passing.

This proposed fix is to change Nova to set up port bindings via

This is a small change consisting of mostly boilerplate code.

Tripleo is in the process of changing from tripleo-incubator/devtest
driven CI to CI driven by instack.

Until we are confident that the instack based CI is reliable and
gives us the coverage we want. We are removing our CI from all non tripleo
projects, with the exceptions of heat, ironic, neutron and nova as we have
found a lot of value in running running our CI on these projects in the past.
For these 4 projects the instack jobs will be available in the
experimental-tripleo queue.

Remove the ubuntu based jobs as instack doesn't currently support them
and there isn't currently any users interested in adding support.

Puppet & Tempest runs in case of failures.

This patch aims to copy the log file only if it exists.

The SolidFire driver uses a simple method of gathering
the Storage Virtual IP, it just queries the Cluster and
asks for the SVIP. This is great almost all the time,
BUT it doesn't take into consideration that the deployer
may be using VLAN's and accessing the cluster from multiple
clouds, or multiple networks.

This patch just adds a config option to specify an SVIP
if the admin has configured VLANs in their environment and
on their cluster.  The default behavior is to still use the
global SVIP.

The 0.9.8 release had a newer minimum pbr dependency from liberty which
doesn't work with capped pbr in stable/kilo. So we need to block 0.9.8
from kilo and cap at 0.10.0 which is what liberty will use. This leaves
us wiggle room for 0.9.x updates in kilo for bug fixes.

Unfortunately we'll have to sync this to the server projects in

so keystone cannot be started because ports are already in use.

So this patch installs Apache on eventlet manifest and makes sure the

Previosly the volume UDID was stored in the connection information
with the key being the VIOS UUID and the volume ID.  Those data
points are not needed because the UDID does not vary with the
VIOS that it's mapped to and the volume ID is already stored
in the data section of the connection information.  This change
simplifies the storage by using a static key 'target_UDID' to
store the UDID value.

Several problems exist with Horizon on centos+binary:

1. The default setup of http binds a port to port 80 on RPM
   based distros.

2. There is no horizon user/group added causing config-external
   to break badly.

3. openstack-dashboard is installed in
   /usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard. This
   is incompatible with the expectations of the wsgi configuration.

4. the target for config-external is
   /etc/httpd/sites.d/horizon.conf. It should be
   /etc/httpd/conf.d/horizon.conf

5. A workaround is required for:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1220070

6. Static display requires compressing the installation via
   manage.py.  To do this correctly pyscss needs to be upgraded
   because the version in RDO is broken.

it's already there. The script is the same for all deployments so we
don't need to write it over and over. This also makes it easier to test

We're working on updating the Barbican devstack plugin, and some changes
would be breaking for the existing gate. This experimental job is to
allow us to test the new job definition without risking temporary
breakage to the gate. This is the change on the Barbican side:

https://review.openstack.org/#/c/167885/

This experimental job is a very minor tweak of the existing gate job, so
hopefully merging this is trivial. It will be removed as soon as it is
shown to work and the primary gate job is updated to match.

There is a single RPC method used to both create and update block device
mappings in a parent cell.  Based on arguments passed to it it will
either create/update/update_or_create the block device mapping.  This
could cause duplicate bdms to be created if multiple update_or_create
calls come in quickly.  Instead the update_or_create argument should
only be used when sending the first RPC message to the parent cell.

There's additional complexity here in that a bdm object create() call
should create the bdm and all save() calls should update.  However
create() doesn't send an update message if device_name isn't set due to
uniqueness being determined by a combination of instance uuid and device
name.  So save() needs to use update_or_create if device name is being
changed, and update all other times.

Now that we have added the fields for persisting the allocation ratios, we can
have the ResouceTracker persisting them by adding them to the local ComputeNode
object which is persisted by calling the _update() method.
It will then send by default 0.0 unless the operator explicitely specified an
allocation ratio in the compute nova.conf.

Thanks to the ComputeNode object hydratation on the scheduler side, the facade
will make sure that if a default 0.0 is provided by either a compute node or
by the scheduler's nova.conf, it will actually get the original allocation
ratios (ie. 16.0 and 1.5)
Since the Scheduler reads the same RT opts but goes thru the ComputeNode object,
it will also get the Facade returning 16.0 and 1.5 unless the operator
explicitely provided other ratios for the scheduler's nova.conf

That compat mode (having ratios defaulted to 0.0) is only planned to be kept for
Liberty and will be removed in the next release (Mitaka) in order to leave to
the operators a whole cycle to update all their computes' nova.conf files
if they want to have a specific allocation ratio for their compute nodes.

Note: that BP now allows to provide a specific allocation ratio per compute.

As we want to provide a per-compute allocation ratio for both CPU and RAM,
we need to persist them to the compute_nodes table and add them to the
ComputeNode object.
Note: Since we need to provide a compatibility path for upgrades and as we
don't want to ask the operators to change their config files before upgrading,
we then verify the allocation ratio value to match if defaulted and then return
an hardcoded value identitical to the behaviour we want.
In order to know if the compute related opt values were updated, we plan to
change the ratios defaults with 0.0 in a later change
(I382421968d4c7989a6ff08c74c21139bf6be12e5)

Xenserver relies on guest (domU) to provide information about
the presence of PV drivers in the guest image back to dom0 though
xenstore.

It is possible for users to disable the xen agent that reports this
info and therefore causing failures in live-migration. The agent is
only responsible for reporting guest infomation to dom0, and is not
directly responsible for any live-migration activity. Therefore, in
cases where PV drivers are running it is safe to fake the presence of
this information in xenstore. This plugin checks for such cases and
writes a fake PV tools information prior to live-migration.

The information about the presence of pv driver or version is read
straight though xenstore and written back to xenstore.

This information is checked by xapi (not nova) during live migration.

Move the ResourceTracker._instance_in_resize_state() method to a simple
module-level function, since nothing in the method actually accessed the
resource tracker object anyway, and testing a simple function means we
can test it without the hassle of creating the resource tracker in the
test cases.

Also removes a duplicate test_claim() method from the
test_resource_tracker module that was already in the NoDBTestCase-based
test_tracker.MoveClaimTestCase object. The idea behind this and the next
patches are to reduce the amount of test code changes required when
changing the PciDeviceTracker's constructor and its instantiation in the
resource tracker.

When the compute driver methods called the instance_exists() method to

The code recently added to clean up the compute monitor loading to use
stevedore was assuming a single type of compute monitor: cpu monitors.
This patch allows multiple monitor types, namespaced by the directory in
nova/compute/monitors. The NUMA memory bandwidth monitor is the next
monitor namespace to be proposed, and this code sets up that patch
series.

DocImpact: This patch provides the infrastructure for non-CPU compute
monitors to be loaded properly by the stevedore extension manager. The
CONF.compute_monitors configuration option previously supported only CPU
monitors, and so the format of the configuration option (which is a
multi-list option) looked like this: CONF.compute_monitors = ['virt_driver'],
which could be read as ""Use the virt_driver CPU monitor"". Now, non-CPU
monitors can be loaded by the extension manager, and so a namespace
prefix is also considered. For example, setting CPU.compute_monitors to
['cpu.virt_driver', 'numa_mem_bw.virt_driver'] would allow the loading
of both the virt_driver CPU monitor and the virt_driver NUMA memory
bandwidth monitor. To preserve backwards compatibility, if there is no
namespace given, the 'cpu.' namespace is assumed.

This change set optimizes how the extended attributes are determined
within the driver.  The Storage XAG is a very expensive extended
attribute, with each query taking a couple seconds.  The MAPPING XAGs
are linear with the number of mappings on the system.

As such, it is best to determine which XAGs are needed ahead of time to
minimize the amount needed to gather.

The behavior is such that a default deploy only needs SCSI Mappings (for
vOpt and local/SSP disks).  The volume adapters vary what they need.
NPIV needs Storage and FC Mappings.  The vSCSI adapter only requires the
SCSI mappings (turns out the Storage mapping is NOT required there -
further testing showed).

Therefore a new method was introduced called _get_inst_xag.  It takes in
some information (including bdms).  If a volume is provided, it will
determine from the volume adapter what XAG attributes are required.

This should significantly speed up all deploys that do not require NPIV
volume adapter connections.  As further volume adapters are added, this
framework should be flexible to handle the new mechanisms as well.

This method also re-introduces a vSCSI optimization that was lost in a
recent refactoring.  It gathers the physical WWPNs once up front and
caches them.

There was a conditional checking either the vm_state or the task_state to see
if it was an IO operation. By thinking on it, there are 5 calls to the scheduler
for asking a destination :
 - build_instances
 - cold_migrate
 - live_migrate
 - unshelve
 - rebuild

All of them will try to find a destination and consume_from_instance() will be
decrementing the host resources by the instance usage, which means it's an I/O
operation anyway.

Also, the current implementation is buggy since a live migration is not
considered as an io_ops (the MIGRATING task_state is missing in the conditional...)
so that's a good opportunity for just saying bye-bye to the conditional.
