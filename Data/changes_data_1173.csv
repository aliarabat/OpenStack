In the process of live_migration, if the user does not specify the
destination, the scheduler will choose a suitable host,  but the scheduler
can not choose hosts according to the driver_type and driver_version in
the existing scheduling method, especially in a heterogeneous environment,
it will lead to the migration failure probability increased, so I think
the OpenStack as an excellent choice should be able to deal with this
situation.

Current implementation of live migration in libvirt incorrectly includes
block devices on shared storage (e.g., NFS) when computing destination
storage requirements. Since these volumes are already on shared storage
they do not need to be migrated. As a result, migration fails if the
amount of free space on the shared drive is less than the size of the
volume to be migrated. The problem is addressed by adding a
block_device_info parameter to check_can_live_migrate_source() to allow
volumes to be filtered correctly when computing migration space
requirements.

This only fixes the issue on libvirt: it is unclear whether other
implementations suffer from the same issue.

Thanks to Florent Flament for spotting and fixing an issue while trying out
this patch.

Due to an assumption that libvirt live migrations work only when both
instance path and disk data is shared between source and destination
hosts (e.g. libvirt instances directory is on NFS), instance disks are
removed from shared storage when instance path is not shared (e.g. Ceph
RBD backend is enabled).

Distinguish cases that require shared instance drive and shared libvirt
instance directory. Reflect the fact that RBD backed instances have
shared instance drive (and no shared libvirt instance directory) in the
relevant conditionals.

UpgradeImpact: Live migrations from or to a compute host running a
version of Nova pre-dating this commit are disabled in order to
eliminate possibility of data loss. Upgrade Nova on both the source and
the target node before attempting a live migration.

Currently when booting multiple instances, the instance display-names
will be something like 'test-1,test-2' if we set
multi_instance_display_name_template = %(name)s-%(count)s. Here is the
problem, if we need more instances and want the instance names start
with 'test-3', there is no such way to do so now.

So a new template is introduced to solve the issue: '%(name)s-%(index)s'
If we enter instance name like `test-12` when booting multiple
instances, the display name of the remaining instances will be auto
plus with 1 and begin with `12`.

This patch adds code that implements a scalable approach towards scheduling
VM requests. The nova API directly places the request onto the queue on topics
based on the instance type of the VM.

* Registers config option ""bypass_scheduler"" during conductor initialization.
* Bypasses scheduler and puts the request directly on to the queue based on instance type.
* Validates the host capacity with available instance type.
* Subscribes to queues with instance type which are under the capacity
* Considers ram,cores and disk allocation ratio during the validation.
* Manages inital subscription and un-subscription
* Revalidates subscription when an instance is created or terminated.

- Refactor the main driver class, GlusterFSShareDriver, to make it
  pluggable with different NAS helpers.

   - Add GlusterNFS helper class to manage shares served by Gluster-NFS
     server. The management of these share was earlier done within the
     main driver class.

- Enhance the methods of the GlusterAddress class that would be used
  by the main driver class and the helper classes. Rename the
  GlusterAddress class to GlusterManager class. This class would
  contain the methods to interface with the backend GlusterFS volumes.

   - Retire GlusterAddress.make_gluster_args() in favor of
     GlusterManager.make_gluster_call(). The make_gluster_call() method
     implements a more correct approach to remote execution. It's
     remote execution is based on processutils.ssh_execute. The
     make_gluster_args() method that it replaces facilitated remote
     execution by prefixing arguments with 'ssh'.

   - Move the interface used to fetch the value of an option set on a
     GlusterFS volume, from the main driver class to the GlusterManager
     class.

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that
is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is
completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.
This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was
deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we
cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.
This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of
v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload
process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v2: 410 Gone

keepalived invokes the Neutron notifier scripts when state change
occur. However, when keepalived invokes two consecutive state changes
for the same router, the scripts may execute commands out of order.
For example, keepalived changes the state of an HA router from
fail to master to standby. It invokes notify_master,
then notify_standby.

However, from that point, we have no guarantee of ordering.
When the bug manifests, notify_standby writes 'standby' to the
HA state file, followed by notify_master; Meaning, the order
of notify script execution does not match the order of state
file writing.

The solution is to use flock when executing the scripts.
Note that I tried calling flock from inside the scripts in their
current form (Bash), as well as in a modified Python script,
but then you have no guarantee that the scripts will grab the lock
in the order in which they were executed. Thus the only option
is to use flock when executing the script itself.

In order to call the script through flock without -o,
we must remove any forking in the script itself. This change
moves the metadata proxy managemt from the notifier scripts
back to the agent. This means that the metadata proxy
will be spawned on the standby nodes as well.

I'm open to any alternatives.

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that
is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is
completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.

This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was
deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we
cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.

This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of
v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload
process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v1: 412 Precondition Failed
v2: 410 Gone

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that
is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is
completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.

This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was
deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we
cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.

This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of
v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload
process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v1: 412 Precondition Failed
v2: 410 Gone

Currently you have to destroy the consistency group if you want to
delete these volumes. In the Kilo release, we'll have the ability to
remove a volume from a consistency group, which then can be deleted.

The default service_name in config option (nova_catalog_info and

it is impossible to invoke novaclient APIs from Cinder code without
changing the default value of those config options.

The correct service_name defined in Keystone's config file

Currently, a ThreadPool acquires resources that last until process
exit. You can let the ThreadPool go out of scope, but that doesn't
terminate the worker threads or close file descriptors or anything.

This commit makes it so you can .terminate() a ThreadPool object and
get its resources back. Also, after you call .terminate(), trying to
use the ThreadPool raises an exception so you know you've goofed.

I have some internal code that could really use this, plus it makes
the unit test run not leak resources, which is nice.

Current behavior:
* If data/body is present in manifest file PUT request, the data/body gets
  saved onto disk, just like for a normal object.
* Generally, this data in manifest file is never served on a GET response.
  However, when the manifest object path itself is part of prefix, GET
  response would contain data present in manifest file as well.
* The query param multipart-manifest=get meant to retrieve SLO manifest
  also works in case of DLO manifest. Hence a COPY request with the
  multipart-manifest=get query param would actually copy DLO manifest.

How things should have been:
* The DLO manifest object is supposed to have no content and only have
  X-Object-Manifest metadata header.
* Query param multipart-manifest=get is SLO specific and shouldn't have
  any role in DLO.

This change intends to only document current behaviour and not change it,
assuming there are users who have previously saved some content in DLO
manifest file and/or have been using multipart-manifest=get to fetch
and/or COPY the DLO manifest file with it's content.

Also add on clear methods to the cache type that will be

'Remains' means the amount of a project quota which is not allocated to
users. The added test mocks quota_get_all(), which gets user quota if

subtracting 'hard_limit' returned by fake_quota_get_all() from 'limit',

Allow Resource objects to be built from either an existing object, or be
created from scratch with the given id. This is useful at the Proxy
level when creating interfaces that must work with a Resource in the
end, but will want to be able to either operate on string names or the
Resources returned from other APIs.

An example is that you may want to create an object in the object store
given a previously obtained container object and a string name for the
object. You may also have constructed the Resource for the object ahead
of time and may want to pass that instead of a string name.

Currently the order of VIPs in keepalived.conf is determined
by sorting the VIPs whenever one is added or removed. As it
turns out, keepalived doesn't like it when the primary VIP
changes. One side effect is that virtual routes, in our case
the router's default route, may be removed.

This patch fabricates an IP address on the router's HA interface
and uses it as the primary VIP.

Commit 894f20d9cf57b36ccf9a675c6b2b070d56c9b297 changed the way that
enable_lazy() is being configured in cinder's test cases.  The changes
were required to remove the use of _lazy from the oslo's i18n library.
_lazy was removed from i18n and the code that was accessing the internal
variable broke.  The commit referenced above made changes to remove
the use of _lazy.

The commit, however, changed the behavior of the test cases to only
enable_lazy without disabling it, which diverges from the original
behavior.

This commit uses the new oslo.i18n ToggleLazy fixture (added in 1.3.0).

Many times new deployers get mysterious errors after first setting up their
Swift clusters. Most of the time, the errors are because the values in the ring
are incorrect (e.g. a bad port number). OPTIONS will be used in a ring checker
(which is WIP) that validates values in the ring.

In PostgreSQL unquoted names are case-insensitive.
However, quoted names are case-sensivite.
Unquoted names are implicitly lowercased!

Problem:
Trove guestagent currently uses unquoted names leading to
inproper behavior when the user actually uses names
with uppercase letters.

Example:
trove user-create <id> USERNAME <password>
trove user-show <id> USERNAME

results in a 404 error - user not found on instance,
because the user created is actually ""username"".

Solution:
Make sure we quote user provided names and value strings in
SQL statements in 'guestagent/datastore/postgresql/pgutil.py'.

There is currently a shim in place that is allowing the old

Here are the steps to reproduce:
1. Create a postgresql instance:

trove create postgresql_instance 100 --datastore postgresql
--datastore_version 9.3 --size 1 --databases db1 --users user1:password1

2. Verify it is ACTIVE:

trove list

3. Create a backup of this new instance:

trove backup-create <id> postgresql_instance-backup
--description postgresql_instance-description

4. Verify backup is complete:

trove backup-list

5. Create a new instance, using this backup instance:

trove create postgresql_instance-restored 100 --datastore postgresql
--datastore_version 9.3 --size 1 --backup <backup_id>

Here are the problems:
1. postgresql doesn't migrate the data, when backup_info is passed in.
2. postgresql outputs few benign messages into the stderr stream
during a normal restore procedure.

Here is the solution:
1. make sure that the postgresql manager always migrates the data by
not skipping the that step when recreating an instance from
backup in 'guestagent/datastore/postgresql/manager.py'.
2. watch for the expected error messages in the stderr stream
and avoid raising an exception in response.
Message 'ERROR:  role ""postgres"" already exists'
is expected and does not pose any problems to the restore operation.
We override the default error handling behavior
in 'guestagent/strategies/restore/postgresql_impl.py'.

UPDATES:
- Applied suggested style improvements.
- Use message whitelist rather than sequence.
- Match messages by regex.

reflect this.

Get_user_quota() has a side effect to the argument 'user_quota'. When
getting a settable quota range for a user, this method is called by
get_settable_quotas(). Get_settable_quota() does not expect that the
project quota is set when the user quota is not set. The side effect
makes the settable maximum value incorrectly great.

In this patch, to avoid this side effect and an extra DB access,
get_user_quota() copies the 'user_quota'.

To the unit test, the patch adds the case when the project quota for
floating_ip resource is set. The test mocks _process_quotas() instead
of get_user_quotas() to check the side effect of get_user_quotas().

Using the flavor extra_specs property ""hw_watchdog_action"" was broken.
Scheduling of a new instance always failed with NoValidHostFound error
because of ComputeCapabilitiesFilter, which treated this property as a
host capability to be checked.

Commit f0ff4d51057080e769407e873e5ed212f15b773d caused the problem.

To fix this watchdog_action property is put into 'hw:' scope, so
that it will be ignored by ComputeCapabilitiesFilter in scheduler and
handled in libvirt driver. The doc must be fixed accordingly.

Now driver accepts both 'hw_watchdog_action' and
'hw:watchdog_action', tests were edited for these cases.
Were added TODO items to delete the compat code in L release.

Port binding failure is an error and should be reported as such.
Additionally, if a port binding fails on a host due to missing
bridge mappings, it's currently quite a mystery to find out. This
should be logged instead of requiring users to debug code. Not
everyone enjoys debugging Python, as weird as that is!

I refactored out the common code in check_segment_for_agent
in order to make logging more robust for all agent-based mechanism
drivers. The OVS and LB mech drivers already log due to a bridge
mappings mismatch and the other agent based mech drivers
will now log as well.

The script oslo_debug_helper enables the usage of Python's pdb without
having to do the tedious listing of test cases from testr and then
running it. Only thing that needs to be done now is the adding of
""import pdb; pdb.set_trace()"" as usual and then one can just call:

    $ tox -e debug

And we will end up in the debugger when that test is hit.

Note that you can also give a test_regex such as:

    $ tox -e debug -- some_test_regex

To run only tests that match that regex.

Due to unclear meanings of existing names for share drivers modes it was
decided to replace string driver modes with boolean value, since we have only
two possible values that will clearly say what it used for by name of opt.

This replacement includes following changes:
- String opt 'share_driver_mode' is replaced with
bool opt 'driver_handles_share_servers'. New bool opt does not have
default value and should be defined explicitly.
- Class ShareDriver (parent class for share drivers) now expects additional
argument 'driver_handles_share_servers' which is mandatory and should be
provided by child classes. Expected values are boolean or tuple/list/set of
booleans that says what modes are supported. Above new config opt will be
compared to these.
- Update interfaces 'setup_server' and 'teardown_server' of class ShareDriver.
These interfaces now consider driver modes and call new additional private
methods only when driver is enabled to mode with share servers handling.
These new private methods are '_setup_server' and '_teardown_server', they
should be redefined by child classes when share servers should be handled by
Manila.
- To get know current driver mode within child classes just call property
'driver_handles_share_servers'. It can not be changed by child classes and
returns value that is set by config opt with same name.
- Remove methods 'setup_server' and 'teardown_server' from all share drivers,
that do not support handling of share servers.
- Rename methods 'setup_server' and 'teardown_server' to appropriate
private methods for drivers that do support handling of share servers.
- Update unit tests related to all changed places.
- Make Devstack set new mandatory bool opt.

Cells prepend full cell path to the service ID before returning any
service related info. This means service ID is non numeric and can't
be cast into Service objects.  In cells, service_get_all method
in HostAPI (which is used to display list of services) strips out
the cell path from received IDs, creates Service objects using
remaining numerical ID and uses a ServiceProxy to associate cell paths
Service objects.
However, other service related methods do not do so. They include:
 - service_update (Used for enabling/disabling services)
 - service_get_all_by_host (Used for evacuation)
These functions try to cast received service info (with alphanumeric
service IDs) into Service objects and fail with a ValueError.
This leads to API cell throwing Error 500 for service-enable,
service-disable and evacuate.
This patch extends the ServiceProxy usage to both these methods. It
also changes the corresponding HostAPI tests.

Note: The required unit-tests are manually added to the below path,
as new path for unit-tests is not present in stable/juno release.

Report utility rewritten from scratch.

To publish data from one build use:

  ./report.py -j <job_name> -N <build_number>

To publish data from all jobs in a view:

  ./report.py --view <view>

Improvements:

- do not update data if it is already present in spreadsheet;
- use records, not columns, therefore do not reconfigure the whole table for every change;
- retry if failed (for views);
- add debug output;
- support changes in test groups set: if we add new test case, column
  will be added; if we remove test case, its column will be empty;
- support builds with no test results.

This changeset is an alternative to
I308316932801689b8cab63555907b0752779dd63 and is meant to reflect a
smaller set of changes that would encourage creating new projects and
teams without discarding the incubation process entirely. Most of the
discussion of changes to gate configuration is left out, since I believe
we can make those changes regardless of any other governance changes we
make.

requirements from the incubation and integration policies and suggestions
1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 from Monty's blog post [1].

When running a scenario that does not involve booting from volume, it is
important to avoid mapping the volume to be attached to the boot device.
vda is often a boot device. This uses vdrally which should never be

There may be a better way to do this by converting from
block_device_mapping to block_device_mapping_v2, where it is possible to
express a boot_index, but that's a more invasive change.

The object replicator checks each partition directory to ensure it's
really a directory and not a zero-byte file. This was happening in
collect_jobs(), which is the first thing that the object replicator
does.

The effect was that, at startup, the object-replicator process would
list each ""objects"" or ""objects-N"" directory on each object device,
then stat() every single thing in there. On devices with lots of
partitions on them, this makes the replicator take a long time before
it does anything useful.

If you have a cluster with a too-high part_power plus some failing
disks elsewhere, you can easily get thousands of partition directories
on each disk. If you've got 36 disks per node, that turns into a very
long wait for the object replicator to do anything. Worse yet, if you
add in a configuration management system that pushes new rings every
couple hours, the object replicator can spend the vast majority of its
time collecting jobs, then only spend a short time doing useful work
before the ring changes and it has to start all over again.

This commit moves the stat() call (os.path.isfile) to the loop that
processes jobs. In a complete pass, the total work done is about the
same, but the replicator starts doing useful work much sooner.

The dictionary field 'gw_port_host' was added for
DVR routers and is used by the scheduler and l3_agent
to schedule where the SNAT port for a DVR router
will be hosted.  In some code flows on the l3_agent,
this field is checked to determine what the agent
should do if the host matches its own or not.

Recently it has been seen that the router data sent
from the scheduler is missing this field in some cases.
This causes the agent to throw a KeyError and not function
properly.  This patch will make the l3_agent more robust
and less fragile by calling 'get' instead of assuming the
field will be there.

More work may be needed on the scheduler side to see why
this field is missing. That is why I am marking this as a
partial-fix for now. But this patch will make the l3_agent
less prone to errors and therefore an improvement.

This patch fixes an issue that occurs when a distributed
virtual router (DVR) is in use on a network and a user
attempts to assign a floating IP address to an instance.

The existing approach assumes that only standard routers,
not DVR based router(s), are in use on the network. As a
result, if you attempt to assign a floating IP address,
there are no candidate ports shown in the select to bind
the floating IP address to. The dialog that allows you
to attach a floating IP address will show a message in
the ""Port to be associated"" select of ""No ports available"".

This patch ensures that if a distributed router exists
for the network, the appropriate port for that router
is displayed in the list of ports.

If Network contains dhcpv6-stateful Subnet with prefix other than /64,
dnsmasq refuses to start if prefix-len is not specified in dhcp-range
option.  From dnsmasq(8) manpage:

    For IPv6, the parameters are slightly different: instead of netmask
    and broadcast address, there is an optional prefix length which must
    be equal to or larger then the prefix length on the local interface.
    If not given, this defaults to 64. Unlike the IPv4 case, the prefix
    length is not automatically derived from the interface
    configuration. The mimimum size of the prefix length is 64.

It is safe to always specify prefix length, so dnsmasq will use correct
configuration.

For DVR, FIPs should be hosted on the single node
which hosts the VM assigned with the fixed_ip of the FIP.
The l3_agent should only take action on the correct FIP per
host by filtering the FIPs based on the 'host' value
of the FIP.

A recent refactor on the l3_agent moved the host filtering logic
from process_router_floating_ip_addresses() to
_get_external_device_interface_name(). The local floating_ips var
was not altered as it was before the refactor.

This resulted in network disruption across multiple hosts
since more than one namespace contained the FIP.  This problem
would only be seen in a mutli-host environment where the same
router hosting FIPs was present on more than one node.

The fix is to return the host filtering logic by adding a
call to get_floating_ips().  In addition, the unit test
test_process_router_dist_floating_ip_add() was modified to
pass two FIPs instead of one.  One FIP matches the host
of the agent, one does not.  Only one should be processed,
not two.

When a L3 agent starts up the initial full sync occurs
on the first periodic task interval.
This means that from the point the agent is ready to
process updates it can take ~1 minute until traffic
can start flowing through the L3 agent's routers.

When using a highly available solution (not VRRP)
the startup delay adds around a full minute to
the minimum downtime.

This patch simply does a manual (i.e. not periodic) full
sync once the L3 agent is ready (in 'after_start' method).

The change results in a much faster sync on a new agent.
With the patch it takes several seconds until routers are
created on the new/restarted L3 agent.

The test_get_available_languages test assumes that
get_available_languages() has not been called prior to the test.
That is, it assumes that the global variable
_gettextutils._AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES does not already have a domain's
languages cached in it.  This causes problems if another test case
uses get_available_languages().  In order to properly isolate this
test case, it is updated to clear the cache prior to testing.

Concurrent VIM API invocations after session expiration would result
in concurrent login attempts. In such cases, if a login attempt is
made after a successful one, it would result in InvalidLogin. This
is because vCenter server won't allow login within an active session.
On the other hand, if two or more login attempts reach vCenter at
the same, it would result in session leak-- the last one returned
overwrite any of the previous sessions. This patch prevents the
race condition by making session creation synchronized and checking
for an active session before login attempt. We can also remove the
call to terminate previous session after login since a login is
attempted only if there is no active session.

This patch adds a neutronv2 driver. This driver allows one to write policy
against neutron and exposes an improved schema from the first version of the
driver (i.e no more subtables). This patch also exposes security-group-rules
from neutron which were not exposed in the previous driver.

Note: This patch does not remove the original datasource driver. I plan to
remove this in a follow up patchset. The reason why I didn't remove it in this
one is that test_congress uses the neutron datasource driver for several of
its tests.

A manager for the ebtables utility. Due to many similarities
between an ebtables and iptables manager a lot of the shared
code has been factored out into a base_table_manager module.

This is just a start, with time there are more similarities
that can be factored out into that new module.

The implementation of the ebtables manager comes in large
part from an abandoned patch provided by Édouard Thuleau, which
he presented for review here:

Credit for the workin of the ebtables manager should go to

The addition of the metadata agent cache backend improved metadata
performance if the cache_url config option is set, however it regressed
the non-cached performance significantly.
See commit: ""Metadata agent caches networks for routers"".  This is
fixed by reducing the number of calls to client.Client() in
_get_neutron_client().

When trying to create a troveclient.v1.client.Client without specifying
endpoint_type explicitly it will raise an AuthorizationFailure exception.
This was because troveclient.v1.client.Client defaulted endpoint_type=None
which overrides the troveclient.client.HTTPClient default value of 'publicURL'
to None. Fix was to default the endpoint_type to 'publicURL' in the
troveclient.v1.client.Client __init__ method.

Also updated the documentation and README.rst for creating a

Garbage volume remained when an attached NFS volume was migrated

This commit creates them as simple sub-classes and instantiates them
when appropriate.  It also moves the basic mixin classes from
RouterInfo.  Since all of the properties and attributes from these
mixins are only used in the ha or dvr contexts, this is safe.  Future
refactoring will further tease things out until they are properly
encapsulated.

They inherit everything else from their base class so that they all
still share the same code.  Creating them up front provides a place
for dvr and ha specific logic to land as methods are moved from the L3
agent and mixins to the new router classes.  Eventually, all of the
specific logic will be teased in to the specific classes.

While there is a dependency between assignment and identity with
regard to config settings, it isn't a circular one.  Correct the
comment and move it closer to the code in question.

This is the part of the more comprehensive split of
assignments, which rationalizes both the backend and controllers.
In order to make this change easier for reviewers, it is divided
into a number of smaller patches.

Previous patches have:

- Moved role management into its own manager and drivers
- Fixed incorrect doc strings for grant driver methods
- Updated controllers to call the new role manager
- Updated unit tests to call the new role manager

This patch refactors the assignment manager and driver methods
to logically separate the project/domain functionality from
that of the actual assignments in preparation for the move of
projects/domains to their own backend. This patch should not
cause any functional change.

Future patches will:

- Split projects and domains into their own manager/backend
- Update the assignment controller to call the new manager
- Update the tests to call the new manager
- Split the assignment controller, giving projects/domains
  their own controller

Partially implements: bp pluggable-assignments

Presently, the wsgi server allows persist connections. Hence even after
the response is sent to the client, it doesn't close the client socket
connection. Because of this problem, the green thread is not released
back to the pool.

In order to close the client socket connection explicitly after the
response is sent and read successfully by the client, you simply have to
set keepalive to False when you create a wsgi server.

Added a parameter to take advantage of the new(ish) eventlet socket timeout
behaviour. Allows closing idle client connections after a period of time, eg:

$ time nc localhost 8776
real    1m0.063s

Setting 'client_socket_timeout = 0' means do not timeout.

DocImpact:
Added wsgi_keep_alive option (default=True).
Added client_socket_timeout option (default=900).

SecurityImpact

A tool to allow pseudo translations to be created in order to identify
potential translation problems. To use the tool:
Make sure your English file is up to date:
./run_tests.sh --makemessages

Run the pseudo tool to create pseudo translations:
./run_tests.sh --pseudo de

Compile the catalog:
./run_tests.sh --compilemessages

Run your dev server. Log in and change to the language you pseudo translated.
It should look weird. More specifically, every translatable string is going
to start and end with a bracket and they are going to have some added
characters. For example, ""Log In"" will become ""[~Log In~您好яшçあ]""
This is useful because you can inspect for the following:
- If you see a string in English it's not translatable. Should it be?
- If you see brackets next to each other that might be concatenation.
- If there is unexpected wrapping/truncation there might not be enough
  space for translations
- If you see a string in the proper translated language, it comes from an
  external source. (That's not bad, just sometimes useful to know)
- If you get new crashes, there is probably a bug. :-)

This is intended to work around a race condition where cloud-init looks
for ssh keys on the state partition before it has loaded the state
partition. Since it only finds an empty directory, it goes ahead and
creates new keys, which is undesirable.

This change will restore the keys from /mnt/state when os-refresh-config
is run.
