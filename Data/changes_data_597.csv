This patch is trying to highlight and build a shared understanding of some
problems by making a statement of intent around the need to be globally
inclusive when we make decisions.

The aim is to ensure we do not accidentally make things worse as we evolve,
and hopefully encourage folks with ideas to step forward and help improve
on what we have today.

As part on ensuring good communication in a global community, we must be
mindful of how using synchronous communication (be it IRC meetings or in
person meetings) can exclude many in our community from being involved,
which is contrary to the four opens.

This is largely inspired by a conversation in the SWG room about sharing
best practices around globally inclusive decision making. It is indented
to be about the whole OpenStack community, not just the TC.

With microversion < 2.34, the API casts to the migrate_server
method in super conductor which targets the context using the
@targets_cell decorator.

With microversion >= 2.34, the API casts to the live_migrate_instance
method in super conductor which does not use the @targets_cell
decorator, which results in a failure to lookup the instance action
record when recording the start of the action event with the
@wrap_instance_event decorator.

This change simply adds the decorator and provides a test which
was missing for this before. Note that the live migration CI job
didn't catch this regression since it only tests up to microversion
2.26.

This reverts commit a7e9a5d447b3eeacfb52d7ddc94445058a8d6fd1.

The jobs that run live migration tests are failing at about
a rate of 50% since this merged. There are no recent changes
to nova in the last 24 hours that are related to live
migration, and this is failing on the master branch only,
so I suspect the failures are due to new qemu packages
getting pulled in from this change.

When we add a resource to a template using add_resource(), strip any
references to resources that are not present in the template from
'depends_on'. This means that resources that are present and depended on
but conditionally disabled in the source template will not be depended
on in the destination template, where they're not present at all (and
thus would cause errors when the template is used).

Since we retired most branches <= mitaka, we can remove some unused jobs
and regex.

Also, do not use python-jobs-trusty template for fuel-web since the docs
job is not desired.

We wish to remove the global ""run mitaka branch on trusty"" regexes
(see Ic4fe6e70dc0704845b357cb3bc95d42615c28bf3) to simplify zuulv3
transitions.  The branch is due for EOL but the following have
requested their branches remain

 - openstack/group-based-policy
 - openstack/group-based-policy-automation
 - openstack/group-based-policy-ui
 - openstack/python-group-based-policy-client
 - openstack/networking-bigswitch

Thus we just want to keep this filter logic for these projects.

I believe these two new specific regexes should accurately match all
the jobs for group-based-policy-* and networking-bigswitch-* such that
we can remove the global filters after EOL-ing the mitaka branch.

PCI devices can be labeled with arbitrary tags with the help of
the passthrough_whitelist config option.

The passthrough_whitelist could be used several times in nova.conf such
way, it forms pools of PCI devices labeled with tags.

Same tags could be mentioned in pci_request.spec so when compute makes a claim
and consume_requests it also selects PCI devices from pools
matching PCI devices tags and pci_request.spec.

One of the cases mentioned in spec illustrates desired behavior.
For example, we need to get network PCI devices connected to
different switch and human request for that could be:
give me two PCI devices with the distinct tag ""switch"" for each device.

This patch does the following:
- preliminary finds distinct values for chosen tags,
- modifies PCI request such way each contains the distinct value for chosen
  tags in spec.

It's a possible situation when we can delete
allocated pci device e.g. if pci.passthrough_whitelist is changed.
If we restore whitelist then a new pci device will be created
and discrepancy appears: it's allocated in hypervisor context
but it's free in nova context.

This patch reads deleted pci_device records and updates
fields for a new pci device record if it's needed.

This patch optimizes the Erlang/RabbitMQ installation on CentOS. It
includes:

  * Installing RabbitMQ from RabbitMQ's repository
  * Installing Erlang all-in-one from RabbitMQ's repository
  * Remove old versionlocks before applying new ones (fixes bug)

The erlang-solutions repository is hosted in eastern Europe and has
high latency to the USA and western Europe. Installing from that
repository brings in over 80 individual packages, which causes
additional delays in the role.

The Erlang all-in-one package from RabbitMQ's repository contains
only the Erlang bits that RabbitMQ needs. Also, it has HiPE enabled
by default, which is recommended by RabbitMQ developers for
better performance.

The openSUSE OBS OpenStack repositories provide rabbitmq-server and
erlang packages tested in an openSUSE OpenStack cloud environment so
it's best to use these instead of upstream ones. As such we change the
default option to be 'distro' instead of 'file'. However, for the tests
we use 'file' so we can install an older version and test the upgrade
path. Moreover, we drop the 'zypper lock' code since the OBS repositories
only provide one version of the needed packages. Finally, we fail if the
installation method is set to external since there is no upstream
repositoiry for openSUSE.

In I77650be5f04775a72e2bdf694f93988825a84b72 we added
vnic_type direct to the ovs mechanism drivers supported
vnic_types. This cause problems when working with ovs and sriovnicswitch
mechanism drivers in that order.  In this case the ovs will bind
the direct port instead of the sriovnicswitch.

This change make ovs mech driver to bind the direct port only
if user requested --binding-profile '{""capabilities"": [""switchdev""]}'
in the direct port if a user don't request this capability the SR-IOV
legacy NIC mode is used.

When enable-sriov-nic-features will be implemented in nova and
libvirt will expose the switchdev capability then nova will be
able to select a host which supports SR-IOV nic with switchdev
mode.

approach. This yml files can destroy and create the VM's relatively
faster than the quickstart.yml.

The Pike UCA repo has been bumped to include the recently released
Ceph LTS, Luminous (12.x). Since the UCA repo is installed almost
globally in our deployment, this creates package conflicts when we
attempt to deploy the former Ceph LTS, Jewel (10.x) releases.

We will bump our Ceph stable release to the Luminous release for Pike
and later to avoid the package conflicts with UCA.

This also adds the ceph-mgr role execution since the ceph-mgr service
is required in Luminous. See http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/mgr/ for
more information.

Note this backport also includes a bump of the ceph-anisble roles to
v2.3.0rc5 since it includes a required package list fix for Luminous.

This patch does quite a few things to improve the performance of the
CentOS tasks:

1) Configures RDO repos as repositories rather than reinstalling an
   RPM each time.
2) GPG keys are only installed if they're needed.
3) Yum repo configs are carefully modified if they already exist
   which avoids removing deployer configurations.
4) Repo priorities are now set in one shot.

Report ready status for node means successful node status
which can be get if all tasks was passed with ready and skipped
statuses.

Same effect can be get if Astute mark node as skipped. In this
case we also get equal status 'successful'.

So we need ask node about skipped statuses before ask it about
successful status to prevent losing context about stop
deployment operation.

How to reproduce the bug:

P.S. Using the horizon master(pike) codebase

1) Login as an admin user
2) Click Identity and go to the Users panel
3) Create a user and put an email address with that user
4) Then edit this user to clear the email address.
5) Update the user and even though we have a green  banner(successful)
show up, the email address still viewable and do not disappear.

When the proxy times out talking to a backend server (say, because it
was under heavy load and having trouble servicing the request), we catch
the ChunkReadTimeout and try to get the rest from another server. The
client by and large doesn't care; there may be a brief pause in the
download while the proxy get the new connection, but all the bytes
arrive and in the right order:

    GET from node1, serve bytes 0 through N, timeout
    GET from node2, serve bytes N through end

When we calculate the range for the new request, we check to see if we
already have one from the previous request -- if one exists, we adjust
it based on the bytes sent to the client thus far. This works fine for
single failures, but if we need to go back *again* we double up the
offset and send the client incomplete, bad data:

    GET from node1, serve bytes 0 through N, timeout
    GET from node2, serve bytes N through M, timeout
    GET from node3, serve bytes N + M through end

Leaving the client missing bytes M through N + M.

We should adjust the range based on the number of bytes pulled from the
*backend* rather than delivered to the *frontend*. This just requires
that we reset our book-keeping after adjusting the Range header.

nova-manage can output a warning message in some cases (see [1] for
an example with the latest oslo.db), and that confuses the nova_manage
provider.

Since the command in a provider cannot separate stdout and stderr[2],
we use a workaround with Puppet::Util::Execution.execute, and
use that instead of the provider command in the nova_cells and
nova_cell_v2 providers.

Make some json -> (text, xml) stuff in a common module, reference that in
account/container servers so we don't break existing clients (including
out-of-date proxies), but have the proxy controllers always force a json
listing.

This simplifies operations on listings (such as the ones already happening in
decrypter, or the ones planned for symlink and sharding) by only needing to
consider a single response type.

There is a downside of larger backend requests for text/plain listings, but
it seems like a net win?

This commit improves test coverage for flavor_access policies, achieving
the the most amount of coverage in Patrole for these policies that is
currently possible.

The base policy ""os_compute_api:os-flavor-access"" is covered by
4 separate APIs, but currently Patrole only tests 1 one of those
APIs. This commit extends the existing tests to achieve almost
full test coverage, with the exception of this endpoint:

    POST /flavors

At present, it is impossible to test os-flavor-access for that
endpoint since it also enforces os-flavor-manage:create
(or os-flavor-manage) both of which require admin.

In addition, this commit fixes test_show_flavor always passing.
While policy enforcement happens in Nova when calling
`self.flavors_client.show_flavor`, no Forbidden exception
is raised following failure. Instead, the attribute
""os-flavor-access:is_public"" is injected into the response
body following successful policy enforcement. So Patrole
checks for the attribute and, if not found, raises an
appropriate RbacMalformedResponse exception.

Fix a usage regression, use case #2 in Nova Neutron Routed Networks spec
https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/newton/implemented/neutron-routed-networks.html

Currently ip allocation is always deferred if binding:host_id is not
specified when routed networks are used. This causes initial fixed-ips
data provided by the user to be _lost_ unless the user also specify the
host.

Since the user specified the IP or Subnet to allocate in, there is no
reason to defer the allocation.

a) It is a common pattern, especially in Heat templates to:
 1. Create a port with fixed-ips specifying a subnet.
 2. Create a server and associate the existing port.
b) It is also common to use Neutron IPAM as a source to get VIP
   addresses for clusters on provider networks.

This change enables these use cases with routed networks.

DocImpact: ""The Networking service defers assignment of IP addresses to
the port until the particular compute node becomes apparent."" This is no
longer true if fixed-ips is used in the port create request.

During segmented (chunked) uploads of large files to Swift, if a
single segment fails to upload, Glance will abort the entire
upload, which could have been in progress for many hours.
However, if seek() and tell() methods are provided on the input
file stream, swiftclient will attempt to reset the filestream
back to the beginning of the segment and retry.
This patch adds glance_store._drivers.swift.buffered.BufferedReader to
provide this reset capability.  It works by buffering the segment/chunk
to disk in case an upload error occurs and a reset is required.  This
could potentially use much larger disk space, so a CONF setting,
CONF.glance_store.swift_store_reader_class is required to
enable the new reader.  (The default is to use the existing
glance_store._drivers.swift.store.ChunkReader.)
This patch does not address the automatic revert to ChunkReader if
we run out of space for buffering.

Various people have requested a suite of gabbi tests that present
the entire request and response bodies for all the resources in the
placement API. fullrep.yaml adds tests for every GET, POST and PUT
method that the API presents. DELETE is not included because no
bodies are involved.

In some cases the results can be quite illuminating with regard to
lack of symmetry or other inconsistencies. In other cases,
especially where the response is either unordered or not a pure dict
it is hard to represent the response in a comprehensible form that
also works as a response_json_paths value.

The hope is that this can be used as a starting point for future
work that improves the representations, creates documentation or
otherwise makes the placement API better.

TODO: When some pending code merges the inventory tests will no
longer be correct and will need to be updated.

When neutron trunk extension is not enabled, we cannot retrieve
network ports for a new instance. The current version of
port_list_with_trunk_types assumes the trunk extension is always
available, so if it is not enabled we cannot retrieve network ports.
This commit changes the logic to check whether the trunk extension
is enabled and if not it does not retrieve trunk information.

Currently max_version field shows text as
""Deprecated in version %s"" which seems confusing to show
deprecated fields vs removed fields.

For example: if any element is removed in x version, then we
tag that element in parameter.yaml with max_version: x-1. api-ref shows
that element as ""Deprecated in version x-1"" which seems confusing on
below interpretation:
- is that element deprecated in x-1 version?
- is that element only deprecated in x-1 version not removed?

But actually that element is removed in x and only available till x-1 version.

- https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/?expanded=evacuate-server-evacuate-action-detail

The innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit flag changes the timing
of when the log buffer is written to disk for writes.
At its default of 1, transactions are written to disk
and the buffer flushed on a per-transaction basis; but when
set to 2, the flush of the buffer proceeds only once per
second.  This removes the durability guarantee for the
single node.  However the central concept of Galera is
that durability is achieved via the cluster as a whole,
in that transactions are replicated to other nodes before
the commit succeeds (though not necessarily written to disk
unless wsrep_causal_reads is set).  In this model,
data would only be lost of all nodes of the Galera cluster
were killed within one second of each other.  Percona's
blog post at https://www.percona.com/blog/2014/11/17/typical-misconceptions-on-galera-for-mysql/
recommends that the value of 2 should be considered ""safe""
for a Galera cluster unless you are in fact worried that
all three nodes will be powered off simultaneously.

The value here is added as an option only, defaulting
to the usual default of ""1"", flush per transaction.

This commit adds missing v3 volume tests for which corresponding

This commit is necessary for partially deprecating the v2 volume
RBAC tests -- but before that can be done, we need to ensure
that v3 has at least the exact same coverage v2 does, plus
additional coverage for v3 APIs.

This commit specifically adds v3 tests for:
  - test_qos_rbac
  - test_volume_basic_crud_rbac
  - test_volume_hosts_rbac
  - test_volume_metadata_rbac

This commit also adds a missing RBAC test for showing a volume

the instance was never actually evacuated to another host.

Currently before running the openstack undercloud upgrade
command there are required steps in order for it to work:

sudo systemctl stop 'openstack-*'
sudo systemctl stop 'neutron-*'
sudo systemctl stop 'openvswitch'
sudo systemctl stop 'httpd'

Since these are manual and error prone

should avoid them and require to only run
'openstack undercloud upgrade' for upgrading the undercloud.

ceph-ansible has undergone significant refactoring in their v3
development, adding new required roles such as ceph-defaults and
ceph-config, which are used to provide vars and configuration to
the ceph service roles. These roles must be executed before the
service roles to avoid missing vars[1][2].

During the v3 refactoring, ceph-common was removed as a galaxy-style
role dependency in the service roles meta files[3]. This means we
will need to explicitly execute ceph-common from now on also.

This change adds the defaults and config roles and executes them.
Also some minor cleanup such as alphabetizing the OpenStack roles
list is done.

Also added is an upgrade playbook, reno, and docs to assist in
cleaning up the older galaxy-named ceph common roles which are
no longer galaxy namespaced in our cloning configuration.

Getting all hosts returns every Cinder service host, regardless
of which service is running on the host. But getting a specific
host will fail if you try it for a host not running cinder-volume.

This looks to be the behavior from the beginning, but there was
nothing denoting this, causing errors and confusion for code that
thought it could get a host from the list, then get detailed info
about that host. The details return volume and snapshot counts,
so it really only makes sense for cinder-volume, so the code ends
up returning a 404 for anything else.

This API design seems a little disjointed, but since this is how
it appears to have always been, just make sure the api docs have

This would set the global_request_id instead of the request_id. Long
term it would be nice to get glance using oslo's request_id

This proposal is the result of some conversation in TC office
hours[1] in which I suggested that we need to address code
complexity if we want to keep the contributors that we attract by
lowering the barriers to entry.

As it currently stand it lays out the problem, but does not
express well how help is to be applied, input appreciated (which,
once had, I'll adjust this commit message). We've been talking
about tech debt as a problem for years, and made some progress
here and there, but rarely does it address the simple problem of
""wow, this code is really hard to read"".

Readability is fundamental to retaining new contributors. So,
please help getting this to a useful state.

it's not needed and conflicts with the generation of the user-specific

This allows decoupling the Swift ringbuilding logic from the Controller
and ObjectStorage roles. A follow up patch will modify
tripleo-heat-templates and use this modified class.

Actually this downloads the Swift rings even if ring building is
disabled or if there is no need to rebalance. This is required, because
operators can disable ring building, but use the same mechanism to
distribute pre-built rings to the nodes.

If ring building is disabled, these won't be uploaded at the end back to
the undercloud.

Newer deployments are using versionless Keystone endpoints, and most
OpenStack clients already support this.

This patch enables this for Swift: if an auth_url without any path
component is found, it assumes a versionless endpoint will be used.
In this case the v3 suffix will be appended to the path if none
auth_version is set, and v2.0 is appended if auth_version requires v2.
