In functional tests of the ovsdb_monitor, sometimes during high load
of the host where tests are run, ""error"" message from the killed process
can be received by neutron's async_process after new process was
already spawned.
And that causes failure of the test as new ovsdb_monitor will not
receive events which are expected.

To workaround that issue this patch adds sleep for few seconds between
stopping old and starting new ovsdb_monitor process.

In a replicated scenario it is possible for an R2 volume to be larger
than its paired R1 if we do not force a new volume creation on both
sides of the pair.  While using existing volumes is more efficient it
throws an exception if we want to extend the R1 to a size that is less
than or equal to the R2.

To fix this we are setting the create_new_volumes flag to true for
all replicated volumes.  It will remain false for non replicated volumes.

The need for this change stems from following issues:
1) When ovs_use_veth = False with ovs-dpdk issue with ovs
was observed - after vswitch restart interface is not comming up.
Meaning ovs-dpdk uses ovs internal ports and it is not able to bring
them up on restart.
2) When ovs_use_veth = True and ovs-dpkd is used, packets sent with
incorrect checksum due to the fact that ovs-dpdk does not do checksum
calculations for veth interface.

This commit allows to use second option and resolve checksum issue by
disabling checksum offload.

Now that we're starting to set scope_types on default policies, we
should make sure we handle InvalidScope exceptions from oslo.policy in
the event enforce_scope=True. Operators won't use this switch for a
while, but it prepares us for when cinder will be system-scope aware.

This commit also bumps the minimum version of oslo.policy to 3.6.2,
which is safer when running tests in parallel with different
policy configurations.

When running fetch with become, the slurp module will also
be used to fetch the contents of the file for determining
the remote checksum. This effectively doubles the transfer
size [0] and shows up as a MemoryError when the file size
is large enough.

In TripleO this is problematic in large & old deployments
when transferring the /var/lib/mysql folder.

This patch switches to using rsync directly between the src
and dst hosts to transfer the data. This is advantageous not
only for solving the above-mentioned bug, but is also faster.

A simpler implementation using synchronize was attempted [1],
but there were issues with the mistral container which
prevented that approach from being successful.

When a tripleo major upgrade or FFU causes an update or mariadb
to a new major version (e.g. 10.1 -> 10.3), some internal DB
tables must be upgraded (myisam tables), and sometimes the
existing user tables may be migrated to new mariadb defaults.

Move the db-specific upgrade steps into a dedicated script and
make sure that it is called at the right time while upgrading
the undercloud and/or the overcloud.

Challenge:
Now remote_ks_admin and remote_rgw_user are using for user labels
of backup target openstack cloud.
When the backup user doesn't exist and we can enable job_ks_user
manifest.
But job_ks_user uses .Vaules.secrets.identity.admin and mariadb,
while secret-rgw and cron-job-backup-mariadb use .Values.secrets.
identity.remote_ks_admin and remote_rgw_user.
It requires to use same values for admin and remote_ks_admin,
and for mariadb and remote_rgw_user.
Seems it isbreaking values consistency.

Suggestion:
Now providing 2 kinds of backup - pvc and swift.
""remote_"" means the swift backup.
In fact, mariadb chart has no case to access to keystone except
swift backup. So we can remove remote_xx_* prefix and there is
no confusion.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

1. Sets ""is_stream_node""=false
2. If os is stream it overwrites ""is_stream_node"" to true

The current driver is podman which creates problems when we
try to use the synchronize module for the file copy between

delegated driver and two inventory hosts (which are localhost)
instead which is more efficient, more portable and opens more
options.

We also add 'any_errors_fatal: true' to the play
arguments to ensure that any error stops the whole test.

The converge playbook is targeted at localhost, rather than
all instances, because that is the way that the role being
tested is used in TripleO.

Similar to I6f01a178616b74ed9a86876ca46e7e46eb360518, this patch
fixes a compatibility issue when the new connection properties
dictionary exists, but is missing the 'failed_over' field. This
situation may arise when booting a shelved instance whose connection
properties were created prior to when the ScaleIO driver was enhanced
to support replication failover.

This patch changes the slot selection logic to look for more than one
token label in the list of slots, using the first token that is found.

This change is required to enable load balancing with devices that
use separate tokens for this feature.

This patch adds a new option in the [p11_crypto_plugin] section
""token_labels"", and deprecates the ""token_label"" option.

For backwards compatibility, the ""token_label"" option will still be used
if present.

Add posibilities to configure ovn dbs monitor interval
in tht by OVNDBSPacemakerMonitorInterval (default 30s).
Under load, this can create extra stress and since the
timeout has already been bumped, it makes sense to bump
this interval to a higher value as a trade off
between detecting a failure and stressing the service.

Tempest starts the testing of keystone system scope
feature which is available since Queens. Nova has added
the scope support in their policies in Ussuri[1].

To enable the system scope testing on Tempest, we need to set:
- tempest.auth.admin_system to 'all'
- and option to set the service based oslo_policy.enforce_scope flag

The current network.dashboard.ingress.annotations in horizon/values.yaml do not include the kubernetes property 'proxy-body-size'. This makes the resulting nginx.conf file in ingress add the default rule 'max_body_size 1m' to the horizon servers, which limits all http requests' size inside horizon to 1MB, making it impossible to upload images larger than that to glance using the horizon GUI, for example.

This change adds said property to horizon/values.yaml, making horizon's servers in nginx.conf include a 'max_body_size' of 0 (unlimited), which makes the image upload feature usable again.

In change I03febf6ad7d76c7eec818d3b16a3ef8b26dcd84c we introduced a mock
of nova.virt.libvirt.utils.get_arch' to the 'FakeLibvirtFixture'. This
was a follow-up to change Icf55488e61793d5b055d230c8524df8210cd00fd
which introduced this mock for many individual libvirt-related tests. In
change I458b1db091e33c0b835e44b5a86de6c0a08f99a3, we decided to poison
'os.uname' rather than 'get_arch' since that was the underlying cause of
test differences, but we never extended this reasoning to the existing
mocks of 'get_arch'. The mocking of 'get_arch' is now a hindrance to any
test that wants to validate behavior where the architecture requested
via image metadata (the 'hw_architecture' property) differs from the
host architecture, so it is time to make this switch and stop mocking
'get_arch' (almost) entirely.

When a load balancer failover was performed on a load balancer where
the VIP address is on a subnet that has no IP addresses available,
the VIP address may be deactivated.
This patch corrects the failover flow to not deallocate the VIP
address on a failover revert flow due to the subnet being out of
IP addresses.

This patch implements the project scoped rbac policies for a
system and project scoped deployment of ironic. Because of the
nature of Ports and Portgroups, along with the subcontroller
resources, this change was a little more invasive than was
originally anticipated. In that process, along with some
discussion in the #openstack-ironic IRC channel, that it
would be most security concious to respond only with 404s if
the user simply does not have access to the underlying node
object.

In essence, their view of the universe has been restricted as
they have less acess rights, and we appropriately enforce that.
Not expecting that, or not conciously being aware of that, can
quickly lead to confusion though. Possibly a day or more of
Julia's life as well, but it comes down to perceptions and
awareness.

There are some Ironic execution workflows where there is not an easy way
to retry, such as when attempting to hand off the processing of an async
task to a conductor. Task handoff can require releasing a lock on the
node, so the next entity processing the task can acquire the lock
itself. However, this is vulnerable to race conditions, as there is no
uniform retry mechanism built in to such handoffs. Consider the
continue_node_deploy/clean logic, which does this:

  method = 'continue_node_%s' % operation
  # Need to release the lock to let the conductor take it
  task.release_resources()
  getattr(rpc, method)(task.context, uuid, topic=topic

If another process obtains a lock between the releasing of resources and
the acquiring of the lock during the continue_node_* operation, and
holds the lock longer than the max attempt * interval window (which
defaults to 3 seconds), then the handoff will never complete. Beyond
that, because there is no proper queue for processes waiting on the
lock, there is no fairness, so it's also possible that instead of one
long lock being held, the lock is obtained and held for a short window
several times by other competing processes.

This manifests as nodes occasionally getting stuck in the ""DEPLOYING""
state during a deploy. For example, a user may attempt to open or access
the serial console before the deploy is complete--the serial console
process obtains a lock and starves the conductor of the lock, so the
conductor cannot finish the deploy. It's also possible a long heartbeat
or badly-timed sequence of heartbeats could do the same.

To fix this, this commit introduces the concept of a ""patient"" lock,
which will retry indefinitely until it doesn't encounter the NodeLocked
exception. This overrides any retry behavior.

  .. note::
     There may be other cases where such a lock is desired.

Change I4d3193d8401614311010ed0e055fcb3aaeeebaed added some
additional local delete cleanup to prevent leaking of placement
allocations. The change introduced a regression in our ""delete while
booting"" handling as the _local_delete_cleanup required a valid
instance object to do its work and in two cases, we could have
instance = None from _lookup_instance if we are racing with a create
request and the conductor has deleted the instance record while we
are in the middle of processing the delete request.

This handles those scenarios by doing two things:

  (1) Changing the _local_delete_cleanup and
      _update_queued_for_deletion methods to take an instance UUID
      instead of a full instance object as they really only need the
      UUID to do their work
  (2) Saving a copy of the instance UUID before doing another instance
      lookup which might return None and passing that UUID to the
      _local_delete_cleanup and _update_queued_for_deletion methods

This ability to selectively disable CPU flags lets you avoid any CPU
flags that need to be disabled for any number of reasons.  E.g. disable
a CPU flag that is a potential security risk, or disable one that causes
a performance penalty.

This commit allows to set nf_conntrack_buckets in the initial namespace,

The patch https://review.opendev.org/#/c/673389/ introduced a regression
by changing the osc-lib interface.

Two conflicting attempts to fix the regression were launched:

1) Reverting the patch.

2) The patch https://review.opendev.org/683119 changes the exception
   from the generic CommandError back to a specific Forbidden exception.

   The patch https://review.opendev.org/683118 catches this exception
   and passes on, i.e. re-implements the same behavior as before.

The first idea was implemented, the initial patch reverted. The second
idea was partially implemented. The change in python-openstackclient
(683118) was merged. The change in osc-lib was approved but failed to
merge because the initial change had been reverted.

Now we have again a situation where the exception produced in osc-lib
does not match the exception expected by the caller.

It is unclear if the osc-lib interface will ever get a rebased version
of https://review.opendev.org/683119 merged, so the safest way to
address the issue is to also catch the exception that used to be
thrown before the inital change and is again thrown after the inital
change has been reverted.

According to [1], the NUMA nodes used should be chosen randomly. However, the
numa_fit_instance_to_host documentation mentions that it returns a new
InstanceNUMATopology with its cell ids set to host cell ids of the first successful
permutation or None, which means that the NUMA node 0 will be filled up, and
then instances will start getting scheduled on NUMA node 1.

This can result in a problematic imbalance on the compute nodes, and could generate
problems for live migrations, as the instances are live migrated to the same NUMA node
on a different node.

This adds a unit test that illustrates the NUMA node imbalance.

DVR does the ARP table update through the control plane, and does not
allow any ARP requests to get out of the node.

In order to address the allowed address pair VRRP IP issue with DVR,
we need to add an ARP entry into the ARP Responder table for the
allowed address pair IP ( which is taken care by the patch in [1])

This patch adds a rule in the br-int to redirect the packet
destinated to the router to the actual router-port and also moves
the arp filtering rule to the tunnel or the physical port based on the
configuration.

By adding the above rule it allows the ARP requests to reach the
ARP Responder table and filters the ARP requests before it reaches
the physical network or the tunnel.

As reported in LP#1896734, there is a limit in the size of information
that can be transmitted in one single message between an application
and the privsep daemon. The read socket buffer is limited in size;
a message exceeding this size will generate an exception.

In order to limit the amount of information to be sent, this patch
improves the performance of ""get_devices_with_ip"". In the previous
implementation, the whole list of network devices from a namespace
was retrieved. In some environments, the list of devices could be
so big that the list returned by ""privileged.get_link_devices"" can
exceed the read buffer size (as reported in the LP bug when the
OVS agent tries to retrieve the list of IP addresses in the system).

Now the function calls ""privileged.get_ip_addresses"", that returns
a much smaller list. This patch is also reducing the number of system
calls to just one; the previous implementation was retrieving first
the devices link information list (that method was returning a much
bigger blob) and then, per device, retrieving the IP address
information.

During reviewing https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/772603,
we noticed that a method decorated by create_mocks is called multiple time
in a single test. Previously create_mocks decorator does not stop mocking,
so this means that multiple active mock can exist for one method.
In general, it is not a good idea to mock a method multiple times at the
same time.

To cope with this situation, this commit ensures for create_mocks decorator
to stop active mocks when exiting the decorator.

This works for most cases, but it does not work only when mocking and
assertions are handled by separate methods and test logic is placed between
them. To cope with this, ""stop_mock"" optional argument is introduced.

FYI: Details on why ""stop_mock"" is needed.
I explored various ways but could not find a good way so far.
create_mocks needs to be a decorator as it needs to refer an object
reference (self). On the other hand, if we would like to merge the logic of
mocking and assertions (for example, _stub_api_calls() and _check_api_calls()
in openstack_dashboard/dashboards/project/overview/tests.py), a context
manager would be good as we would like to call it inside a class.
However, we cannot mix a decorator and a context manger as a decorator is
executed when a context manager is iniitialized and stopping mock in
the create_mocks decorator is done during the initialization of the
context manager and methods are not mocked when test code is run.

API microversion 2.25 introduced the 'block_migration=auto' value for
the os-migrateLive server action. This is a sensible default that we
should use, allowing users to avoid stating one of the
'--block-migration' or '--shared-migration' parameters explicitly.

While we're here, we take the opportunity to fix up some formatting in
the function, which is really rather messy.

One of the last big gaps with novaclient. As noted in the release note,
the current '--block-device-mapping' format is based on the old BDM v1
format, even though it actually results in BDM v2-style requests to the

Upstream get-pip.sh recently introduced a regression where it does not
work well with Python <=3.5. DIB, upper-constrained at version 2.35.0 in
requirements/upper-constraints.txt, wants to install pip with Python 2,
and that fails with with error message:

  ""ERROR: This script does not work on Python 2.7 The minimum supported
   Python version is 3.6.""

See attached story for more logging.

To work-around this issue on stable/ussuri, we have to make a
compromise: build amphora images using a >= 3.x DIB version. We could
either pick a 3.x DIB released version or Git master branch. For
consistency with what was done in stable/stein and stable/train
not so long ago, we propose Git master branch.

This is the host or ""domain capabilities"" side of the config changes.
Extend the 'LibvirtConfigDomainCaps' class to parse the 'firmware' enum
and 'loader' element from the 'os' element [1]:

  <os supported='yes'>
    <enum name='firmware'>
      <value>efi</value>
    </enum>
    <loader supported='yes'>
      <value>/usr/share/edk2/ovmf/OVMF_CODE.fd</value>
      <value>/usr/share/edk2/ovmf/OVMF_CODE.secboot.fd</value
      <enum name='type'>
        <value>rom</value>
        <value>pflash</value>
      </enum>
      <enum name='readonly'>
        <value>yes</value>
        <value>no</value>
      </enum>
      <enum name='secure'>
        <value>yes</value>
        <value>no</value>
      </enum>
    </loader>
  </os>

This gives us two important features. Firstly, the various enums in the
'loader' element give us information about the various guest bootloader
features supported by the host. This will allow us to detect, for
example, UEFI support in a much more robust manner than what nova does
today, namely probing the firmware binary paths via '_has_uefi_support'
in 'nova.virt.libvirt.driver'.

In addition, the presence of 'efi' in the 'firmware' enum can tells us
if libvirt supports the firmware auto-selection feature (as advertised
by libvirt 5.3 or above [2]). Using this, as we'll do later, allows to
reduce a typical guest bootloader config from something like:

  <os>
    <type arch='x86_64' machine='pc-q35-5.1'>hvm</type>
    <loader readonly='yes' secure='yes' type='pflash'>{path}</loader>
    <nvram template='{path}'>{path}</nvram>
    <boot dev='hd'/>
  </os>

To simply:

  <os firmware='efi'>
    <type machine='q35'>hvm</type>
    <loader secure='yes'/>
    <boot dev='hd'/>
  </os>

Note that none of this goodness is actually used yet. That will come
later.

When running fetch with become, the slurp module will also
be used to fetch the contents of the file for determining
the remote checksum. This effectively doubles the transfer
size [0] and shows up as a MemoryError when the file size
is large enough.

In TripleO this is problematic in large & old deployments
when transferring the /var/lib/mysql folder.

This patch switches to using synchronize instead of fetch
to get the file. This requires rsync on the hosts involved,
but that's a smaller price to pay than failing due to an out
of memory error.

leverage the existing cinder API's ability to create a volume from a
backup, which was added in microversion v3.47.

The shell code is a new v3 implementation, and it drops support for the
v2 command's deprecated '--volume-id' argument.

When running fetch with become, the slurp module will also
be used to fetch the contents of the file for determining
the remote checksum. This effectively doubles the transfer
size [0] and shows up as a MemoryError when the file size
is large enough.

In TripleO this is problematic in large & old deployments
when transferring the /var/lib/mysql folder.

This patch switches to using rsync directly between the src
and dst hosts to transfer the data. This is advantageous not
only for solving the above-mentioned bug, but is also faster.

A simpler implementation using synchronize was attempted [1],
but there were issues with the mistral container which
prevented that approach from being successful.

The images still won't complete building, they get stuck installing
packages like...

    >>> Emerging (1 of 1) dev-python/six-1.15.0-r1::gentoo

...and then sit there indefinitely until Nodepool gives up. The
leaf-most child process is:

    /usr/bin/python3.8 -b /usr/lib/python-exec/python3.8/emerge
        --binpkg-respect-use --rebuilt-binaries=y --usepkg=y

Using strace -p on it, that process seems to be waiting forever on a
futex...

    futex(0x7f512c50f9b0, FUTEX_WAIT_PRIVATE, 2, NULL

...or setting a write lock on a file...

    fcntl(7, F_SETLKW, {l_type=F_WRLCK, l_whence=SEEK_SET,
        l_start=0, l_len=0}

    /opt/dib_tmp/dib_build.hmJmliyA/mnt/tmp/portage-distdir/
        ..layout.conf.distfiles.gentoo.org.portage_lockfile

...and the only unix streams seem to correspond to its parent
process, though there are also FIFO pipes held open by it (to what
I'm unsure, don't see any likely candidates in the process list).

It has been long since we disabled ssl in scenarios. With current
versions of OpenStack projects and libraries, all projects but glance,
which has removed native ssl support with [1], are working fine with
SSL, so we can enable it again.

I'm  leaving scenario002 without SSL to cover both cases in CI.

Libvirt assigns a device alias for each device in the domain and uses
this identifier in the events related to these devices, like device
detach.

This patch extends the LibvirtConfigGuestInterface and the
LibvirtConfigGuestDisk config object to parse the alias back from the
domain config. The alias is intentionally not used during domain XML
generation as it is expected that libvirt will populate and persist
this field.

This is part of the longer series trying to transform the existing
device detach handling to use libvirt events.

When a diskfile is written in a new diskfile dir, then in
diskfile.relink_paths the existence of the diskfile dir is tested
before a call to makedirs. If more than one process is taking the same
action concurrently they may race such that one tests for existence,
then another call makedirs, then the first calls makedirs and an
exception is raised. The first process therefore fails to relink the
object file, which is particularly problematic if the first process
was writing a newer object file.

This patch changes relink_paths to unconditionally attempt the
makedirs but catch and ignore any EEXIST errors.

Testing this in reality is quite hard, so this adds a hacky post-run
script that should create some cruft in the staging directory,
as well as stage an image and then restart glance so we can examine

Since I got the functional tests able to do this like I want, I'm
not sure we need to merge this, but I still want to try to get it

Community images which are not owned by a focused project are not
included in the normal image list API (i.e., without specifying
""community"" as visibility), so we need an extra call of the image
list API specifying ""community"" visibility in a filter.

It was originally fixed by [1] but was dropped in [2].
The main motivation of [2] is to address ""Duplicates in a repeater
are not allowed"" error in the JavaScript console.

The approach of [2] was to drop multiple glance API calls, but
the right solution would be to check duplicated images included
in both API calls. This situation with duplicated images happens
when a community image is owned by a focused project. In such case,
the community image is included in the responses of both API calls.

This commit adds a logic to check image IDs already processed.

When a compute node is added to an OpenStack cluster, the following two
records are automatically registered.
 - service record in nova
 - resource provider record in placement

This patch introduces cleanup tasks to remove resource provider records
during scale down task of nova-compute, so that no resource provider
records are left after compute nodes are removed.
This is required especially when operators want to add compute nodes
with the same hostnames as the removed ones, because these stale
resource provider records prevent newly deployed nodes from joinig the
cluster.

Lower the log level of a warning for a missing output to debug.
This log line appears repeatedly on successful cluster deletion,
creation failure (for unrelated reasons) and nodegroup creation
failure (again for unrelated reasons, eg timeout). This is
triggered when having multiple magnum conductors all trying to
query the status in heat. Additionally, this warning is not an
indication of a malfunction in a cluster or a failure, so it is
useful only for debugging. Finally, add the cluster id, cluster
status and stack id to have more context.

Deletion of images from their backend location currently uses the locations that
are included in the image 'locations' property. This property is filled using a
normal get call with the calling users privileges. For disabled images a
non-admin user receives an empty 'locations' property [1]. This causes a delete call
for an in-use image to succeed and to be deleted from the database, while still being
in the backend store.

To work around this issue a second call with admin privileges is made to get the
full image information including the locations.

The same function is also used for newly created images that are not yet
persisted in the database. We only do the admin get call if the image is acutally loaded
from a database and otherwise use the old behaviour.

Before that patch it was possible to send ICMPv6 packets like e.g.
    neutron_lib.constants.ICMPV6_TYPE_MLD_QUERY,
    neutron_lib.constants.ICMPV6_TYPE_RS,
    neutron_lib.constants.ICMPV6_TYPE_NS,
    neutron_lib.constants.ICMPV6_TYPE_NA

And that could cause some security issues as instance could advertise
that it owns IPv6 address which really don't belong to it.

Now rules in table=71 which allows that traffic are ""per mac/ipaddress""
and are allowed only for fixed ips allocated to port and port's
allowed_address_pairs.

Lower-constraints is not a requirement of the OpenStack Python PTI
[0] and there currently is a discussion on the mailing list [1]
about dropping the test, with the oslo team already having done
so [2].

The new dependency resolver in pip fails due to incompatible
dependency versions in our lower-constraints file, meaning that
we were never providing any real guarantees with it.

To unblock the CI, I am disabling lower-constraints job for now,
with the option to reenable it in case we fix the constraints,
and based on the outcome of the mailing list discussions and
consensus.

If you've got selenium installed (and working), the whole thing can be
automated pretty well; run main.py, wait while some windows pop up (or
use xvfb-run to run things on a virtual display), then check out what
tests were run on which browsers and whether any of them failed. Exit
code is the number of failed tests.

Includes tests against:
- Account
- Containers, with various ACLs/CORS settings
- Objects
- /info
- SLOs
- DLOs
- Symlinks

Include a gate job that runs the tests in firefox.

Areas for future work:

- Install chromium and chromedriver in the gate; tests should
  automatically pick up on the fact that it's available
- Capture the web browser's console logs, too, so we can get
  more info when things go wrong

As reported in LP#1896734, there is a limit in the size of information
that can be transmitted in one single message between an application
and the privsep daemon. The read socket buffer is limited in size;
a message exceeding this size will generate an exception.

In order to limit the amount of information to be sent, this patch
improves the performance of ""get_devices_with_ip"". In the previous
implementation, the whole list of network devices from a namespace
was retrieved. In some environments, the list of devices could be
so big that the list returned by ""privileged.get_link_devices"" can
exceed the read buffer size (as reported in the LP bug when the
OVS agent tries to retrieve the list of IP addresses in the system).

Now the function calls ""privileged.get_ip_addresses"", that returns
a much smaller list. This patch is also reducing the number of system
calls to just one; the previous implementation was retrieving first
the devices link information list (that method was returning a much
bigger blob) and then, per device, retrieving the IP address
information.

When doing multipathed Fibre Channel we may end up not flushing the
volume when disconnecting it if didn't find a multipath when doing
the connection.

The issue is caused by the `connect_volume` call returning a real path
instead of a symlink and us passing the wrong device_info to the
_remove_devices method, which makes the disconnect code incorrectly
identify when a multipath was used to decide whether to do a flush or
not.

This patch fixes these things in order to flush the individual path when
necessary.

This implements distributed image import support, which addresses
the problem when one API worker has staged the image and another
receives the import request.

The general approach is that when a worker stages the image, it
records its self-reference URL in the image's extra_properties.  When
the import request comes in, any other host will proxy that HTTP
request direct to the original host instead of trying to do the import
itself.

If there is too much output produced to the stdout/stderr during the
tests, stestr can hangs and job will then time out.
To avoid that in fullstack job, this patch is doing the same what
was already done for functional job as well - set PYTHONWARNINGS
variable to ""ignore"" to ignore all warnings and not send them to stdout.
All info really needed to debug tests is still in the tests' logs in
specific directories.

As reported in LP#1896734, there is a limit in the size of information
that can be transmitted in one single message between an application
and the privsep daemon. The read socket buffer is limited in size;
a message exceeding this size will generate an exception.

In order to limit the amount of information to be sent, this patch
improves the performance of ""get_devices_with_ip"". In the previous
implementation, the whole list of network devices from a namespace
was retrieved. In some environments, the list of devices could be
so big that the list returned by ""privileged.get_link_devices"" can
exceed the read buffer size (as reported in the LP bug when the
OVS agent tries to retrieve the list of IP addresses in the system).

Now the function calls ""privileged.get_ip_addresses"", that returns
a much smaller list. This patch is also reducing the number of system
calls to just one; the previous implementation was retrieving first
the devices link information list (that method was returning a much
bigger blob) and then, per device, retrieving the IP address
information.

Ceph 16 (Pacific) will support attaching RBD images to Windows

This patch updates the Hyper-V driver so that it may be able to
consume RBD volumes.

We're also updating the os-win requirement to 5.4.0. It should've
been bumped by [2], vms won't spawn without it. Note this introduces no
new or unmet direct or in-direct version dependencies and so is included
as part of this change.

This change updates the default subset to only be the minimum list of
facts for ansible.  In the deployment we need to make sure that we only
collect the minimum amount of facts to perform the tasks at hand rather
than assume we have all the facts.

This change simply bumps the version of os-brick required by Nova to
version 4.2.0. This is itself required by
I9ad90817648ca12f80a6b53f6ba728df15cbafab that introduces support for
rbd volumes within the HyperV driver.

After much back and fourth it was decided to bump the required version
of os-brick ahead of that change to allow the following requirements.txt
and lower-constraints.txt changes caused by direct and in-direct
dependency changes to be documented clearly:

This method was intended to check state of the HA router on the
node and update it in the neutron server.
Patch [1] added check of the initial status to the
neutron_keepalived_state_change_monitor process.
It also could cause some race conditions and event which is setting
correct state of the router will be not processed thus router may endup
with two nodes with ""primary"" state in the Neutron's DB.

Neutron_keepalived_state_change_monitor was notifying agent about
router's initial state only if this state was 'primary'.
Now it will notify agent always to let agent set router's state as
'backup' if needed (that was previously done by this removed
update_initial_state() method).

The recent patch[1] that adds a neutron subnet lookup using the user
context is not honoring the interface/endpoint_type or region_name
settings for neutron in the octavia configuration file.
This is causing problems for deployments that use the ""internal""
endpoint for neutron and the current code will always return
the ""public"" endpoint.
This patch corrects this problem by including those filter
parameters when the neutron endpoint is looked up in keystone.

Starting with the Mimic release and the Ceph RBD clone v2 feature,
it is no longer necessary to manage snapshot protection status.
The usage of clone v2 is controlled via the Ceph “rbd default
clone format” configuration option which defaults to “auto”, but
can be overridden to “1” to force the legacy clone v1 behavior or
“2” to force the new clonev2 behavior.

This must be configured in Ceph, it's not something that can be
configured on the Cinder side.

As an alternative, setting the minimum client to mimic
""$ ceph osd set-require-min-compat-client mimic""

Above all with Ceph RBD clone v2 support enabled, image snapshots
can be cloned without marking the snapshot as protected because
RBD automatically tracks the usage of the snapshot by clones. As
a result Ceph RBD clone v2 API improves performance.

This proposed patch adds logging messages for the operator
indicating whether Ceph has been configured to use the Ceph RBD
v2 clone feature.

In this way the operator can consult with the Ceph administrator
to take appropriate action.

You can determine which volumes are using the clone v2 feature
thanks to volume.volume.op_features(). It returns a value depending
on the v2 clone api being enabled or not.

Also includes squash to fix unit test from:

skip all objects processing when router is UP again, because
the cache is hitting.

When a HA router instance changes the state (active, backup), the
GW interface is set to up or down. As reported in the bug, while
keepalived is configuring the interface, the interface disappears
and appears again from the kernel namespace, as seen in the udev
messages.

This patch is a workaround until the real issue is addressed (if
possible), retrying the interface configuration for a small period

Add an '--all-projects' option to a number of commands:

- server delete
- server start
- server stop

This is in addition to 'server list', which already supports this
option.

This option allows users to request the corresponding action on one or
more servers using the server names when that server exists in another
project. This is admin-only by default.

As part of this work, we also introduce a 'boolenv' helper function that
allows us to parse the environment variable as a boolean using
'bool_from_string' helper provided by oslo.utils. This could probably be
clever and it has the unfortunate side effect of modifying the help
text in environments where this is configured, but it's good enough for
now.  It also appears to add a new dependency, in the form of
oslo.utils, but that dependency was already required by osc-lib and
probably more.

* With new policies, responses of filtering and posted data is
  performed. Testing has been added to the RBAC testing files
  to align with this and the defaults where pertinant.

* Adds another variation of the common policy check method
  which may be useful in the long term. This is too soon to
  tell, but the overall purpose is to allow similar logic
  patterns to the authorize behavior. This is because the
  standard policies are, at present, also used to control
  behavior of response, and node response sanitization needs
  to be carefully navigated.

This change excludes linked resources such as /nodes/<uuid>/ports,
portgroups, volumes/[targets|connectors]. Those will be in later
changes, as the node itself is quite a bit.

Special note:
* The indicator endpoint code in the API appears to be broken
  and given that should be fixed in a separate patch.

The current driver is podman which creates problems when we
try to use the synchronize module for the file copy between
hosts. To make room for this option, we switch to using the
delegated driver and two inventory hosts (which are localhost)
instead which is more efficient, more portable and opens more
options.

We also add 'any_errors_fatal: true' to the play
arguments to ensure that any error stops the whole test.

The converge playbook is targeted at localhost, rather than
all instances, because that is the way that the role being
tested is used in TripleO.

The core OVN code for Loadbalancers does not support a
manual failover from one gateway node to another. But
running the command with the OVN provider driver seems
to succeed:

$ openstack loadbalancer failover $ID
(no output)

The code actually does nothing and just returns the
provisioning status as ACTIVE.

Since it's unsupported by the underlying technology,
have the provider driver return an UnsupportedOptionError().

Currently, we are overriding 'install_command' to use 'pip'. This is
considered poor behavior and 'python -m pip' should be used instead:

It turns out that this is the the default value provided by tox:
