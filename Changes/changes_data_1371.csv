When the number of account/container or container/object replicas are
different, Swift had a few misbehaviors. This commit fixes them.

* On an object PUT/POST/DELETE, if there were 3 object replicas and
  only 2 container replicas, then only 2 requests would be made to
  object servers. Now, 3 requests will be made, but the third won't
  have any X-Container-* headers in it.

* On an object PUT/POST/DELETE, if there were 3 object replicas and 4

  immediate updates; the fourth would be ignored. Now one of the
  object servers will receive multiple (comma-separated) values in the
  X-Container-* headers and it will attempt to contact both of them.

  One side effect is that multiple async_pendings may be written for
  updates to the same object. They'll have differing timestamps,
  though, so all but the newest will be deleted unread. To trigger
  this behavior, you have to have more container replicas than object
  replicas, 2 or more of the container servers must be down, and the
  headers sent to one object server must reference 2 or more down
  container servers; it's unlikely enough and the consequences are so
  minor that it didn't seem worth fixing.

The situation with account/containers is analogous, only without the
async_pendings.

Fix for bug 1095130

* Added a wrapper function around public methods to handle
  CORS actual requests. These requests need to return some
  extra headers to be valid responses to a CORS request.
  Access-Control-Expose-Headers and Access-Control-Allow-Origin.

* Added support for the CORS header Access-Control-Expose-Headers.

* Some refactoring of the OPTIONS method so the
  ""is_origin_allowed"" logic can be reused.

* Added a little extra detail to the CORS documentation.

The libvirt vif driver impls have some helper APIs for creating
and deleteing OVS bridge ports. These are not specific to libvirt,
so move them into the linux_net class which holds other general
Linux networking helper APIs.

With this change LibvirtHybridOVSBridgeDriver no longer needs
to inherit from LibvirtOpenVswitchDriver.

Unlike other file based image backend, operation over LVM
logical volumes requires root to functioning correctly. Resize2fs
on logical volumes also need run_as_root.

Otherwise, when running nova-compute as non-root user, instance
creation with flavor disk size larger than image size would fail.

Fixes bug 1081373

The overall goal of this effort is to make handling of libvirt XMLs
more consistent. First, the on-disk XML file in the instances
directory is never to be used by the libvirt driver. It will be
generated via to_xml(). Second, anytime it is safe to re-define the
XML using the version we programatically generate, we do so.

Extended to_xml() to support a new write_to_disk argument. When true,
this the resulting XML will be written to the instances directory.
Renamed _get_domain_xml to _get_existing_domain_xml, as it should only
be used when we need the XML for a defined domain. It will continue to
fall back to using to_xml() if the defined version is not available.

Hard reboots will now assume nothing about the defined state within
libvirt. Rather, we generate and define the domain every time. This
eliminates the possibility of the hypervisor and Nova database going
out of sync (i.e. volume attached in defined XML with Nova having no
knowledge). We no longer need to pass an xml argument into
_hard_reboot() since it is always generated.

Resume state on boot has been updated with logic similar to that of
_hard_reboot. Again, after a hypervisor reboot (or detection of downed
VMs on compute start), we should not assume the defined XML is valid.
The state or configuration of the VM, from Nova's perspective, may
have been changed while the system was down.

The post_live_migration_on_destination() method used to call to_xml()
without block_device_info. This would result in an on-disk XML without
any volume mappings. The compute manager has been updated to pass bdi
so that this XML can be generated and written correctly. The Mox stub
for this function has been replaced by a stub in the fake virt driver.

Tempauth handles a authorization request by request path.
If a request's path start with auth_prefix, tempauth middleware
handles that request to authorization method.
Therefore, when configuring auth_prefix to '/', all requests
handle to authorization method.

This change enables tempauth to prevent invalid auth_prefix
config '/' and similar empty auth_prefix in initialization method.

Fixes bug #1096538.

because of testr, we can't assume the migrations tests run in
sequence, so they make run all at the same time. This is fine for
our in memory sqlite db, but when talking to a real external
database, not so good.

Since a second mysql test was added, we started racing on these
migrations them often hitting at the same time causing random fails
in gate.

Fix this by moving all the mysql tests into 1 test function, so we
won't race.

As in nova/availability_zones.py, the method get_host_availability_zone()
expects ""context"" as a module rather than a RequestContext object.
But for our preference, the argument ""context"" is better to be a
RequestContext object. So fix this by passing an context object into the
method.

* Fix the usage of argument ""context""
* Add unittest for the module ""availability_zones""

to match with its policy

Get Floating IP Pools is always responding 403 (Forbidden) cause its method
name, which is also being used as action name, doesn't match with the name in
policy.json file.
I opted for this approach cause it also fixes the different names between the
extension (which is named floating **ip** pools instead of floating pools) and
the backend.
Another good practice would be change the default_floating_pool option to
default_float_ip_pool, but that would require change the conf file and possibly
break some compatibility.

solution is not good on scalability.
    With a cache for the host trust level, trusted filter don't need to
consult OAT service if the cache is still valid, thus improves the
scalability. The cache is setup when the first time the filter consulting
the OAT service.
    The trusted_filters are reinitialized for each VM that is
scheduled, thus the cache is valid only for one VM instance scheduing.

    Implements blueprint trusted-filter-cache

According to the following document:

http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/api-error-codes.html

The EC2 API sends specific error codes when keypair listing or
keypair generation fails, specifically the error codes are

InvalidKeyPair.Duplicate - duplicate keypair
InvalidKeyPair.Format - keypair format invalid
InvalidKeyPair.NotFound - keypair not found
ResourceLimitExceeded - keypair quota exceeded

Refactored create_key_pair and describe_key_pair so that
it throws the correct EC2 error codes according to the
public EC2 API specs.

Also removed some duplicate exceptions as well.

Fixes LP: 1072318

We learned a lesson in Nova - it's best to declare and use config
options within a single module if possible. Globally declared and
use config options grow like weeds and it becomes harder to find out
if, where and how individual options are used.

Strangely, in cfg itself, we randomly declare a bunch of logging options
which are only used within the openstack.common.log module - let's move
the options there and remove the CommonConfigOpts class before they
become part of the API we commit to when oslo-config is released.

A minor detail in the patch - the logfile and logdir options are already
deprecated in favour of log_file and log_dir, but we never got around to
removing all other traces of the deprecated options.

In discussions with ttx and zul, it became clear that the git describe info
for our intra-release case wasn't providing any value and was providing
confusion. Additionally, plain git sha's are not providing enough info.

So, the scheme settled on that breaks the least amount of things and yet
still reduces complexity is:

if pre-version: # server projects
  try:
    use current tag
  except:
    use pre-version+revcount+gitsha
else:
  use git describe | s/-/./

Additionally, we'll use a as a prefix for the revcount, b as the prefix for
the milestone portion of a milestone tag, and rc as the prefix for rc's, so
that for our releases, python version sorting works as expected.

This is a squashed commit of work done by Doug and myself.
Thanks Doug!

Author: Angus Salkeld <asalkeld@redhat.com>

    Add a Statistics class
    Note this is a bit different to the spec
    (http://wiki.openstack.org/Ceilometer/blueprints/APIv2)
    As wsme doen't really like different types been returned from
    the same method.

    I have:
    GET /v2/meters/<meter> - raw samples
    GET /v2/meters/<meter>/statistics - for the stats

    Make the error reporting better for invalid fields
    Try and protect from passing in the wrong arguments into the db api
    Also get_resources() takes start/stop_timestamp not start/stop.
    Fix most of the duration test cases (overlapping ones are still broken)
    Add some log messages to warn of unimplemented queries
    Fix the start/end timestamp passed into calc_duration()
    Make the query op default to 'eq'
    Fix v2 event list paths
    Remove v2 list projects tests
    Re-Add the duration
    Implement get_meter_statistics() for sqlalchemy.
    Add tests for get_meter_statistics()
    Fix the latest pep8 1.4 issues

Author: Doug Hellmann <doug.hellmann@dreamhost.com>
    fixme comment
    Fix duration calculation
    fix event listing tests
    remove obsolete list tests
    update resource listing tests
    remove obsolete list tests
    fix max statistics tests for projects
    fix max tests for resource queries
    fix tests for stats using project filter
    Fix sum tests for resource queries
    Fix the statistics calculation in the mongo driver to handle getting
    no data back from the query.
    Update the queries in the test code.
    enable logging for wsme in the tests to help with debugging
    always include all query fields to keep values aligned
    only include the start and end timestamp keywords wanted by the EventFilter
    update url used in acl tests
    update tests for listing meters
    convert prints to logging calls and add a few todo/fixme notes
    add some debugging and error checking to _query_to_kwargs
    add q argument to get_json() to make it easier to pass queries to the service
    do not stub out controller we have deleted
    fix whitespace issues to make pep8 happy

That patch allows nova to use shutil to copy a file directly from the
glance store.  For this to work glance needs to enable direct_url
descriptions in the image metadata.  This is done by setting
show_image_direct_url to True in glance-api.conf.  The path used to back
glance also must match the path used to back nova instance storage.  This
should be a large performance increase for the cases where both glance
and nova instance storage are backed by a shared file system like gluster
or ceph.

A new option has been added to nova: allowed_direct_url_schemes
This option is set to a list of schemes that can be directly accessed.
For this first simple patch only file:// is valid, and the
implementation is simple and inline.  In the future it would be better
to make this into propagation modules which are dynamically loaded
according to the scheme.

As quantum plugin support is coming like floodlight, nvp and nec,
it's worth while to refactor quantum plugin logic so that each plugin can
be modified/enhanced intervening with other quantum plugin.
And new plugin support can be added easily (hopefully) without modifying

Where is the ambiguity?\n\nSo far, with the plural ""Actions"" column header and the arrow image beside the first action name, I haven\'t been aware of problems, but perhaps it\'s easier to miss the additional options in languages with no plural form for nouns. I\'m hoping though, that we can find a way to mitigate the problem that is less text-heavy.\n\nThank you!'}, {'account_id': 5400, 'date': '2013-01-11 03:31:41.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 1:\n\nHi Julie,\n\nThank you for your review. \n\nThis patch was first motivated when I did a demo of horizon for users. They asked where to reboot instances in horizon. Of course they would find the right action options after they playing a while with horizon, but it would be better if we could make the UI more directly, I think. Also they did click on the first action by accident.\n\nAnother concern about this issue is that when there are many instances with different status displayed on the table, the action column would looks cluttered, even worse when the buttons txt are translated into local language such as Chinese.  So a default 'action' button would be more clear.\n\nLooking forward for your opinion.""}, {'account_id': 4264, 'date': '2013-01-11 07:48:57.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't merge this\n\nThank you for your contribution.\nFrom the code, your change looks sane.\n\nI do understand your reasoning, but I disagree here.

You make a good point about the different statuses. I\'m not an expert in UIs so I asked an in-house interaction designer for her thoughts on having an ""Actions"" label on every line. Overall, she seems to think that it would be a bit better than the current implementation.\n\nPROS:\n1) When the button is shown as (for example) ""Edit v"" this might feel a bit odd to a user since they are being asked to drop down an item that reads ""Edit"" to find more items that aren\'t related to Editing necessarily. If this is labeled ""Actions"", then all of the items below are Actions to perform on this instance and it feels a bit more sound.\n2) Users tend to notice when things don\'t match... but if all of the actions read ""Edit Instance"" and one is ""Delete Instance"" this might cause some concern from users. It would at least make them pause and analyze visually what is going on. This is actually a useful tactic in some cases where you want to make an error case stick out in a graph, but I think in this case we don\'t want their eyes to jump around while looking at this page.\n\nCONS:\n1) This adds an extra click if the user wants to choose the first action. I\'m not sure how often these actions are used, so I can\'t comment on how much this might affect the main use cases, but I wouldn\'t be too concerned over this right now.\n2) Users might find it very repetitive at first, but from what I have seen in the past, after using it for a week they won\'t really even notice that it\'s there anymore. They are just trained to click and choose an action.'}, {'account_id': 1816, 'date': '2013-01-15 19:59:14.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 2.'}, {'account_id': 1816, 'date': '2013-01-15 20:01:35.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve\n\nI\'ve uploaded an alternate approach which I think meets a happier middle-ground.

ActionMetaclass.__new__() creates a class object twice. At first,
it uses DeclarativeFieldsMetaclass.__new__() only to get a side effect
of gathering form fields to base_fields, and then it uses type.__new__()
to create the resulting class object. Dropping the first created class
object results in ignoring all that DeclarativeFieldsMetaclass.__new__()
does with it (currently, it adds a 'media' attribute).

This change uses the class object returned by
DeclarativeFieldsMetaclass.__new__() adding Meta options to it,
thereby fixing the issue.

When we delete an instance which is resizing from m1.small to m1.tiny, we use
instance['memory_mb'] to create quota's ram reservation, if the resizing is not
'finished', the in_use value in quota_usages is NOT commited(2048M),

deleting operation after updating will commit a wrong ram reservation(-512M),
and the in_use value changes to 2048-512=1536.
The cores reservation encounters the same problem.

If the call to the driver to resume an instance raises an exception,
then nova-compute fails to start properly. This can happen during
recovery, for example, where an instance has been deleted so the
backing files are gone but the database is restored to a state
where it exists.

This commit merges the test cases for Port Binding Extension in
Linux Bridge plugin and Open vSwitch plugin into a common one.
It makes it easier for each plugin to support the port binding extension.

This commit also adds binding:capabilities attribute to OVS plugin.
Note that binding:capabilities is under discussion and it may be changed
in the future. This change is done just to make OVS plugin support
same as Linux Bridge plugin and pass the common unit test for the extension.

This should fix the failing (but non-voting) postgres gate tests.

Why does postgresql change the value '0.0.0.0/00' to '0.0.0.0/0'?
Clearly the correct value for the network CIDR bits is with only
one zero but even an incorrect value shouldn't be changing.

SQLalchemy is given this for the column:

When hypervisors supply a set of MAC addresses for instances, the
network driver is responsible for matching up the requested MACs and
the available (or requested) networks.

The simplest case, which this patch addresses, is to create ports in
quantum on the desired networks, rather than having quantum create
them dynamically with dynamically created MAC addresses.

the get() function takes an arbitrary id coming from the rest url
for the server. In our current code it checks if this is a proper uuid
and sends it down the uuid path, everything else gets dispatched to
the version that selects by integer id. This means that arbitrary
garbage fuzzed server ids will get sent down the int path, all the way
to the database.

In postgresql, where the db is strongly typed, this causes a type error.
This error was found by tempest nightly runs where we send some 35 and 37
character strings in.

This patch creates and equivalent is_int_like function. If the server_id
is neither uuid_like nor int_like, we throw the InstanceNotFound exception
early. This also saves us a trip to the database in these cases.

Make the is_int_like a little more robust, and don't succeed on floats

Once more with feeling, to let us actually use is_int_like on ints, not
just strings.

The getCapabilities call can be very slow so it is not a good choice
for testing the libvirt connection. This patch switches to
getLibVersion and also caches the result of getCapabilities so it
doesn't need to be requested every time. Note that this means that
nova-compute will need to be restarted if the capaabilities of the
host changes. This is an acceptable risk because capabilities
changes should be very rare and nova-compute should be restarted
if libvirt is restarted or reinstalled.

This simple change lowers boot time in my devstack install from
22 seconds down to 8 seconds!

This adds the following operations to conductor:

  compute_node_create()
  compute_node_update()

It also makes resource_tracker use them instead of making direct
calls to the database.

Further, it introduces a convert_datetimes() helper to the db api,
which can be used internally to convert ISO time strings back to
datetimes, so that we're getting them over the RPC wire. This
should be used in other places in the future to fix similar
situations and avoid one-off conversions in random places.

This removes the last direct database call from resource tracker,
and thus the db import.

    Make Quantum plugin fill in the 'bridge' name

We changed libvirt VIF driver to pull 'bridge' out of the
VIF model. This only worked for new Quantum drivers that
provide the 'vif_type' portbinding metadata though. This
patch effectively reverts part of that patch, so we have
a combination of the new & old method for determining
bridge names. The libvirt VIF driver will look at the
network['bridge'] field first, and if missing will fallback
to its previous logic which hardcoded bridge names.

I took a different approach tho...\n\nIt seems like the main reason you need to pass each daemon and server's conf into the ring is to get the swift_dir and use that as the basis to find the swift_conf path.  I find this interesting because swift_dir started out as a way to define where servers and daemons find the rings. :)\n\nI think i'd like this approach better if the ring's init's used swift_dir directly instead of asking for the whole config blob.  Seems leaky this way.\n\nIn my impl I was mainly concerned about having multiple copies of configs/rings for branch based work.  So I defined the SWIFT_CONFFILE env var to point to swift.conf and it would define a swift_dir option in it's DEFAULT section that would inform the constant SWIFT_DIR - which all further default locations would be based on.\n\nThis way I could:\nexport=SWIFT_CONFILE=~/branch1/swift.conf\nand\nexport=SWIFT_CONFILE=~/branch2/swift.conf\n\nand swift-init and company would just sorta know to use the right configs.\n\nI think I had it sort of working...\n\nI'm sorta curious if you have a deploy that really *can't* have the hash_path_suffix defined in /etc/swift/swift.conf or if you're just more generally trying to clean up something that seems like it should be more configurable?\n\nAlso you may want to check common.constraints, and probetests - probably lots of other places too.

All this reduces code\'s consistency and makes it more difficult to maintain.\n\nThat said, I like the approach you were pursuing by defining a global var that can be used to pass the config file, besides the standard args and paths already defined but, I\'d also add a centralized (?) configuration management in swift in order to read and retrieve configs from a single module in the coude, i.e: from commons import conf. Many projects out there have been using this pattern for their configs and it has turned out to be a good ""standard"" too (imho).\n\nSo, imagine of having that single configuration module:\n\n* It should have some pre-defined configs (those that are always needed for swift to work)\n* It should read the config file and populate itself, or some config object, with the read params and values. (It can get config\'s path either from a env var, a standard path or a command argument)\n* It should validate configs (the validation process could be extended by or ""out-sourced"" to the command / module being executed)\n* It should be available at anytime (maybe with a thread-local cloned version but I would prefer not to do this right now).\n\nThis is what I\'m proposing and I\'d also like to discuss it better with most of the folks since it will require many code to be changed but I consider it necessary, tho.'}, {'account_id': 597, 'date': '2013-01-05 04:44:54.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't merge this\n\n0.

However, glance code does this:\n\n  response.app_iter = common.size_checked_iter(...)\n\nHowever, glance.api.common.size_checked_iter only yields a chunk of data upon each invocation (iteration), which is sent over the wire. Thus setting Content-Length here would violate rfc2616. Another more straightforward example is the usage of WebOb\'s gzip_app_iter (https://github.com/Pylons/webob/blob/master/webob/response.py#L1270) in Response.encode_content (https://github.com/Pylons/webob/blob/master/webob/response.py#L1270): \n\n        if lazy:\n            self.app_iter = gzip_app_iter(self._app_iter)\n            self.content_length = None\n        else:\n            self.app_iter = list(gzip_app_iter(self._app_iter))\n            self.content_length = sum(map(len, self._app_iter))\n\n\'Lazy\' means CTE, no content-length known, the else case is your ""response.body = \'Hello World\'"" case. So WebOb handles the situation according to the RFC and removes the Content-Length header.\n\n> Rather than using chunked transfers, I think we must treat content-length exactly the same as you have proposed we treat md5-sum: We should simply assign it *after* assigning the app_iter.\n\nSince we are using common.size_checked_iter we are always doing CTE (check with curl), hence we must not set it.'}, {'account_id': 616, 'date': '2013-01-10 00:32:19.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 1:\n\nI\'m sure I must seem like I\'m just trying to be difficult, but please bear with me.\n\nIt still seems to me like you are suggesting that whenever we pass an iterator for the response body, we are requiring that CTE be used. But that is not the case.\n\nThe behavior here depends entirely on the wsgi server (and in fact, not Webob). For eventlet, which we use, you can see it only uses CTE if Content-Length is missing (https://bitbucket.org/which_linden/eventlet/src/0cbeac9c857358320ddf5e00bef162ef187255e9/eventlet/wsgi.py?at=default#cl-326)\n\n                if \'content-length\' not in header_list:\n                    if self.request_version == \'HTTP/1.1\':\n                        use_chunked[0] = True\n                        towrite.append(\'Transfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n\')\n                    elif \'content-length\' not in header_list:\n                        # client is 1.0 and therefore must read to EOF\n                        self.close_connection = 1\n\n(There are actually multiple heads to that branch, and I\'m not sure which one is actually used. However they all show the same logic, with albeit different code.)\n\nJust to make sure I checked with curl on a branch where I moved the ""set content-length"" step to after the ""set app_iter"" step. In this case I was saw Content-Length reported correctly and no chunking was used.\n\nI believe my original suggestion still stands. Webob is just being a bit silly by wiping out Content-Length when we set app-iter. As a result, eventlet is using chunked transfer encoding under the hood. If we work around the webob issue by setting the content-length after setting the app_iter, then eventlet does not use a chunked transfer encoding and still happily streams through the response without bothering to buffer everything in memory.\n\nSince we\'ve been pushing around this a bit, I thought I\'d go ahead and push up my alternative.

The old code would use exc_info[0] which is the type of exception, not
the exception itself. This would result in the `message` attribute
always being 'type' and the first-line of details being useless.

The solution is to pass the actual exception object so that `message`
becomes the class-name and the first-line of details becomes the `repr`
of the exception object.

By default, routes.mapper.Mapper.resource adds a bunch of formatted
routes that accept anything after a '.'. Our spec says only .xml
and .json are accepted so limit the formatting to those valuse.

This allows identifiers with a '.' in urls. A few tests were added
to the extensions test to prove that .xml and .json are stripped
but other values are not.

There is a comment in the quantum driver code that says it
ignores the 'bridge' name field. This is misleading, because
the bridge name is still required by any virt drivers when
configuring VIFs so they know how to connect them.

Currently the libvirt Bridge driver invents a bridge name
based on 'qbr' and network['id'], while the OVS drivers
use the libvirt_ovs_bridge config. Move this logic into
the Quantum driver, renaming the config option to
quantum_ovs_bridge. The config option should go away completely
once Quantum can pass across the name, as it does for vif_type

pep8 and hacking.py (by inheritance) have the ability to run self
tests via docstrings, if we format the comments correctly, and change
the docstring test regex. Include self testing in our normal pep8
tests.

fix the comments to actually be test case compliant

fix nova_import_alphabetical to pass on short import lists (only 2
lines, starting at the beginning of a file)

comment where it doesn't appear that hacking.py tests are working
(though there could be deeper black magic in some of them).

fix a doc string in pep8 self tests that breaks N301

fix the fact that pep8 error strings are supposed to start with
\w\d\d\d, we were just lucking out on some formatting because the
string NOVA happened to be only 4 chars long.

Add a couple of escapes so that we don't recursively fail on our
own fail self tests for comments. (boy that's fun)

Add a clear_volume() method that is called from delete_method().
This is only implemented at present for the base LVM driver.
This new clear_volume() method now supports these config vars:

  volume_clear = none, zero, shred
  volume_clear_size = size_in_MiB

'zero' is the default method and unchanged from previously.
'none' is used if security isn't a concern, or there is
  independent volume scrubbing.
'shred' is for more security conscious situations where
an overwrite count is required. Currently this defaults to 3 passes.

size_in_MiB can be used to limit the cleared area to the first
part of the volume, which can greatly speed up the operation,
and can be useful with encrypted volumes for example where
overwritting the encryption keys at the start is sufficient.

I'm not really sure how to articulate my opposition, but I'll try:\n\nI think that this approach ends up adding a ton of bloat and meaningless code to the tree, which ends up just performing mappings between some input and some output, without a lot of ... sanity. It seems to be a wedge in the middle of things to make the tests work, but tests can really only be run in a meaningful way on windows.\n\nI don't really understand why so many points have to be mocked out, when really WMI is all that needs to be faked. I still support fixing this problem with a proper fake implementation that mimics all of the WMI (or any other OS-level interface) behaviors, like the other drivers do. Unit tests for the fake can provide additional guarantees that the fake is doing the right thing.

It is useful to display security group name rather than its id

Also add '--no-nameconv' option to disable conversion from
security group id to its name. When security-group-rule-list is executed
by admin user it is likely more than one groups have same name.
This option is useful for such cases.

If a middleware (swift3, I'm looking at you), doesn't pass a Request
object into the Response constructor, Response._response_iter cannot
know to send zero bytes in the body of the HEAD response.

This patch fixes this usage of swob by making Response.__call__
helpfully reify self.request from env if it wasn't already set by the
Response object's constructor.

This fixes a bug in swift3 + swob-enabled-Swift where HEAD requests to
swift3 resulted in a response with a body in violation of the relevant
RFC and confusing clients.

Thanks to kostecky for finding the bug and describing it accurately.

The horizon.tabs javascript was updating the last row of any <table>
in the tab when the focus was changed to a different tab, stomping
over the last row of the table.

This commit limits updates to tables with the .datatable class,
and adds a class to the updated <span> in affected templates
