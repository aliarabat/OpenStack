To correctly use this script you need to have python-graphviz and
graphvix installed. If you do you can use it to generate a shard range
graph.

As it currently stands it only supports getting information from STDIN.
This was a choice because we're thinking of wrapping it in a docker
container to include all dependencies, so would make it easier to use.

Current usage is:

 $ python swift/cli/shardrange_graph_viewer.py --help
 usage: shardrange_graph_viewer.py [-h] [-i] [-f {svg,png,pdf}] [graph_name]

 Display ShardRange graphs

 positional arguments:
   graph_name            Name of the graph

 optional arguments:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   -i, --info            Data is from container-info
   -f {svg,png,pdf}, --format {svg,png,pdf}
                         Format of the graph to produce
   -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                         Provide an output directory
   -a, --analyze         Run ShardRanges through the analyzer and highlight the best path

If you pass the '-i' it'll assume in the input is the output of
container-info:

  $ swift-container-info ... | python shardrange_graph_viewer.py -i

If you don't it'll assume json:

  $ swift-manage-shard-ranges .. show | python \
    shardrange_graph_viewer.py

Of course you can also load in some json from disk:

  $ python shardrange-graph-viewer.py < <path_to_json>

This will attempt to open the file if you can, but in anycase it'll drop
the graph file in whatever format you specify in the same folder you ran
the script from.

If you use the '--analyze' option then it'll run the ShardRanges through
the s-m-s-r analyze function and then mark the good path in green.

This imports the latest debian/* from the upstream openafs packages,
and builds source packages meant for upload to the PPA we use for
openafs.

Over the years we have found that maintaining our own PPA for this is
useful.  We have hit bugs that require immediate patches to be applied
and rolled out to production, and having a private build facilitates
this.  Generally we hope to have no delta to the upstream packaging,
which is currently the case.

Currently we have a fairly manual process to produce and upload these
debs (once there, the source is obviously available).  This allows us
to keep a little clearer view of what we've changed or are working on.

This doesn't publish anything, yet.  We'll work on that after this;
the idea is that the publishing job will consume the artifacts this
returns.

This patch adds coverage for the various exceptions handled and
raised in get, get_size and delete methods.
It also corrects the behavior of _test_cinder_get_size method where
client.volumes returned dictionary instead of a MagicMock and it
worked due to the existing method ""get"" in dictionary which has
same name as ""get"" method in cinderclient. The dictionary object
is replaced with the appropriate MagicMock object in this patch.

Do not merge (yet).

In Debian, it's nicer to test under uwsgi than with Apache, as that's
probably how our final users will be running the services. Since APIs
are starting automatically, it also causes some scheduling problems to
not use uwsgi (as APIs already bind when Apache starts), for example,
there's such issue with nova-api-metadata.

So, let's switch to uwsgi for the Debian case in puppet-openstack-integration.

This patch also fixes a few API service scheduling issues, and the
creation of SSL certificates in Debian + UWSGI.

the Puppetfile and extract what we need from there. This has also the
advantage of being cross-platform and work with any version of Puppet

In case when 2 neutron servers are trying to remove network from the

Previously, all job definitions where shared across each .zuul.yaml in
both branches. When a job definition was changed in one branch, Zuul CI
could pick the job definition from the other branch, which was not
intended.

The problem arises when mixing explicit job.branches matchers with
implicit branch matching, when defining same jobs on multiple branches.
Zuul CI expects that jobs to be defined in one or the other branch, not
both at the same time. One should only use job.branches matchers from
single-branched projects, e.g. trusted config repos. When defining jobs
in branched repositories one selects which job definition to use by the
branch associated with the triggering event instead.
Each trigger has a branch associated with it, whether it is the branch
targeted by the change being proposed, the branch to which a commit
merged, a branch attached to a timer trigger etc. This branch name is
searched across involved projects in order to determine what job
definition should be used.

The job.branches directive is rarely applied to a job which will be
copied to multiple branches. When you have multiple copies of a job
with the job.branches attribute, Zuul CI could pick any of the job
definitions which might not be the one you expected.
The job.branches attribute is useful in single branch config
repositories where a specific job definition has to be applied to a
specific branch of the repository. Another definition of the job
will exist in another branch of the config repository.

This patch removes job definitions which are specific to other
branches, except for parent jobs which are shared across branches.

Previously, all job definitions where shared across each .zuul.yaml in
both branches. When a job definition was changed in one branch, Zuul CI
could pick the job definition from the other branch, which was not
intended.

The problem arises when mixing explicit job.branches matchers with
implicit branch matching, when defining same jobs on multiple branches.
Zuul CI expects that jobs to be defined in one or the other branch, not
both at the same time. One should only use job.branches matchers from
single-branched projects, e.g. trusted config repos. When defining jobs
in branched repositories one selects which job definition to use by the
branch associated with the triggering event instead.
Each trigger has a branch associated with it, whether it is the branch
targeted by the change being proposed, the branch to which a commit
merged, a branch attached to a timer trigger etc. This branch name is
searched across involved projects in order to determine what job
definition should be used.

The job.branches directive is rarely applied to a job which will be
copied to multiple branches. When you have multiple copies of a job
with the job.branches attribute, Zuul CI could pick any of the job
definitions which might not be the one you expected.
The job.branches attribute is useful in single branch config
repositories where a specific job definition has to be applied to a
specific branch of the repository. Another definition of the job
will exist in another branch of the config repository.

This patch removes job definitions which are specific to other
branches, except for parent jobs which are shared across branches.

modifies the os_tempest role to create only specific tempest

tempest_service_available_neutron and tempest_public_net_create needs
to be true to set the value of tempest_neutron_public_network_id [0].

tempest_neutron_public_network_id is also used in tempestconf
profile [1]. Due to [0], tempest_neutron_public_network_id is coming
undefined if any of the above conditions does not match.

It broke the os_tempest on TripleO undercloud deployment
where we donot have neutron services fully enabled.

By Setting the default value fixes the issue.

During code review of the unified limits implementation, reviewers
requested detail around the enforcement of ""API limits"" (limits that
are enforced only from the content of an API request). This adds a
paragraph to explain how they are enforced using the oslo.limit APIs.

A note about the [workaround]unified_limits_count_pcpu_as_vcpu config
option is also added to explain how operators can opt in to legacy
VCPU + PCPU quota usage counting behavior.

The Controller role will sometimes include swift object storage, and
the ObjectStorage role always will. This means unless the /srv volume
is grown it will be too small for swift to store any useful amount of
data.

The node provision tool has no knowledge of the specific services
deployed in a role, so it can only set growvols_args default based on
the role name. This change makes the default growvols_args role-aware
so that Controller and ObjectStorage roles grow /srv by enough to be
useful.

The documentation will encourage the deployer to consider actual /var
and /srv storage requirements (especially for the Controller role) and
setting custom growvols_args to reflect that.

It is impossible to choose defaults which meet all scenarios because
there are 3 unknowns (workload requirements for /var and /srv, and the
size of the node primary disk) so some discusson of Controller
requirements especially is encouraged.

If /srv or /var are deployed with insufficient space the deployer can
always add a second disk and expand the LVM volume into that, so there
is a mitigation option.

This patch saves the scheduler hint for same_host and different_host
at volume creation time to the volume metadata, so it can be used later.
The volume migrate call looks for these stored scheduler hints in the
volume metadata and adds them to the filter_properties for the scheduler
to see during volume migration.

This effectively allows the scheduler to honor the original affinity
and anti-affinity settings that were placed on the volume at create
time.

This change removes the unused puppet modules from elements. Detail
follows below.

- puppet-openstack_extras is not currently used by puppet-tripleo.
  puppet-corosync is required by puppet-openstack_extras so can be
  removed as well.

- puppet-healthcheck was added[1] so that service availability can be
  checked by the tcp_conn_validator resource, but the resource is not
  used.

- puppet-staging was required by puppetlabs-mysql but is no longer
  required since 7.0.0 [2].

This fixes default values in parameter description which do not match
the actual values or are missing.

Also, the base heat manifest uses downcase() when defining default for
bootstrap node name but this is not used in the other manifests. So
it is also removed by this change.

This parameter was introduced to puppet-neutron but it was completely
wrong and the actual parameter has never been implemented in neutron.

Also, the parameter definition in tht has never taken effect because
puppet-tripleo overrides the definition.

The interval should be configured in ovn controller, and this is
already implemented using puppet-ovn.

There is a race condition in nova-compute with the ironic virt driver
as nodes get rebalanced. It can lead to compute nodes being removed in
the DB and not repopulated. Ultimately this prevents these nodes from
being scheduled to.

The issue being addressed here is that if a compute node is deleted by a
host which thinks it is an orphan, then the resource provider for that
node might also be deleted. The compute host that owns the node might
not recreate the resource provider if it exists in the provider tree
cache.

This change fixes the issue by clearing resource providers from the
provider tree cache for which a compute node entry does not exist. Then,
when the available resource for the node is updated, the resource
providers are not found in the cache and get recreated in placement.

to be quick, both in the backup and in the restore phases, but most of
the B&R provided features (such as storing long-lived backups on a
different machine) are taking a lot of time and they are not useful for
upgrades use-case.

In this context, we developed the Snapshot and Revert feature that
configures an LVM-enabled system to use LVM snapshots.

When using the LVM cinder driver the cacheable capability is not being
reported by the backend to the scheduler when the transport protocol is
NVMe-oF (nvmet target driver), but it is properly reported if it's the
LIO target driver.

This also happens with other drivers that should be reporting that they
are cacheable.

This happens because even if the volume manager correctly uses the
""storage_protocol"" reported by the drivers on their stats to add the
""cacheable"" capability for iSCSI, FC, and NVMe-oF protocols, it isn't
taking into account all the variants these have:

- FC, fc, fibre_channel
- iSCSI, iscsi
- NVMe-oF, nvmeof, NVMeOF

Same thing happens for the shared_targets of the volumes, which are not
missing an iSCSI variant.

This patch creates constants for the different storge protocols to try
to avoid these variants (as agreed on the PTG) and also makes the
cacheable and shared_targets check against all the existing variants.

This change facilitates identifying NVMe-oF drivers (for bug 1961102)
for the shared_targets part.

A lot of effort has gone into the bootloader element doing the right

legacy boot with UEFI boot.

overcloud-full and other partition images have not received the
benefit of this work because they use the much simpler grub2 element.
Now that overcloud-hardened-uefi-full is the default, overcloud-full
may become harder to support over time. Switching to the bootloader
element will reduce the support matrix for the boot handling of this
image.

This changes fixes an issue where the kernel args root option is
incorrect, because the bootloader element does a full kernel options
regeneration.

On a start/reboot, os-net sriov_config.service is run to
create VFs for nic-partitioned devices. If vfio-pci driver
is bound to any of the VFs, the VF initialisation doesn't occur properly.
The VF creation has to be completed before driverctl vfio-pci
binding AND all network interface configs. Since the order of
sriov_config service or driverctl could not be set due to cyclic
dependencies, the driverctl --nosave is used for every reboots
for VFs that needs driver override. This is required in case of
DPDK - NIC Partitioning.

Changes are done to exclude refactoring backport done specifically

The tripleo_ceph_client role's task file to create a Ceph config
file for multiple external Ceph clusters does not support overrides
which are passed via ceph_conf_overrides. The 'openstack overcloud
export ceph' command however generates files with ceph_conf_overrides
as they are necessary for multibackend Glance deployments which use
Ceph. This patch adds a line to multiple_external_ceph_clusters.yml
so that input files with ceph_conf_overrides are passed to the
tripleo_ceph_client_config_overrides for each external Ceph cluster.

Upon bootstrap, the mysqlrouter will create a mysqlrouter.conf file for
the cluster it is connecting to. This creates sections such as
metadata_cache:<cluster_name>, routing:<cluster_name>_rw,
routing:<cluster_name>_ro, etc. The cluster name is not provided on the
mysql-router interface so this information is not available in
determining the correct section name. Since the mysql-router is designed
to work with a single cluster, the need to update the interface which in
turn requires the user to update a number of deployed charms in the
environment, an approach is taken to allow regular expressions to be
used when matching the section name.

There is some risk to this in that it requires that future edits
carefully consider the possible section names when future sections are
added. However, this developer cost is traded off in order to ease the
burden of operators.

For the upgrade scenario, this patch also checks to see if the file
rendered on disk contains multiple 'metadata_cache' sections, and if so
rewrites the mysqlrouter.conf file with the hardcoded
metadata_cache:jujuCluster section removed.

  sort: write error

i.e. the ""head -1"" has exited after reading one line, but ""sort -r""
still wants to write and thus has hit a pipe failure, and because we
run with ""-o pipefail"" this has halted the script.

This seems like it has been there more or less forever, maybe we just
got lucky hitting it now?  Anyway, we can work around this by using a
process substitution and passing the output of this into head, this
way we won't hit a pipe failure.

I also updated the fedora path as it does the same thing.

Ironic fails when deploying nodes using the direct deploy interface or
the iPXE boot interface when using the Ubuntu container images.

This happens because the www-data user running apache cannot read the
image files created by the ironic user.

This change fixes the issue by adding the www-data user to the ironic
group in the ironic-pxe image.

Previously, version-check.py would keep adding stable- to the tag each
time it is run. This was caused by the regex greedily matching stable-
as part of the project name rather than the tag.

This change fixes the issue by updating the regex.

Since there was a few changes inside Neutron which now use primary
instead of master, failover did not properly function.  This patch
handles both master/primary until Neutron moves those keywords into
constants inside neutron-lib.

[Spectrum Virtualize family] During creation of GMCV type volume
there are multiple lsvdisk calls made for checking the existence
of source change volume, aux volume and change aux volume.
Along with these calls there is a lssystem call which can be
optimized.

This patch optimizes these lsvdisk and lssystem calls which in
turn reduces the computational time for creating GMCV volumes.

Previously the owner field was not set by module
`cloud.openstack.image`, although it is specified as a module parameter.
The usual approach in `ansible-collections-openstack` is to accept both
names and IDs when referencing openstack resources.
Therefore this commit follows the approach taken by
`python-openstackclient` in [1] and introduces a `project` and a
`project_domain` parameter to identify projects by name or ID and
assign the ID to the `owner` attribute of the image.
The `owner` parameter is left as an alias to `project` in the module.

If an ""ovn-controller"" ends not gracefully, the node ""Chassis"" and
""Chassis_Private"" registers will remain in the OVN SB database.
Because there is no a mandatory procedure to delete the ""Chassis""
and ""Chassis_Private"" registers, the administrator can manually
delete, from the OVN SB database, any register in any order.

If the ""Chassis"" register is deleted and the Neutron server restarted,
the updated ""Chassis_Private"" register will be read from the database.
That won't contain the ""Chassis"" information as this register has been
deleted. In this case, the ``NeutronAgent`` returns ``DeletedChassis``,
an empty chassis register with no information.

NOTE: the sequence of actions (""Chassis"" register deletion, Neutron
server restart) must be follow to reproduce this issue. If the
""Chassis"" register is deleted, the Neutron server OVN agent local cache
won't update the stored information and will keep the previous value.
It is when the Neutron server is restarted when the OVN agent local
cache is retrieved again; at this time the ""Chassis_Private"" register
won't have any related ""Chassis"" register.

consistency group(CG). Added necessary code changes to
storwize cinder driver to support this operation.

If an ""ovn-controller"" ends not gracefully, the node ""Chassis"" and
""Chassis_Private"" registers will remain in the OVN SB database.
Because there is no a mandatory procedure to delete the ""Chassis""
and ""Chassis_Private"" registers, the administrator can manually
delete, from the OVN SB database, any register in any order.

If the ""Chassis"" register is deleted and the Neutron server restarted,
the updated ""Chassis_Private"" register will be read from the database.
That won't contain the ""Chassis"" information as this register has been
deleted. In this case, the ``NeutronAgent`` returns ``DeletedChassis``,
an empty chassis register with no information.

NOTE: the sequence of actions (""Chassis"" register deletion, Neutron
server restart) must be follow to reproduce this issue. If the
""Chassis"" register is deleted, the Neutron server OVN agent local cache
won't update the stored information and will keep the previous value.
It is when the Neutron server is restarted when the OVN agent local
cache is retrieved again; at this time the ""Chassis_Private"" register
won't have any related ""Chassis"" register.

Disk and container image builds tend to be fairly unreliable.
With 3 voting seed jobs all building images, this can introduce
instability into the CI jobs.

This change adds a non-voting kayobe-seed-images-centos8s job, which
does the following:

* Builds IPA images
* Builds an overcloud host image
* Builds a base container image

Similar Rocky and Ubuntu jobs are added to the experimental pipeline,
and may be run by commenting 'check experimental' in gerrit.

The existing kayobe-seed-* jobs no longer build images.

This reverts commit 840129097631611fe110bbe01b1707f9db000865.

We are reverting this because some users may want to use predictable
device names and may not even use Debian. However, after some
investigation we have found a couple of bugs in dhcp-all-interfaces on
Debuntu distros. The parent change corrects those bugs. Additionally new
Linux kernels emit ""move"" events to udev when interfaces are renamed to
their predictable name. Support this ""move"" in the dhcp-all-interfaces
udev rules. Making these changes appaers to produce functional images
for Debian users using predictable device names. If predictable device
names are not desired turning them off is straightforward and release
notes are updated to give users the info they need to do that outside of
this element.

Currently when dependent service is defined using the depends_on key,
tripleo-ansible adds 'Wants' so that the dependent service is also
started. However this attribute does not guarantee that the dependent
service is started BEFORE the target service is started.

Because current usage of depends_on expect the dependent service is
started before the target service, this change adds 'After' so that
the ordering is properly enforced.

Ephemeral Heat interaction was spread across several areas of the
overcloud deploy, including the entire config-download execution. To
reduce the amount of time that ephemeral Heat needs
to stay running, consolidate all the Heat interaction to a single
try/finally block. The overcloud export is moved earlier in the
execution since it no longer requires Heat API access. This also makes
the shutdown of ephemeral Heat and database backup in just a single
location.

A race condition exists where if the quota_usages
table is empty, multiple simultaneous volume create
operations may introduce duplicate rows with the same
resource (volume) and project_id.

This causes the quota code to generally not function
correctly.

The database should likely have a contraint to prevent
that from happening.  But, this fix will help mitigate
the problem and can be backported to earlier releases,
unlike a database schema change.  It also can be applied
to a deployment that already has a database in this invalid
state.

When quota reservation is done, lock on the project id
for that reservation.  This will introduce a performance
penalty for a single tenant performing many simultaneous
volume creates, but will prevent the quota system from
breaking due to this race condition.

When tox 'docs' target is called, first it installs the dependencies
(listed in 'deps') in 'installdeps' phase, then it installs manila
(with its requirements) in 'develop-inst' phase. In the latter case
'deps' is not used so that the constraints defined in 'deps' are not
used. This could lead to failures on stable branches when new packages
are released that break the build. To avoid this, the simplest solution
is to pre-install requirements, i.e. add requirements.txt to 'docs' tox
target.

removing required_defaults_RedHat.yml;
efi_distro seems to only get used for grub_config_path, and 'rhel'
is not the correct path on my UEFI rhel8 system. It's 'redhat', and
according to the only documentation [1] I found on a quick search,
it's probably been this since EL6. Which means we can use
'redhat' all over the board.

The unique values in efi_distro, grub_efi_binary and shim_efi_binary
correspond to ansible_facts['distribution'], which holds true for
centos and fedora aswell, so we can put all these in RedHat_family

removing required_defaults_CentOS.yml;
The common values from required_defaults_RedHat_family.yml should
suffice.

removing required_defaults_Fedora.yml;
Support for fedora has been deprecated [2], but since it's in the
os_family of redhat, we're only missing 'qemu-kvm' and
'policycoreutils-python-utils' from 'required_packages', so
deployment will probably still work.

As vxlan UDP traffic is allowed, there's no reason to create

the ML2/OVN case with [1].

Cinder backup per_user mode, provides auth_token for swift connection.
This token used by swift for keystonemiddleware authentication during
upload. Large size volume takes more time for backup than the token
expiration and hence backup fails. Instead of using auth_token,
use trusts (if auth_version is 3) which will allow to continue
the upload after token expiration since new token is provided before
the expiry of earlier token. Delete trusts during close connection
(by default it expires after 24 hours).

In the policy_enforcement module if policy.enforce() will raise
PolicyNotAuthorized exception, there is additional check if user is
trying to modify own or someone else resource. In case when user is not
allowed to show resource even, error 404 is raised to ""hide"" any
information about requested resource.
But that was also the case for POST (create resource) requests and 404
error when user is trying e.g. create network is confusing.
So this patch modifies that logic and in case of ""create_"" actions it
will return 403 if user was not authorized to do such operation.

Grafana requires the scrape interval to be set to be able to compute
$__rate_interval. The default is 15s which does not match the kolla
default of 60s. The symptom of not setting this is that you will see
""no data"" when zooming graphs that use rate queries. This occurs as the
interval will be set to a period shorter than the scrape interval.
The recommendation is that you use a common scrape interval for all
jobs. See:

Since we use usedevelop=True, as a result neutron
installation happens at 'develop-inst' phase and it installs
requirements from requirements.txt without considering
tox constraints, This can lead to issue where broken
requirements are installed in docs job and as a result
it will fail.

In order to get constraints be considered for this case, add
requirements.txt to deps for docs env.

Also squashed below commit:-

Docs build: Add NOTE to not remove requirements.txt

To avoid unintentionally remove requirements.txt
from deps list from docs env, add a NOTE.

When using the node managed by the `irmc` hardware type,
if the port number of the bmc address is manually specified,
the following error will occur when configuring raid:

```
%d format: a number is required, not str
```

Change raid to call parse_driver_info to get irmc_info,
so that irmc-port can be converted to int type to avoid this error.

We have seen account stats become distorted: in worst case
an account with only one container drops to reporting zero
bytes and zero object count despite the container having
objects. And can remain stuck until another object is PUT
or DELETEd into the container.

In general the edgecase goes:
  1. a container PUT lands on a handoff at t1,
     so the handoff db has zero object count.
  2. subsequent PUTs land on primaries, say at t2
  3. primaries update account with valid obj count and bytes
  4. handoff update account with zero obj count and bytes
  5. no more objects are PUT so primaries make no more
     updates to account
  6. container replication leaves primary put timestamp
     unchanged because handoff put time is older than
     primary -> no primary updates to account

Then the account remains stuck with zero obj count and bytes
used until an object is put or deleted at which point a
primary will update the account stats.

To solve this problem this patch adds an additional check
to the container-updater. If the broker has no incoming-syncs
then don't update. Missing incoming syncs could mean 3 things:

  1. It could be a handoff database, a primary wont replicate
     with it.
     - If this is the case then it doesn't have a good view of
       the stats to update the account. So we don't want to
       report.
  2. Its a new db on a replica after a rebalance, in this
     case the other ""old"" replicas haven't yet talked with it so
     again it doesn't have a good enough view of the world... yet.
     But after 1 replication sync it's got a much better one.
  3. Its a brand new container, after the initial PUT but before
     the replicators have had a chance to run. In this case we
     loose nothing in waiting until one replica has replicated
     with the others.

To make things a little more complicated, in order to support single
replica container rings we need the ability to all containers to be
able to undate (single replica will have no incoming_syncs).
To solve this the container-updater now loads container ring
metadata (only) to grab the number of replicas. If it's only a single
replica ring then the old behaviour stands, that is any container will
update the account.

When the nova-compute service starts, by default it attempts to
startup instance configuration states for aspects such as networking.
This is fine in most cases, and makes a lot of sense if the
nova-compute service is just managing virtual machines on a hypervisor.

This is done, one instance at a time.

However, when the compute driver is ironic, the networking is managed
as part of the physical machine lifecycle potentially all the way into
committed switch configurations. As such, there is no need to attempt
to call ``plug_vifs`` on every single instance managed by the
nova-compute process which is backed by Ironic.

Additionally, using ironic tends to manage far more physical machines
per nova-compute service instance then when when operating co-installed
with a hypervisor. Often this means a cluster of a thousand machines,
with three controllers, will see thousands of un-needed API calls upon
service start, which elongates the entire process and negatively
impacts operations.

In essence, nova.virt.ironic's plug_vifs call now does nothing,
and merely issues a debug LOG entry when called.

be included at a later time.

The scafolding for the 'About the project' needed to be added
as this is the first page under this category. Most current
""reference"" pages are mis-categorised and will eventually be
moved into it.

The tabs feature was added to Sphinx in order to provide a
reasonable display of the charm channel information.

The `latest` track was greatly de-emphasised due to its
inherent hazardous nature.

There is a reference to ""a special charm operation"" that is
currently unpublished, but that is where details on migration

In multinode, the devstack plugin for networking-generic-switch can't
really work as intended. But, the authorized keys is copied on all
nodes, and zuul puts a consistent key in place, so it doesn't
really need to do what it is doing, but we need to use the stack
user's pre-existing keys to access the remote host.

This will allow Ironic's multinode grenade job to work without
errors about accessing the key file, which is a red herring for
when the connection fails.

Additionally, the underlying ngs code is suseptible to a race on
configuration loading as configuration is loaded separately.

We can't really force it to load the option. We also can't
explicitly add it, so the best thing to do is to wrap it and
rely upon a mock to facilitate the unit test.

When ovn/dns_servers consist of IPv6 dns nameservers,
it was getting added to IPv4 dhcp options also, and due to
this an invalid nameserver(last 4 octets of an IPv6 address)
is set in the instances.

This patch filters IPv4/IPv6 dns nameservers and set
dhcpv4/dhcpv6 options accordingly.

Also when dns_nameservers are not set for IPv6 subnets,
get those from ovn/dns_servers config or system nameservers
just like it's done with the IPv4 subnets. Updated
get_system_dns_resolvers to pick both IPv4/IPv6 valid
ips, this also requires bump of oslo.utils minimum version
to 4.8.0 to use strict option for IPv4[1].

Additionally fix some unit tests which were setting IPv4 dns
nameservers on the IPv6 subnets, this is not allowed with api.

Cinder, but it was finally never implemented.

The goal here is to rely on the Keystone unified limit system[1], in

the enforcing of the quota will be done Glance side, using the

retire any of the unused repositories under the openstack-helm

Importing pkg_resources has a side-effect of scanning the metadata of
all of the installed python modules to build an in-memory cache. That
cache isn't used anywhere in keystoneclient, and it can be expensive
to build.

The importlib.metadata module in the 3.8 standard library (and the
importlib_metadata library for earlier versions) provides the same
version lookup service using a more efficient scanning
implementation. Switching from pkg_resources to importlib.metadata
will help application startup time, which is especially important for
command line programs such as python-openstackclient.

We saw in the field that the pci_devices table can end up in
inconsistent state after a compute node HW failure and re-deployment.
There could be dependent devices where the parent PF is in available
state while the children VFs are in unavailable state. (Before the HW
fault the PF was allocated hence the VFs was marked unavailable).

In this state this PF is still schedulable but during the
PCI claim the handling of dependent devices in the PCI tracker fill fail
with the error: ""Attempt to consume PCI device XXX from empty pool"".

The reason of the failure is that when the PF is claimed, all the
children VFs are marked unavailable. But if the VF is already
unavailable such step fails.

One way the deployer might try to recover from this state is to remove
the VFs from the hypervisor and restart the compute agent. The compute
startup already has a logic to delete PCI devices that are unused and
not reported by the hypervisor. However this logic only removed devices
in 'available' state and ignored devices in 'unavailable' state.

If a device is unused and the hypervisor is not reporting the device any
more then it is safe to delete that device from the PCI tracker. So this
patch extends the logic to allow deleting 'unavailable' devices. There
is a small window when dependent PCI device is in 'unclaimable' state.
From cleanup perspective this is an analogous state. So it is also
added to the cleanup logic.

When new default policy rules and scope enforcement are enabled, Neutron
needs to handle properly not only PolicyNotAuthorized exception from
oslo_policy module but also InvalidScope exception.
This patch adds handling of that exception to the neutron policy
modules.

In the check() method from the neutron.policy module we are calling
ENFORCER.enforce() method with do_raise=False which means that
PolicyNotAuthorized isn't rasised. Unfortunately it seems that there is
bug in oslo.policy module and InvalidScope is raised even with
do_raise=False.
For now, lets workaround it in Neutron by properly handling InvalidScope
exception in the check() method.
This workaround can be cleaned when bug [1] will be fixed in
oslo.policy.
