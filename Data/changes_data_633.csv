It is ok to modify existing migration, since we have 2 cases:
1) the database doesn't include results in old format. In this case the

Gabbi 1.35 provides template variable susbtitution on the left hand side
of a JSONPath expression. That's used here to remove the need for static
fake uuids in the test data for allocation-candidates and the
SharedStorageFixture.

A couple of other clean ups to the use of gabbi, unrelated to the 1.35
update:

* It's possible to test the entire value in one response:

    resources:
         VCPU: 4
         DISK_GB: 5

  instead of:

    resources.VCPU: 4
    resources.DISK_GB: 5

  This is handy when the root of the expression is calculated and
  repeating that calculation is noisy.

* [?foo.bar=baz] is the more canonical form of [?(@.foo.bar=baz)]. The
  former is built into jsonpath, the latter dips into the underlying
  implementation.

into allocate_for_instance to skip the port create step. That object
will have been generated by code that has run earlier in the instance
build flow, before we call the scheduler. Because this state will flow

The refactoring here is trying to ensure we can extract all the logic in
allocate_for_instance up to and including _create_ports_for_instance
into a method that can be called earlier in the instance build process.
This is just the first step in that process.

There are a lot of unit test changes here to ensure we don't pass
invalid mac addresses, because this would fail the unit tests now we are
using an o.vo field of type mac address.

Move test_list_virtual_interfaces into
test_server_misc_policy_actions_rbac.py to further increase gate
stability and decrease gate run time.

The number of calls to create_test_server() should be minimized
for RBAC testing because we don't do too much modification to the
resources that are created -- only what's necessary to trigger the
API action corresponding to the RBAC policy under test. Further,
minimizing such calls reduces the risk of spinning up too many servers
concurrently in our gates: the source of various gate failures as
limited resources lead to server faults being raised.

This adds the support for new style volume attachments
to the swap volume operation.

If the existing volume attachment (old_volume) was created
using the new flow, it will have attachment_id set. Based
on that the API will create a new volume attachment for the
volume being swapped to and then pass that attachment to the
compute over RPC. Note that we do not yet create new-style
volume attachments so this is all no-op code for now. And
when we do start creating new-style volume attachments, that
will only be allowed when Cinder is new enough (3.27 microversion)
and all compute services are upgraded, so we don't perform
any nova-compute service version checks here.

Once on the compute, we key off the new_attachment_id being
passed from the API to tell if we should use the old or new
style calls to Cinder. For example, initialize_connection and
terminate_connection are replaced with attachment_update and
attachment_delete.

This commit does 3 things:
  1a) Corrects the ""config_drive"" tests by aligning the
      tests with the nova policy documentation [0] which
      states that ""config_drive"" is to added the response
      body of showing a server or listing servers with details
      if policy enforcement passes.
  1b) Consequently, 2 tests are added: 1 for show and 1 for
      list with details.
  2) Moves both tests into the misc policy actions file to
     increase gate stability and decrease gate run time.

The number of calls to create_test_server() should be minimized
for RBAC testing because we don't do too much modification to the
resources that are created -- only what's necessary to trigger the
API action corresponding to the RBAC policy under test. Further,
minimizing such calls reduces the risk of spinning up too many servers
concurrently in our gates: the source of various gate failures as
limited resources lead to server faults being raised.

When running the inventory tests on a development machine, using ctrl-c
to send sigint should gracefully finish the current test and clean up
the workspace (tests/inventory).

While most of our tests are well-behaved, without the catchbreak=True
option, sometimes the code would be interrupted in between file creation
and cleanup. Additionally, tearDownModule was never called, leaving
behind inventory/openstack_user_config.yml

This change allows the current test to finish, it's teardown methods to
run, and finally the tearDownModule function to execute, leaving behind
a clean workspace. Only the tests that directly touch the filesystem
were changed.

While this is not impactful for gate tests, it improves quality of life
for developers.

Onetime boot is a feature provided by iLO technology that
allow users to decide the boot order for the next machine
startup. The onetime boot device change takes precedence
to the BIOS boot device settings and is only considered
for the next machine initialization.

In OneView drivers, this feature means that during the
cleaning and deploying phases a single Server Profile
application will be needed for each phase, saving some
time in the overall deployment time. This feature can be
considered optional but nice to have in OneView drivers
since depending of the configurations passed in the Server
Profile, the application can take more than ten minutes.
Use onetime boot is now the default behavior of the driver.

Previously, the synchronization code targetted swift_all and
swift_remote_all groups, ignoring the hosts targetted in the calling
playbook. This meant that limiting the scope of hosts with either a
--limit or splitting up Swift groups (between swift_obj and swift_proxy,
for example), the ring distribution would fail the check, since not all
members of swift_all had been updated.

In addition, the swift_rings.yml playbook would try to run only on the
first swift_hosts node. This host may not be in scope, so it is changed
to only run once per play.

Not all instances of inventory-reliant code are removed in this patch,
only ones necessary to ensuring ring distribution and checks.

The unshelve notification sample test shelve-offloads an instance, waits for
it state to change to SHELVED_OFFLOADED then unshelve the instance and matches
generated the unshelve notification with the stored sample. This test
intermittently fails as the host paramter of the instance doesn't match
sometimes. The reason is that the compute manager during shelve offloading
first sets the state of the instance then later sets the host of the instance.
So the test can start unshelving the instance before the host is cleaned by
the shelve offload code.

The test is updated to not just wait for the state change but also wait for
the change of the host attribute.

deriving cpu_util from cputime is not exact as it relies on timing
of host and a completely independent timing of pollster. this can
cause precision issues with nanosecond timing resulting in >100%
calculations. this sets a cap so at most cpu_util can only report
100% cpu utilisation.

Currently executes once per round of the nova common playbook due to
the ""run_once"", so we set the fact multiple times per deploy, and
mostly when executing against groups that don't consume this fact.

This changes the run conditions for the fact set of
nova_cinder_rbd_inuse, a var which indicates to os_nova that it
should run the ceph_client role because Cinder is using RBD
backends, even if nova is not backing instances with RBD.

The new conditions require that the fact set will occur only if it
is not already set on localhost, only if the host group being
executed against contains nova_compute hosts, and only once (on the
first nova_compute host in the run group).

NOTE: This commit also includes I9f529082fd646e58a6365ec7994f2c87fc9dfb8e,
since a circular dependency exists between this patch and the setuptools
pin bump due to a bug in setuptools. The following is the commit message
of I9f529082fd646e58a6365ec7994f2c87fc9dfb8e in its entirety:
""Update setuptools to 36.2.0

Due to [1] the downgrade of setuptools is not
possible, so this patch is updating setuptools
to the current version as a stop-gap until a
fix is released.

[1] https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1086""

Also includes a backport of Ia1d02070be2d5ab89e5ef51d96773395516d0c8d,
which is a minor var optimization related to this work.

Some changes were made to the way cinder_backends_rbd_inuse is generated
from the master patch, since master no longer requires the var to be
available to the cinder role due to Ie1c549461cfd6799d7535fda673b8c3872afe4af.

In ocata that change did not take place yet so we need to keep that
var available to cinder.

This adds support for the 2.50 microversion which does the following:

* Adds the server_groups and server_groups_members resources to the output
  for the 'nova quota-class-show' and 'nova quota-class-update' CLIs.
* Removes the ability to show or update network-related resource quota class
  values, specifically floating_ips, fixed_ips, security_groups and
  security_group_members.
* Defines explicit kwargs for the update() method in the python API binding.

This also fixes a problem where the 'nova quota-class-update' CLI was
incorrectly capped at the 2.35 microversion for updating network-related
resources. That was true for the os-quota-sets API which is tenant-specific,
but not for the os-quota-class-sets API which is global.

Functional tests are added for the 2.1 and 2.50 microversion behavior for
both commands.

second.  This removes the durability guarantee for the
single node.  However the central concept of Galera is
that durability is achieved via the cluster as a whole,
in that transactions are replicated to other nodes before
the commit succeeds (though not necessarily written to disk
unless wsrep_causal_reads is set).  In this model,
data would only be lost of all nodes of the Galera cluster
were killed within one second of each other.  Percona's
blog post at https://www.percona.com/blog/2014/11/17/typical-misconceptions-on-galera-for-mysql/
recommends that the value of 2 should be considered ""safe""
for a Galera cluster unless you are in fact worried that
all three nodes will be powered off simultaneously.

The value here is added as an option only, defaulting
to the usual default of ""1"", flush per transaction.

It runs networking-midonet unit tests which includes its
neutron-fwaas integration, to expose regressions earlier and
save the effort in both of projects.  Briefly discussed in
a fwaas meeting. [1]

[1] http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/meetings/fwaas/2017/fwaas.2017-06-27-14.02.log.html#l-165

Background: Neutron-fwaas changes sometimes break networking-midonet's
fwaas v1 driver.  It's mainly due to the non-ideal way how the driver
is written.  Ideally we should have a real driver api for fwaas v1.
But the development focus has already moved to fwaas v2.

Note: This job runs the identical set of tests as the voting
counterpart, gate-networking-midonet-python35.  While it includes
tests which are not related to fwaas, it doesn't seem to worth
reducing it to minimum.  We can revisit it if it turns out to be
a problem.

deriving cpu_util from cputime is not exact as it relies on timing
of host and a completely independent timing of pollster. this can
cause precision issues with nanosecond timing resulting in >100%
calculations. this sets a cap so at most cpu_util can only report
100% cpu utilisation.

Commits integrates monasca-agent with monascaclient,
that is currently using osc-lib. That requires some
changes in the initialization model of the client.

Details:
* no need to check if token has expired (underlying library
[osc-lib] will request new token if it is about to expire
* initializing the client happens once therefore keystone.Keystone
instance can be created lazily (it is singleton, so it might happen
it is already available)

Extra:
* marked all variables as private

* ability to evaluate JSON stored in separate files from the yaml

  microversions don't break things

* using substitutions in the left hand side of a JSON query, making
  it easier to refer to a server-side generated identifier in a
  jsonpath expression (good when working with something given a uuid
  during a POST and then looking at the resulting collection entity
  on a GET)

Currently trusted ports (DHCP & router ports) are considered trusted
ports based on theirs owner. Trusted ports are not passed to the
firewall driver and hence the driver doesn't have any way how to deal
with such ports.

This change introduces two new methods to firewall driver API:
 - process_trusted_ports
 - remove_trusted_ports

These methods will give firewall driver a chance to process traffic
coming from the trusted ports in case its needed.

For specific case, see patch depending on this one.

We've recently added py35 non-voting unit tests for ARA [1].
As we ramp up py35 support and testing, it's important to be able to
run integration tests on both py27 and py35 as well.

In order to limit the amount of jobs this would end up running because
we're interested in testing under both CentOS and Ubuntu, we'll compromise
by running py27 jobs on CentOS and py35 on Ubuntu.
We can rebalance the jobs running once Ansible 2.4 is out and 2.1 goes
EOL.

Since py35 is not yet passing for ARA and Ansible itself is working on
full py3 support, only start testing from Ansible 2.3+ and make them
non-voting at first.

This change adds the ability to extend 'in-use' volume.

Once the volume size is extended, Nova is informed of the size change
through the external-event extension so the virt driver can perform
the appropriate actions for the host and guest to detect the new volume size.

There's an implicit assumption in 08-debootstrap that your are
building on $ARCH for $ARCH. If you don't meet this criteria, then the
second phase of debootstrap will fail.

Simplest way to verify this is on a normal x86 system (dpkt
--print-architecture will say amd64) try to build 08-debootstrap with
--arch arm64 or armhf.

This change will launch qemu-debootstrap and assumes that
qemu-arm-static is installed.

Furthermore, when running cross-platform, it isn't guaranteed that
/etc/modprobe.d will exist at the time when we want to stuff the
blacklist file in. So be nice and mkdir it. Otherwise the echo on the
next line will fail.

Add support for the openSUSE Leap distributions. Nothing special is
required for this except for adding the appropriate distro variables
file and also update the zypper cache before package installation.
Finally, we set 'ceph_pkg_source' to 'distro' because upstream does not
provide openSUSE packages.

If we do some resource action(e.g. create/update/delete ...),
UpdateRow will be started.
And then resource status will be updated automatically in front-end.
But in case removing resource, number of resource that displayed
on both above and bottom of table will not be updated correctly.

I fixed update_footer_count function in horizon.tables.js.
This function only updates number of resource in footer field.
(tfoot span.table_count)
But we also need to update header field. (thead span.table_count)
So I add header update logic into this file.

The authentication error message for 'rally deployment check' was
not very specific. I added username and tenant_name information in
debugging mode to make it easier for users to debug. Notice that the
changes are made in credential layer this time.

Also, I refactored the exceptions handling place by concluding
InvalidEndpointsException and HostUnreachableException into one
AuthenticationFailed exception and moving it from
Clients/verified_keystone into Keystone/auth_ref.
Now, verified_keystone will only check if the user is admin and
all other exceptions will be handled in auth_ref().

For tests, I added two unit tests for the Keystone.auth_ref() and
one functional test to check if the authentication error is caught
and if the corresponding details are printed.

Now, the debugging error msg contains the username & tenant name:
""""""
   [-] Unable to connect for user admin in project demo
""""""

kept as the current policy.json in neutron still has it. They are
specific to neutron-fwaas and theoretically it should be moved from

  then configure_tempest;
- execute validate-tempest also when tempest_config is true,

For quite some time, OpenStack services have wanted to be able to send
messages to API end users (by user I do not mean the operator, but the
user that is interacting with the client).

This patch implements basic user messages with the following APIs.
GET /messages
GET /messages/<message_id>
DELETE /messages/<message_id>

Implements the basic /messages resource and tempest tests

An instance action event's finish_time and result can be None when
the event is not yet completed. This is common in Nova. The nova-api
service creates the instance action record and the nova-compute service
has a method which performs the actual operation on the server
instance. The method in the compute is wrapped with an EventReporter
decorator which records the event start and finish times. So until
the event (operation) is complete, the event finish_time and result
are  going to be None.
