Incorporated code review comments
- removed IDE specific values from .gitignore
- moved SSH Key creation into redstack/functions_qemu script
- removed dead files
- added GUEST_USERNAME if needed to override (otherwise inherits host username)
- cleaned up MySQL startup so that it does not start initially

Added ""elements"" directory which contains the parts to build a reddwarf-guest and reddwarf-mysql image
Modified ""redstack"" so that it installs diskimage-builder and copies elements to diskimage-builder directory (temp workaround)
Modified ""redstack.rc"" to point to diskimage-builder repository
Modified ""functions_qemu"" to replace ubuntu vm builder with diskimage-builder

There's not an immediate good solution for quotas on resize with cells
due to how it's implemented.  Will have to revisit this with a better
patch later.  This can lead to some out-of-sync issues when deleting
things in certain resize states... or if there are resize errors.

Store migration information on API cell to correctly handle quotas

Revert and confirm of migrations require access to migration information
so they can calculate the reservation correctly. For new resizes, store
a migration record locally so it can be used later on. For old resizes,
keep the previous behavior (for now).

This patch contains further changes needed to support HostAPI() with
cells.  This moves the formatting of hosts API extension responses back
to the extension itself.  Methods for getting service entries have been
added to HostAPI() that can be overriden in a subclass for cells.

Also contains a performance improvement for 'show' in hosts extension.

data. This is now handled in loguserdata.py.

Note that up until cloud-init version 0.6.0, the user data is not
passed to part-handler. This behavior is why it's not possible to log
the provisioning process with older versions. (Technically could rely
on the redirection support added post 0.6.0, but having a separate
file just for provisioning seems beneficial.)

The _image_create() code in compute manager is the only place where
db.instance_test_and_set is used.. which was added before
'expected_task_state' support was added to instance_update.  By
switching to use self.update(), we can also take advantage of it doing
the state change notification for us.

_create_image() and into snapshot() and backup() to support a future

Adds a VIF plugin model to decouple the Nova Hyper-V compute driver
from the actual networking service in use.
Adds a VIF plugin for Quantum and a plugin for Nova networking.

The VIF driver is selected by mapping the value of the ""network_api_class""
option to the corresponding VIF driver class name, avoiding this way an
otherwise redundant configuration option.

Blueprint quantum-plugin-hyper-v

Initial Hyper-V Quantum plugin including VLAN support.
Support for NVGRE networking will be added in a subsequent patch.
The plugin architecture relies heavily on the OVS plugin, with some
design differences to handle different network types via polymorphism.

The plugin contains two main components:

The plugin itself, to be executed on Linux or Windows
The L2 agent, to be executed on each Hyper-V node

L3 networking is currently handled on Linux with the existing agents.

A Nova Quantum Vif plugin is included in the Nova project.

Currently volume drivers inherit from VolumeDriver and ISCSIDriver,

generally overridden. The problem is that there is no place for
generic code for all drivers to inherit, which the LVM driver can
override. This patch basically makes the VolumeDriver and ISCSIDriver

moved the global _iscsi_location() and _iscsi_authentication()

Updates the test_forbidden_action_exposure in test_exception.py
so that it no longer tries to raise an incorrectly formed

ForbiddenAction exception *should* have all kwargs specified even if
a message is set because in non-debug mode only exception formatting gets used.

Previously this test would pass because exception.py handled all
exception format errors. While handling exception formatting errors is
Okay at runtime ideally we want to check for them when running tests.

This commit also enhances the test_forbidden_action_exposure so that it
checks for the existence of the 'action' in the exception message...

Custom backends will want to provide their own authentication mechanisms
instead of using the Keystone token or EC2-like systems we have in
place.

This adds a new middleware and paste pipeline for the custom backend
that will skip the normal authentication and queries the backend's
`authenticated(context)` method instead.

Since the backend is connected to the Engine whereas the auth middleware
is run in the API service (which may sit on a separate box and have no
access to the engine config or the custom backend itself), we add a new
RPC call that lets API verify the passed credentials.

When a user or group domain role grant is made, the current api
specification states that this should be treated as applying the
role to all enclosed projects.  This change re-defines the meaning
of a domain grant to be a grant on the container itself, so that
role such as Domain Administrator (e.g. maintain users for a
specific domain) can be implemented.

If in the future there is a strong use case for an ""apply a role to
a collection of projects"", then we will consider this with something
like:

Add 'project_id=None' optional argument in QUOTAS related methods.

There are two problems when admin deletes instances of common user
before fixing this bug:
Firstly, It will get tenant quotas using context.project_id which
results in getting admin's quotas not common user's.
Secondly, It will also get wrong quota usages using context.project_id
when updating common user's quota_usages.

So we could pass into QUOTAS related methods an optional argument to
specify the tenant ID to be affected. And if it's not set, then we
default to drawing the tenant ID from the context.

In response to the cessation of per-commit tarballs produced by the CI
systems, simplify the version processing code. We did many many many
complicated things to support producing release artifacts that were not
actually supported release artifacts. After a bunch of issues emerged, it was
determined that the best way forward was to stop producing quasi-not-really
non-release tarballs. If people want to consume versions of openstack that
are not released versions, the git repos are always available.

Additionally, this patch removes versioninfo and just uses PKG-INFO and
pkg_resources to handle version processing.

Previously we were waiting for conductor to respond to a ping() in the
compute manager.  This patch moves this down to the base Service class.
A nova service binary can indicate that db access is not allowed and if
so, as soon as the service gets created, it will block while waiting for
conductor to respond.

The compute service has been updated to use this.  This should not
result in any real functional difference.

The reason for this is that there is some database access that needs to
be avoided down at this level.  This allows us to divert these actions
to conductor if needed.

This patch updates the conductor API to allow passing in a kwarg to
force local usage, even if configured for remote usage globally.  This
is useful if we want to convert some parts of the code to use conductor
db proxy APIs, but want to optimize usage to be local for cases where
using the db directly is not a problem.

libVirt raises a LibVirtError and sets the instance to the

This version implements a configdrive v2 for xenapi as discussed
in the xenapi IRC meetings.

 - the config drive is now iso9660
 - the admin password is injected (if we know it)
 - vbd's are not reused
 - review comments have been addressed

Progresses blueprint xenapi-config-drive. DocImpact.

(Dear documentation people, if using config drive with xenapi,
the user should consider disabling the agent as well with
xenapi_disable_agent. This mostly depends on if they want to
support post-boot password updates still.)

Currently, disk space size calculating in nova doesn't consider the
situation when lvm is used as disk backend. Thus both used and total
disk size are not correct when we use lvm to create instance. This
patch fixes this problem by using 'vgs' to get disk size in such case.

Looks like the nova API now gives an error response instead of an

error code.

The teardown routines in some of the tests were not
waiting for verification that the volume was actually deleted.
As a result it's easy to intermittently hit a case where we run
out of space for volume create in the following tests.

This patch just adds a resource_deletion check/wait after
each volume delete operation to make sure we don't get ahead
of ourselves.

Until oslo provides a tool to handle updating config files, create
a local dumb tool for such purposes

Renames host to host_name in various places to make it explicit what it
is the APIs are accepting and what we are passing around.

Moves logic out of the openstack api's host extension to the compute
library. This is in preparation for cells; cells provides its own
compute library that proxies certain calls to child cells.

In an effort to separate out the layers of code, we're moving all DB
related logic out of the openstack api layer and into compute library
layer.

For example @check_host which calls the DB should not be in the openstack
api layer. In the case of cells, we can't check for the existence of the
host until we arrive at the cell that contains the host.

Commit 6fc00d3465185 (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/18486/)
introduced a couple of problems.

1) It introduced a method to try to deduce instance integer id from
   a name the driver reports and using instance_name_template.  This
   fails badly when you're using something like 'instance-%(uuid)s' for
   instance_name_template.  It's only used when the driver does not
   support the 'list_instance_uuids' method.. but XenAPI happens to
   not implement this method.

2) There's a call to _get_instance_volume_block_device_info() that is
   passing an instance_uuid when the method wants an instance.

Fixes bug 1097987 (#1 above) by doing a brute force match against
   all instances' names.

The Jenkins SCP plugin copies log files that have been copied by
devstack-gate from their normal locations to the log directory for that
particular test run. Sometimes these SCP'ed files are showing up
incomplete and that appears to be happening because the services are
unable to flush their log buffers before copying happens. Sleep for two

flushing.

1) It introduced a method to try to deduce instance integer id from
   a name the driver reports and using instance_name_template.  This
   fails badly when you're using something like 'instance-%(uuid)s' for
   instance_name_template.  It's only used when the driver does not
   support the 'list_instance_uuids' method.. but XenAPI happens to
   not implement this method.

2) There's a call to _get_instance_volume_block_device_info() that is
   passing an instance_uuid when the method wants an instance.

Fixes bug 1097987 (#1 above) by doing a brute force match against
   all instances' names.
Fixes bug 1097978 (#2 above)

In order to do more sophisticated scheduling (e.g. schedule based on volume
type), filter scheduler is introduced. Several changes are made to make this
possible, some of them are similar to the counterpart in Nova:

- add HostState class to host_manager in order to store volume capabilities
- implement get_volume_stats() method of iSCSIDriver as an example to
demonstrate how volume backend driver reports capabilities as well as status
- add scheduler_options.py and 'scheduler_json_config_location' flag to be
allow loading json configuration file for scheduler at run time
- port common filters/weights from oslo
- add capacity weigher (scheduler/weights/capacity.py) for picking up
target volume backend by weighing free capacity of the host. The default
behavior is to spread volumes across hosts; by changing the
'capacity_weight_multiplier' to negative number, volume placing behavior will
become stacking.
- add capacity filter which filters those hosts have insufficient storage space
to serve the request.
- add 'reserved_percentage' config option to indicate how much space is
reserved. Capacity reservation is needed when volume resize is enabled.
- add 'publish_service_capabilities()' method to volume RPC API to allow
scheduler to have volume service report capabilities. This bumps volume RPC
API to version 1.2
- remove 'volume_force_update_capabilities' config option, volume status will be
report to scheduler in every checking.

The implication of this change to storage/backend driver developer:
- implementation of get_volume_stats() of the driver is now a *MUST*, filter
scheduler heavily relies on the status/capabilities reported by backend driver
to makeplacement decision.  To ensure Cinder works seamlessly on the storage
system, driver should at least report following capabilities/status:
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  Capability/Status   |      Description          |         Example
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
 'volume_backend_name'| back-end name, string     | 'Example_Storage_Backend'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'vendor_name'       | vendor name, string       | 'OpenStackCinder'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'driver_version'    | version, string           |  '1.0a'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'storage_protocol'  | supported protocols,      | 'iSCSI', 'RBD', 'FC', 'NFS'
                      | string or list of strings | ['iSCSI', 'NFS', 'FC']
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'total_capacity_gb' | capacity in GB, integer   |  102400
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'free_capacity_gb'  | available capacity in GB, |  1000
                      | integer                   |
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
'reserved_percentage' | reserved space in         |  0, 10
                      | percentage, integer       |
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------

The implication of this change to Cinder administrator:
- the default setting for filter scheduler should work well with the benefits
of:
  * being able to fully utilize capacity of backends (driver now has to report
  actul total space and space utilization and scheduler uses these info) not
  limited by the 'max_gigabytes' config option any more;
  * being able to choose placement policy between spreading & stacking for
  volume creation (by modifying the 'capacity_weight_multiplier' in
  CapacityWeigher)
- with filter scheduler, Cinder is now able to utilize the advanced features/
capabilities provided by different storage back-ends via: defining different
volume types with proper extra_specs. Volume types can be considered as sets
of back-end capabilities requirement.
 For example, a volume type which has 'storage_protocol':'FC' key/value pair
definition in its extra_spec can only be served by those back-ends who report
they support FiberChannel protocol. Another example is volume type has 'QoS'
requirement can only be served by back-ends support QoS.

Note/TODO:
* Currently scheduler makes its decision based on the status and capabilities
information reported by volume nodes, and these information is stored in memory
of scheduler process. More sophisticated way may be add on table in DB to
record status/capabilities of all volume nodes, like Nova does for compute nodes.

The baremetal hypervisor tracks references to instances which are
deleted asynchronously from the commit to the nova bm. As such, its a
normal but rare condition for a bare metal node to refer to a deleted
(and even garbage collected) nova instance. We should treat such
instances are deleted rather than erroring on any call through
list_instances(), permitting starting new instances and listing
instances to work - fixing bug: 1096722.

Pathologically, the database may suffer permanent skew, which means we
need a way to fix it (and thats tracked as a separate bug).

In order to do more sophisticated scheduling (e.g. schedule based on volume
type), filter scheduler is introduced. Several changes are made to make this
possible, some of them are similar to the counterpart in Nova:

- add HostState class to host_manager in order to store volume capabilities
- implement get_volume_stats() method of iSCSIDriver as an example to
demonstrate how volume backend driver reports capabilities as well as status
- add scheduler_options.py and 'scheduler_json_config_location' flag to be
allow loading json configuration file for scheduler at run time
- port common filters/weights from oslo
- add capacity weigher (scheduler/weights/capacity.py) for picking up
target volume backend by weighing free capacity of the host. The default
behavior is to spread volumes across hosts; by changing the
'capacity_weight_multiplier' to negative number, volume placing behavior will
become stacking.
- add capacity filter which filters those hosts have insufficient storage space
to serve the request.
- add 'reserved_percentage' config option to indicate how much space is
reserved. Capacity reservation is needed when volume resize is enabled.
- change default scheduler to 'filter.FilterScheduler'.
- add 'publish_service_capabilities()' method to volume RPC API to allow
scheduler to have volume service report capabilities. This bumps volume RPC
API to version 1.2
- remove 'volume_force_update_capabilities' config option, volume status will be
report to scheduler in every checking.

The implication of this change to storage/backend driver developer:
- implementation of get_volume_stats() of the driver is now a *MUST*, filter
scheduler heavily relies on the status/capabilities reported by backend driver
to makeplacement decision.  To ensure Cinder works seamlessly on the storage
system, driver should at least report following capabilities/status:
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  Capability/Status   |      Description          |         Example
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
 'volume_backend_name'| back-end name, string     | 'Example_Storage_Backend'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'vendor_name'       | vendor name, string       | 'OpenStackCinder'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'driver_version'    | version, string           |  '1.0a'
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'storage_protocol'  | supported protocols,      | 'iSCSI', 'RBD', 'FC', 'NFS'
                      | string or list of strings | ['iSCSI', 'NFS', 'FC']
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'total_capacity_gb' | capacity in GB, integer   |  102400
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
  'free_capacity_gb'  | available capacity in GB, |  1000
                      | integer                   |
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
'reserved_percentage' | reserved space in         |  0, 10
                      | percentage, integer       |
----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------

The implication of this change to Cinder administrator:
- the default setting for filter scheduler should work well with the benefits
of:
  * being able to fully utilize capacity of backends (driver now has to report
  actul total space and space utilization and scheduler uses these info) not
  limited by the 'max_gigabytes' config option any more;
  * being able to choose placement policy between spreading & stacking for
  volume creation (by modifying the 'capacity_weight_multiplier' in
  CapacityWeigher)
- with filter scheduler, Cinder is now able to utilize the advanced features/
capabilities provided by different storage back-ends via: defining different
volume types with proper extra_specs. Volume types can be considered as sets
of back-end capabilities requirement.
 For example, a volume type which has 'storage_protocol':'FC' key/value pair
definition in its extra_spec can only be served by those back-ends who report
they support FiberChannel protocol. Another example is volume type has 'QoS'
requirement can only be served by back-ends support QoS.

Note/TODO:
* Currently scheduler makes its decision based on the status and capabilities
information reported by volume nodes, and these information is stored in memory
of scheduler process. More sophisticated way may be add on table in DB to
record status/capabilities of all volume nodes, like Nova does for compute nodes.

implements blueprint hp3par-volume-driver

We have the driver broken into 2 files:
hp_3par_common.py and
hp_3par_iscsi.py

The reason we do this is because we have a fibre channel driver
that will be submitted shortly after this is committed.   The
fibre channel driver and the iscsi driver share a lot of the same
code that talks to the 3PAR array for provisioning.  So,
it made sense not to have duplicate code.  The fibre channel driver
will be dependent on the fibre channel support I am actively working
on for nova/cinder grizzly release.

The driver uses a 2 mechanisms to talk to the 3PAR array:
1) a python REST client (hp3parclient) that lives in the pypi
   repository here:
   http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hp3parclient

2) SSH.  We had to pull in some of the ssh code from the base san
   driver to help fix an issue with executing commands on the 3PAR
   array.  The 3PAR has the ability to turn on CSV output for command
   results, which makes this easier to parse.  Unfortunately, there
   is no way to turn CSV mode on permanently for all ssh requests.
   So, we have to turn on the CSV output for every single ssh command
   issued.  Since we use ssh as well, we require the san_* options
   to be set.

We use a dual mechianism because the REST API that ships with the 3.1.2
firmware doesn't support all of the capabilities a cinder driver needs
to export volumes.

When a newer version of the firmware comes out that supports host
management on the 3PAR array, then we will get rid of the SSH code.

The goal of this layer is to be able to provide a high
level api reception point for which requests for resources
(initially compute resources) will channel through. It will
handle the complex set of transitions (and unraveling) needed
on errors and state transitions so that the components provisioning
and consuming those resources do not have to be complicated by
such knowledge.

This layer will initially be targeted at working this model
into the compute 'create' call where it can be used to show
others of how such a model is better than what exists currently.

Currently, horizon reboots instance via the 'HARD' mode which
stops instance by destroying it. This would trigger some unusual
behavior for instance(such as reboots twice due to fsck). Nova has
provided scheme to reboot instance in the 'SOFT' mode, which is
more elegant. Thus it is reasonable for us to switch to the 'SOFT'
mode by default.

Instead of having a servers controller that has parsing and
validation of the input wsgi request objects it is useful to
start to centralize this code into a API controller and then
hand-off the objects recieved to a set of request marshaling objects
whose sole job is to validate the input request (using shared
validation methods) and form objects for the API controller
to use.

1. 'index', 'detail' via a common 'SearchUnmarshaller'

Add a new middleware implementing some basic container quotas.

Quotas are subject to several limitations: eventual consistency, the timeliness
of the cached container_info (60 second ttl by default), and it’s unable to
reject chunked transfer uploads that exceed the quota (though once the quota
is exceeded, new chunked transfers will be refused).

However, they get most of the way to container quotas fairly inexpensively.

Quotas are set by adding meta values to the container, and are validated when
set:

  X-Container-Meta-Quota-Bytes: Maximum size of the container, in bytes.
  X-Container-Meta-Quota-Count: Maximum object count of the container.

This is the final step in enabling availability_zones using aggregate
metadata. Previously all services had an availability_zone, but the
availability_zone is only used for nova-compute.  Services such as
nova-scheduler, nova-network, nova-conductor have always spanned all
availability_zones.

After this change only compute nodes (nova-compute), will have an
availability_zone. In order to preserve current APIs, when running:
* nova host-list (os-hosts)
* euca-describe-availability-zones verbose
* nova-manage service list
Internal services will appear in there own internal availability_zone
(CONF.internal_service_availability_zone)
Internal zone is hidden in euca-describe-availability_zones
(non-verbose)

CONF.node_availability_zone has been renamed to
CONF.default_availability_zone and is only used by the nova-api and
nova-scheduler. CONF.node_availability_zone still works but is
deprecated

latter patch will do that.

* Drop availability_zone column from Aggregate table (is now a property)
