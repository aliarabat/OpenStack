The Nova project has made the decision to store the entire
contents of the ""sql_connection"" field in the database, with
alterations to the host value, such that various ""cells"" database
URLs can be located using Nova's database itself as a central
registry of database URLs.

This architecture has produced several problems.   The first
is that it is impossible to apply parameters to the URL that
are local to the client machine; the leading example of this
is the MySQL ""bind_host"" variable, which must match the hostname
of the connecting host.  Because cells puts these URLs into the
database and shares them with all controllers, we have to use a workaround
with the read_default_file parameter to specify a controller-local
file of options; this is not a standard thing
for other database drivers, and these parameters only apply to
the MySQL driver and not the SQLAlchemy engine.

The next issue is that it is inconvenient to add parameters
to the URL at all, once Nova has already been running, as one
must manually use Nova's command line tools
to alter all the URLs that have already been copied into the database
and alter the query parameters with each of those individually,
and then restart *all* services who will all receive the parameter
(no way to add params to just one controller).

Nova's ""store the URL in the database"" feature only needs to be able
to locate the host / database name of the alternate database,
and not change the URL tuning parameters.   This patch adds a new
oslo.db parameter connection_parameters which allows the params to
be applied separately from the sql_connection parameter, so that
Nova can continue persisting sql_connection but the parameters remain
local to the nova.conf file.   A URL parameter that truly had to remain
persisted in Nova's database (there aren't any) could still be applied
at the sql_connection level.

This feature is essential not just so that we can again place
simple parameters into controller-local files like ""bind_host"", but
also to allow for configuration of SQLAlchemy features such as
plugins that do connection pool monitoring.

To work around this we can mount the image cache directory on the host.

This has the same danger as bind mounting the image directory (filling
up the host disk), so it's not a new danger, just one to be called out.

This is causing the ResourceTracker to report 0.0 allocation
ratio values to Placement inventory during the
update_available_resource periodic task because
_init_compute_node calls _copy_resources which copies over
the default allocation ratio values from config (default
to 0.0) but then we don't ""fix"" the 0.0 allocation ratios
via ComputeNode.save() (where ComputeNode._from_db_object
would actually hard-code the appropriate non-0.0 values)
before passing the 0.0 allocation ratios to Placement, which
results in NoValidHost errors during scheduling since
Placement doesn't think there are any valid allocation
candidates available.

The TESTING_BRANCH environment variable is provided by the
run_tests.sh script and is derived from the .gitreview file.

This ensures that once the master branch becomes a stable
branch, the constraints from the stable branch in the
integrated repository will automatically get used once the
.gitreview file is updated.

To ensure that the required environment variables are present
we export them appropriately in run_tests.sh and modify the
tox configuration to pass them into the tox test.

Bionic requires a functioning gpg-agent to run apt-key add. This means
that gpg-agent must be working properly in the chroot when the nspawn
image preparation script runs.

Previous changes [1] have enabled apt-key to communicate with gpg-agent
during the nspawn_hosts role checks, however the cache prep fails almost
every time when nspawn_hosts is used within other role checks.

This is not a new issue, debian-installer is affected too [2].

This change adopts the same route as d-i, and simply copies the host
/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d directory to the nspawn image, removing the
need for apt-key and in turn gpg-agent.

This is a re-implementation of https://review.openstack.org/588962
for nspawn.

this patch adds several things to attempt (on best effort basis)
to use incoming user token in the quota set request to ask Keystone
if the project id the quota being set on is actualy valid:

- added new [keystone] config section to hold session- and
  adapter-realated options for accessing Keystone enndpoint
- added a token- and service catalog-based user auth plugin to the request
  context
- use the above to construct a keystoneauth adapter for Identity service
  and attempt to GET on projects/{project_id}

  - only if the Keystone v3 catalog endpoint is not found, or
    the request returns 404 NotFound, we raise an error and return it
    as 400 BadRequest to client when attempting to change quotas for
    project.

This behavior is enabled by setting a new
[service:api]quotas-verify-project-id config option to True (default is
False for backward compatibility).

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

This patch simplifies the keystone connectivity check to just
get a token instead of making another call that internally gets
a token too. This ensures that only the public keystone endpoint
needs to be accesible, by contrast with the previous project or
region list that needed access to the admin keystone endpoint,
which is usually not accesible from within OpenStack VMs.

This is not the case anymore as fqdns are now stored in facts as
ansible_fqdn while short hostnames are stored in ansible_hostname.

Right now each time 'get_members()' method gets called a new list
is created with fresh instantiation of element type resources.

This ought to be optimized by returning the cached result in
case of repetitive invocations and should the need be to fetch
the refreshed result it would ideally reinstantiate the member
resources of the collection. Also, in case of any member resource
element within collection is being marked as stale, this handles
properly to return the refresh'ed resource if that is accessed
through this 'get_members()' method of the referenced resource
collection instance:

    res_collection_inst.get_members()[any_index].some_attr

to access the current (or live) value of 'some_attr' w/o the need
of recreating (read re-instantiating) the constituent element
resource instance.

This fixes an issue introduced by watchers:
when page initialized images watchers called before
select boot source watcher.it leads to sutiation when
we specify selection from user input and flush it on
updateBootSource. as a result page come to
inconsistent state described in the bug.
Perhaps, this requires big refactoring but  in the
current patch we do not flush selection if boot type
was not changed. it allows to use image, snapshot,
volume from context as ctrl.selection.

This patch includes the changes necessary to bootstrap an
openstack/placement repo that contains code seeded
from https://github.com/EdLeafe/placement . That repo contains
a clone of openstack/nova filtered by the filter_git_history.sh
script from oslo.tools [1]. The result is a collection of the
files that make up the placement service, it's test and docs
and auxilliary stuff. It is not a working repo. It will be
made to work via a series of changes to be reviewed in gerrit
once the new repo is seeded. Initially those changes will be
fairly mechanical, to fix file and import paths, and to remove
unneeded files that were included in the results because they
were non-placement members of commit required in the filtering.

The first commit will add a .zuul.yaml file that sets up some
noop-jobs and non-voting versions of openstack-tox-functional,
openstack-tox-functional-py35, openstack-tox-py27, openstack-tox-py35,
openstack-tox-p27, openstack-tox-pep8. As changes to the gerrit repo
progress, the jobs will be made voting and additional jobs will be added
for docs, api-ref, etc. Eventually the configuration will be update
to use templates.

The placement-core gerrit group will initially be seeded with the
existing nova-core group and a small number of additional people
selected from existing placement contributors.

The openstack/placement repo will initially be a part of the official
nova project. A patch indicating those plans will be made to governance.
It will depend on this change.

Adds the system storage resource of Redfish standard schema.
This new resource represents the properties of a storage subsystem
that represents a set of storage resources consisting of storage
controllers (physical or virtual), volumes and physical disk drives.
The storage volumes are built from physical disks managed by the
controllers.

This patch introduces the properties ``max_volume_size_bytes`` and
``max_drive_size_bytes`` from the StorageCollection resource to
expose the sizes of the largest storage devices (volumes and drives)
available to the System.

Health service plugin implements health check execution support for all
plugins available in the neutron server. Health service plugin maintains
a list of available health checks.

When a health check execution is requested, the health service plugin
determines check implementation according to combination of resource name
and check name (when health of particular resource has been requested
using its ID), or a combination of collection name and check name (when
no ID has been specified). The actual diagnostics is delegated to the
health check implementation.

Other plugins are expected to inherit HealthCheckBaseInPlugin mixin
available from neutron/plugins/common/health.py. Unless customization of
health check search paths is required, it is the only change required to
enable other plugins support for health checking.

Common health check discovery functions are available both for plugins
and agents in neutron/common/health.py. These functions are used to
dynamically determine available health checks. The functions follow the
same pattern that is already used for dynamic loading of API extensions.

If the l3-agent is adding a new router and has a failure

even though it is not fully functional.  Any subsequent update
that arrives will not be able to fix this, as it will not be
able to re-do some of the initialization that should have been

Instead, cleanup the router and schedule a resync so that

The Neutron framework assumes that the details of a vif are the same
cross all nics [1]. But with the macvtap agent they aren't! The vlan
detail might be different for each vif, depending to which network
it belongs to.

The current implementation had a big bug: If first a vif attached to
a vlan network was processed, the 'vlan' was stored in the instance
drivers self.vif_details variable. Now if after that a flat vif is
processed, self.vif_details did still contain the 'vlan' property.
The vif_details (including the vlan property) where sent over to
nova. Due to the 'vlan' property being present, nova was configuring
the macvtap with vlans, even though the vif belonged to a flat network.

The solution is to make a copy of self.vif_details each time we process
it.

Improves auto-allocated topology functionality to support
three configuration types: 'auto', 'fixed', and 'circular',
which are set by the admin in the config file.

The admin creates specific networks and gives them the tag
'__auto-allocatable'. Then, if 'fixed' or 'circular' is chosen,
one of these networks is shared with the tenant when the tenant
auto-allocates a network. 'fixed' assigns only one tenant per
network, while 'circular' can assign multiple tenants to each
network if necessary. 'auto' is the same as the previous
functionality, creating a network, subnet, and router.

First, move segment deletion back to PRECOMMIT_DELETE, which
reverts commit 12d24abba75ab3b926edbac389437bacc23914dd,
""Delete segments on BEFORE_DELETE instead of PRECOMMIT"".

Making the callback _delete_segments_for_network respond to
BEFORE_DELETE network event has created some bugs. In one of
them, it is not possible to delete a routed network, because
the segments cannot be deleted due to the fact that the
associated subnets still exist.

Making _delete_segments_for_network respond to PRECOMMIT_DELETE
introduces a StaleDataError with the standard attributes of the
deleted segments. To work around that, network_db is expired and
read again after notifying the PRECOMMIT_DELETE event in
delete_network in the DB core plug-in.

Second, create a BEFORE notifier in external_net_db to check if
there are associated floating IPs, so it can fail before we try
and delete the network.  The existing BEFORE notifier can then
be moved to PRECOMMIT.

Third, make _ensure_network_not_in_use() a BEFORE notifier,
since that better fits the design of how it is being used.

In order to not delete the networksegments entry for a network,
we must check the network is not in use before issuing the
BEFORE_DELETE notification.

As a side-effect, this could trigger a false-positive if it
is an external network and there are associated floating IPs
configured on it - the notification code can only deal with
un-associated floating IPs.  So we must check for that condition
before calling the BEFORE_DELETE notifiers.

With ipset, When a local agent receives security_groups_member_updated
RPC with remote agent ports, it should only update ipset and shouldn't
reload iptables. This is alternate approach for [1].

In this patch, for security_groups_member_updated RPC, we won't reload
iptables(for both local and remote agent's ports).
When local agent's port security groups are updated, agent will get
port update notification and will reload iptables as part of rpc_loop
processing.

As we are not reloading iptables for remote sg members update,
l2 agent's rpc_loop will finish faster.

will cause an MLDv2 Leave to be sent to indicate we are no longer

master will have sent a Join to update any upstream router
already.

If we then transition to master and IPv6 forwarding needs to
be enabled, then we must toggle the value to zero and back to 1

spec[1]:
""SEGMENTATION-TYPE and SEGMENTATION-ID are optional in both
trunk-create and trunk-subport-add in the generic case, allowing
neutron server to choose the type and id if needed.""

The proposed change makes it not mandatory to have to specify the type
and the id, similarly to how IPs are selected right now when creating
a port. If a segmentation_type and segmentation_id are provided, they
are used as before. However, if no segmentation info is provided, the
default one (in this case the only one available: vlan) is used,
and an available segmentation_id within the defined interval is chosen.
Note there is a random shuffle among the available segmentation
ids to reduce collision probability as well as to speed up the
segmentation_id search.

If SG rules change on a port, SG flows on this port will be recreated.
Although all SG flows for this port will be added into OvS flows by
command 'ovs-ofctl add-flows' one-off, but flows will actually be
added into OvS flows one by one.
If there is a packet from outside to VM pass OvS flows when
'set mark=1' flows matched before SG rules flows added.
This will make mark=1 in conntrack for this kind packets and
result is that the establish-reply packets will be blocked.
It's the same situation for packets from VM to outside.

This patch will move 'set mark=1' flows after SG rules flows added
to avoid this issue.

The Neutron policy enforcement code currently uses the new value
of an attribute (on a PUT request) to validate access to that
same attribute. The reason it does that is because it must specify
a key-value pair for the policy enforcement code to judge whether
or not the role has access to modify it. However, instead of putting
the new value in that key-value pair, it should be using the existing
value fetched from the database, if it exists. If it does not exist,
the key-value pair should be generated and put into the resource
object being modified before the object is passed to the policy
engine. Then after the policy engine validates access successfully,
the object attribute should be given the new value to be put into
the database.

Motivation: prevents false positives caused by test
exceptions matching the expected exception before or
after the ``override_role`` context is called.

This patchset changes expected_error_codes behavior [0] by checking
errors explicitly outside the override_role context. This is done
by introducing a new function to rbac_rule_validation that is
used for validating that the expected exception isn't raised too
early (before ``override_role`` call) or too late (after
``override_call``) or at all (which is a bad test).

This means that exceptions raised prior to override_role
call result in failure. The same goes for exceptions raised
after override_role -- except for those that are an instance
of BasePatroleException (which is valid for things like
RbacMalformedResponse getting raised intentionally).

The new exception that is introduced is called
RbacOverrideRoleException.

Unit tests are added for all validation scenarios described
above.

Postponing until after Newton/indefinitely. It's apparent that the
various services treat policy files differently; glance's allows
everything but filters in code, and neutron's is more complete. We may
need to rethink the approach a bit but it's too late in the release now.

This is very very WIP (and isn't plumbed in yet) but it demonstrates
turning policy checks into RBAC rules. The intent is to replace the
default RBAC queries with policy-based ones if present.

When [upgrade_levels]/compute=auto, the RPC ComputeAPI client
gets the minimum nova-compute service version to determine the
RPC API pin version. This requires a roundtrip to conductor. If
nova-compute and conductor are starting around the same time, like
we see in our CI jobs, the call to conductor can hit an RPC
MessagingTimeout and kill the nova-compute service.

This change does two things:

1. Moves the RPC ComputeAPI client initialization to a bit
   later in the nova-compute service startup routine. Note
   that post_start_hook still runs before the service is
   joined to the service group in the service group API.

2. Adds a retry decorator which will retry for a total
   of three attempts to init the compute RPC API client. Failing
   that, nova-compute will still fail to start as before.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

Reorganize plans fetching into separate actions which are
separately invoked when needed PlansList lists the plans, PlanCard
loads plan details - plan-environment.yaml to fetch the description.
Plans store is reorganized apropriately, this leads to simpler
reducer as there are no collisions between plans and plan details
loading.

Prepare EditPlan and EditPlanForm as plan editting is currently
broken, the form is going to be fixed in subsequent patch

Plans transitions are handled as a List of transitions

When plan is created, it is automatically added to plans list
and newly mounted PlanCard takes care of fetching the details.
No plans refetch is required

There is no reason to rely on comments in the files
used to bump the SHAs of upstream repositories.

Without this, a contributor can easily add a comment
and break the tooling, which relies on regexps and
well formated files to behave.

Instead, as this is a YAML file, we should rely on
a YAML parser in the release tooling, for more
robustness.

This fixes the issues by adding an extra key
(_git_track_branch) per repository, showing what to track.
This could be used in release tooling, and is not hurting
the existing code, as the extra keys are not loaded:
Those files are only consumed by the py_pkgs lookup, which
won't read this extra key.

The old release job uses tox to run setuptools commands. This requires
that the dependencies for the package being released also be
installable with pip.

The networking-bgpvpn package depends on networking-odl which depends
on a git URL for ceilometer, which is not on PyPI and therefore cannot
be installed with pip.

In order to unblock the rocky release for networking-bgpvpn, we go
ahead and switch the release job template to the new form of the job,
which uses the newer PTI and does not require tox to build the
package.

This is a proposal for adding support for live migration in the VMware
driver. When the VMware driver is used, each nova-compute is managing a
single vCenter cluster. For the purposes of this proposal we assume that
all nova-computes are managing clusters under the same vCenter server.
Migrating instances across vCenters is supported starting from vSphere
6.0. We can add support for this as a next-step after this blueprint is
implemented.
