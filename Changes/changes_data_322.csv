ComputeNode.supported_hv_specs field has hypervisor_type
infomation about which type (e.g. KVM or both KVM and QEMU) of guests
are supported by the hypervisor, but it doesn't supply information
about which virt_type is set to that compute node.

This means that we have no way to know which type of guests are going
to be built in that compute node from the ComputeNode object. This can
cause wrong behavior in scheduler filters using the supported_hv_specs
object, such as ImagePropertiesFilter.

In libvirt driver, this patch adds a filter to exclude supported
hypervisor_types other than the virt_type which has been set by
operator via nova.conf.

In a new feature in Neutron, a user will be able to add ethertypes other
than just IPv4 and IPv6 as part of security groups.  In order to
properly test this, a fullstack test is being created that sets up a
tcpdump and then crafts a packet with a custom ethertype, to make sure
that the packet is detected.  The library we use to create the packet
with the custom ethertype, scapy, needs to be added to the global
requirements list.

New requirement questionnaire:

1.) Is the library actively maintained?

Yes, the library is under active development as you can see from the
commit frequency graph [1].

2.) Is the library good code?

Yes.  Scapy is commonly used in the security community to craft packets
(the same use we would like for it here) and is considered the best
library for this purpose in Python from those I have talked to.

3.) Is the library python 3 compatible?

Yes, Scapy supports python 2.7 as well as python 3.4 through 3.7.

4.) Is the library license compatible?

Scapy is licensed under the GPL v2, which is listed as an incompatible
license per [2].  Since this is a testing use case for this library, the
instructions indicate that this should be sent to the legal-discuss
list.

The primary alternative for this library is PyPacker [3] which is also
GPL v2.

5.) Is the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu
latest / Fedora latest)?

Yes it is [4].

6.) Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries
in global-requirements.txt?

I have not reviewed all 500 or so libraries in global-requirements.txt,
but no I am not aware of any other library included in
global-requirements.txt that allows for construction of arbitrary
packets.  If there is one I would be happy to use it.

7.) Is the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or
infrastructure setup? Which?

Yes, this is required for OpenStack Networking (neutron) to provide
fullstack testing for the custom ethertypes feature.  The custom
ethertypes feature spec [5] has a full description.  For more
information see the top paragraph here.

8.) If the library release is managed by the Openstack release process
does it use the cycle-with-intermediary release type?

This library is released outside the OpenStack release process.

9.) Do I need to update anything else?

Projects needing to use scapy will need to add tcpdump to their
bindep.txt.

There's no particular reason for us to be verifying mock's behavior.
They have their own unit tests for doing that.

This is specifically a problem right now because mock changed its
behavior in 3.0.0 and broke this test: ""Issue #36366: Calling stop()
on an unstarted or stopped unittest.mock.patch() object will now
return None instead of raising RuntimeError, making the method
idempotent.""

If a container or name contains special characters, openstacksdk was failing to
access them.

I found we just specify tenant_id for creating SG, but force specify
project_id for creating SG rules. This may cause compatible issue.
So this patch keep SG rules same with SG creationi and test in upstream
CI.

This issue raises by https://review.opendev.org/#/c/662724/ , it seems a
small nit that force to specify project_id to create SG_rule. But other
resources, such as Network/SG just pass tenant_id. So it may cause some
compatible issue, or keep the same like other resources at least.

extraction of placement to its own repo. This is enough a functionality

There are 3 related fields(id, uuid and hostname) in ComputeNode[1].
according to [2], after nova api 2.53, the id of the hypervisor as a UUID.

proper umask value is not applied leading to permission issue

The binding:profile key might be missing from the port body but it also
can be present with a value None. So accessing the value of the
binding:profile needs special care. There is already a
_get_binding_profile() helper in neutronv2/api but still code inside
that module uses manual access in some placese. Also the heal port
allocation codepath used manual access.

So this patch makes _get_binding_profile public and replace manual
binding:profile access with the call to this helper.

The bug prompting this is a tempest test which is requesting
a port attachment to a server but not specifying a port or
network to use, so nova-compute looks for a valid network
and finds there are two and raises NetworkAmbiguous. This
is treated as a 400 error in the API but because this is a
synchronous RPC call from nova-api to nova-compute,
oslo.messaging logs an exception traceback for the unexpected
error. That traceback is pretty gross in the compute logs for
something that is a user error and the cloud operator has
nothing to do to fix it.

We can handle the traceback by registering our expected
exceptions for the attach_interface method with oslo.messaging,
which is what this change does.

While looking to just add NetworkAmbiguous it became clear that
lots of different user errors can be raised from this method
and none of those should result in a traceback, so this change
just expects Invalid and its subclasses.

The one exception is InterfaceAttachFailed which is raised when
something in allocate_port_for_instance or driver.attach_interface
fails. That is an unexpected situation so the parent class for
InterfaceAttachFailed is changed from Invalid to NovaException so
it continues to be traced in the logs as an exception.
InterfaceAttachFailedNoNetwork is kept as Invalid since it is a
user error (trying to attach an interface when the user has no
access to any networks).

test_tagged_attach_interface_raises is adjusted to show the
ExpectedException handling for one of the Invalid cases.

This migration was added in Ocata and backported to Newton in change
I8a05ee01ec7f6a6f88b896f78414fb5487e0071e to deal with Mitaka-era
build_requests records that would not have an instance_uuid value
and thus raise a ValueError in BuildRequest._from_db_object (because
BuildRequest.instance_uuid is not nullable).

This is essentially a revert of that change now since operators
have had long enough to run the migration. If anyone were to skip
level upgrade from Mitaka to Train (which we don't support, we require
you to roll through), and hit an issue with this they could simply
execute this on their nova_api DB:

  DELETE FROM build_requests WHERE instance_uuid IS NULL;

This is to create the foundation for supporting resource
extensibility as proposed in Redfish specification [0]. In essence
it tries to provide a framework to dynamically load the varied OEM
resource extensions using stevedore. The target entry points are
lazily invoked on demand. Other features as below:

* Provides an attribute 'oem_vendors' in Resource Base class
  to discover the available OEM extensions. Also provides another API
  to get the resource extension object based on the OEM vendor string.
* Provides the foundation for classes which can parse OEM extension
  attributes. Also a framework to dynamically load the varied OEM
  resource extensions using ``stevedore``. The target entry points
  are lazily invoked on demand.
* Entry points added with name 'contoso' in setup.cfg. All Entry point
  names are as lowercase_underscore_joined.
* A new folder structure added for OEM extensions framework -
  'sushy/resources/oem/'
* Provides a fake resource extension as a ready reckoner for OEMs.
* Uses the existing json sample which consists of OEM string as
  'Contoso', a fictitious company, for unit testing purpose.
* Add Resource OEM extension related exceptions

If you want to have vrrp watch the external networking interface
today, the option ha_vrrp_health_check_interval [1] detects a failure
it re-triggers the transitional change - which works if the external
physical interface fails because the ping will fail.

In fact, we've tried to enable it before [2], but then we had to
revert it [3] due to instability issues [4] in previous releases of
OpenStack. Maybe the previous instability issue [4] was caused by
another keepalived issue mentioned in the comment [5], now I have
tested this option again, it works.

This is how neutron allows monitoring southbound network today, so
I would suggest we add this capability into the charm again.

This is a patch for charm-neutron-openvswitch side to support
enable-dvr-snat=True option which allows running gateway components
on compute nodes (as of 19.04 charms, see [6])

_fully_qualified_name was copied from Twisted. The original
version does more than Placement needs. We only need to
handle module-level classes and functions (and really only
functions). No nested of those, nor object methods in any
form.

This is because we only use the method for finding the
right microversioned handler of a method with the same
name and placement HTTP handlers are universally functions.

The previous version of the method had code that was never
called. Here, that dead code is removed and the remainder
is simplified.

If it is called incorrectly there will be an (intentionally)
untrapped TypeError during running of the tests.

N.B.: This was discovered while reviewing coverage data.

When sahara uses trust scoped token to create another token,
keystone isn't allowed. To do so to invite elevation of privilege attacks.
So we need to identify the trust scoped token to prevent to create
another token.

The solution to the problem:
When the token is trust scoped token, we add auth_ref and prevent to
create another token.

- When checking whether sahara-api is up, use a proper (?) URI

Mention the new way to specify hosts where instances are launched.
Compare with these two ways.

Also fixed a few things in the existing docs:

1. Fixed the policy rule name for forced_host.
2. Updated the ""openstack availability zone list"" command to use the
   --compute option.
3. Replaced the ""openstack host list"" example with
   ""openstack compute service list --service nova-compute""

Placement can run just fine on OSX but running the tests can
be a bit cumbersome since dev libraries for ssl, postresql,
and mysql are required (directly or indirectly) by
test-requirements.txt, even though for non-gate testing we don't
usually need them, and dealing with dynamic libraries is a
frequent source of pain and discomfort on OSX.

This change says ""don't import SQL drivers for mysql and postgresql
when testing on darwin"".

[stable branch policy requiring a backport rather than an 'in branch'
revert means that the following revert SHA refers to the parent patch,
not to this branch]

This reverts commit e8d0ee1b144f4db24367ad48bd2cb4306add6672.

This commit is reverted for two reasons:

* It is undesirable that the end user can inject proxy config into
  the magnum-conductor service via the cluster template.

* The proxy settings for the magnum-conductor service may not be
  the same as those which are required in the cluster template for
  the end user VM.

Systemd, docker and podman all include native mechanisms for setting
environment variables for proecesses, and this should be used by the
cloud operator / deployment tooling to configure the required proxy
settings for the magnum-conductor service.

In particular this patch makes it impossible for the cloud operator
to specify their own http_proxy via the environment, the user supplied
cluster template setting will always be used.

When an active node introspection is performed
where an entry already exists in ironic, but inspector
has never seen the node before, we enter a state where
we should allow introspection to occur, but that we don't
have a cache record.

As a result of no cache entry, we presently fail hard claiming
the node's port already exists. In the case of active nodes,
This will always be the case, so we need to add a cache
entry and allow the process to... somewhat continue as if
normal introspeciton is occuring.

file conflict. This commit fixes the issue by including only

a py36 target (though py27 and py35 are what we actually test

revert this to make py36 work as before and for those with
only py37 systems they will have to use a different

Before I97f06d0ec34cbd75c182caaa686b8de5c777a576 it was possible to
create servers with neutron ports which had resource_request (e.g. a
port with QoS minimum bandwidth policy rule) without allocating the
requested resources in placement. So there could be servers for which
the allocation needs to be healed in placement.

This patch extends the nova-manage heal_allocation CLI to create the
missing port allocations in placement and update the port in neutron
with the resource provider uuid that is used for the allocation.

There are known limiations of this patch. It does not try to reimplement
Placement's allocation candidate functionality. Therefore it cannot
handle the situation when there is more than one RP in the compute
tree which provides the required traits for a port. In this situation
deciding which RP to use would require the in_tree allocation candidate
support from placement which is not available yet and 2) information
about which PCI PF an SRIOV port is allocated from its VF and which RP
represents that PCI device in placement. This information is only
available on the compute hosts.

For the unsupported cases the command will fail gracefully. As soon as
migration support for such servers are implemented in the blueprint
support-move-ops-with-qos-ports the admin can heal the allocation of
such servers by migrating them.

During healing both placement and neutron need to be updated. If any of
those updates fail the code tries to roll back the previous updates for
the instance to make sure that the healing can be re-run later without
issue. However if the rollback fails then the script will terminate with
an error message pointing to documentation that describes how to
recover from such a partially healed situation manually.

Since 4817165fc5938a553fafa1a69c6086f9ebe311af, when reverting a
resized instance back to the source host, the libvirt driver waits for
vif-plugged events when spawning the instance. When called from
finish_revert_resize() in the source compute manager, libvirt's
finish_revert_migration() does not pass vifs_already_plugged to
_create_domain_and_network(), making the latter use the default False
value.

When the source compute manager calls
network_api.migrate_instance_finish() in finish_revert_resize(), this
updates the port binding back to the source host. If Neutron is
configured to use OVS hybrid plug, it will send the vif-plugged event
immediately after completing this request. This happens before the
virt driver's finish_revert_migration() method is called. This causes
the wait in the libvirt driver to time out because the event is
received before Nova starts waiting for it.

The neutron ovs l2 agent sends vif-plugged events when two conditions
are met. First the port must be bound to the host managed by the
l2 agent and second, the agent must have completed configuring the
port on ovs. This involves assigning the port a local VLAN for tenant
isolation, applying security group rules if required and applying
QoS policies or other agent extensions like service function chaining.

During the boot process, we bind the port first to the host
then plug the interface into ovs which triggers the l2 agent to
configure it resulting in the emission of the vif-plugged event.
In the revert case, as noted above, since the vif is already plugged
on the source node when hybrid-plug is used, binding the port to the
source node fulfils the second condition to send the vif-plugged event.

Events sent immediately after port binding update are hereafter known
as ""bind-time"" events. For ports that do not use OVS hybrid plug,
Neutron will continue to send vif-plugged events only when Nova
actually plugs the VIF. These types of events are hereafter known as
""plug-time"" events. OVS hybrid plug is a per agent setting, so for
a particular host, bind-time events are an all-or-nothing thing for the
ovs backend: either all VIF_TYPE=ovs ports have them, or no ovs ports
have them. In general, a host will only have one network backend.
The only exception to this is SR-IOV. SR-IOV is commonly deployed on
the same host as other network backends such as OVS or linuxbridge.
SR-IOV ports with VNIC_TYPE=direct-physical will always have only
bind-time events. If an instance mixes OVS ports with hybrid-plug=False
with direct physical ports, it will have both kinds of events.

For same host resize reverts we do not update the binding host as the
host does not change, as such for same host resize we do not receive
bind time events. For same host revert we therefore do not wait for
bind time events in the compute manager.

This patch adds functions to the NetworkInfo model that return what
kinds of events each VIF has. These are then used in the migration
revert logic to decide when to wait for external events: in the
compute manager, when binding the port, for bind-time events,
and/or in libvirt, when plugging the VIFs, for plug-time events.

Below commit added the stable/stein for Patrole which is not
correct- https://review.opendev.org/#/c/650173

This commit removes the branching from stein patrole release.

As next step, we will add some type(as proposed by ttx[1]) or
tag to make it clear that Patrole does not need branch.

Migrations use the libvirt driver's get_host_ip_addr() method to
determine the dest_host field of the migration object.
get_host_ip_addr() checks whether CONF.my_ip is actually assigned to
one of the host's interfaces. It does so by calling
get_machine_ips(), which iterates over all of the host's interfaces.
If the host has many interfaces, this can take a long time, and
introduces needless delays in processing the migration.
get_machine_ips() is only used to print a warning, so this patch moves
the get_machine_ips() call to a single method in init_host(). This
way, a warning is still emitted at compute service startup, and
migration progress is not needlessly slowed down.

This patch also has a chicken and egg problem with the patch on top of
it, which poisons use of netifaces.interfaces() in tests. While this
patch fixes all the tests that break with that poison, it starts
breaking different tests because of the move of get_machine_ips() into
init_host(). Therefore, while not directly related to the bug, this
patch also preventatively mocks or stubs out any use of
get_machine_ips() that will get poisoned with the subsequent patch.

When provided (or either '--image' or '--flavor' is specified) to the

In some situations this can significantly speedup the execution of the

When the --name-lookup-one-by-one option passed to the 'server list'
command, the image and flavor names will be looked up for each
server being listed instead of fetching all image/flavor names.

The current code assumes all servers have an image attribute, but
servers booted from volumes have no image, so the following error is
raised when listing BFV servers with --name-lookup-one-by-one:

  AttributeError: ('unicode'|'str') object has no attribute 'get'

The error occurs when the code attempts server.image.get('id').

This fixes the --name-lookup-one-by-one code not to assume an image
for a server. The unit tests for 'server list' have also been
robustified to feature one BFV server to enhance our test coverage.

  Run revert resize tests in nova-live-migration

  In order to test multinode resize revert (which is currently only
  tested in the single node tempest-full-py3 job), this patch renames
  the nova-live-migration job to nova-multinode and makes it run revert
  resize test via a Tempest RC file. The existing live migration and
  evacuate tests are left as post-test hook scripts because they do
  things like change Tempest settings, start Glance, and force down
  compute nodes.

  [DNM] use iptables in nova-multinode

  This patch is jsut for testing to see if we can repoduce the
  issue we are seeing downstrem upstream.

  my current working theroy is because we are using iptables
  in the downstream ci which enable the hybrid plug workflow it
  change the timeing of when the network events are sent.

  in a non hybrid plug case the network events are sent after the
  vm is resumed and libvirt plugs the interface back into ovs
  in the hybrid plug case as we have not called unplug on the souce
  node the veth pair and intermeidate linux bridge still exist when
  we activate the souce binding so the event woudl be sent imedetly before
  we start waithgin for it. this is what we belive is the souce of the
  bug and this shoudl hopefully repoduce it.

This is the commit message #3:

  Add neutron-tempest-iptables_hybrid job to experimental queue

  Due to regression bug 1833902 we should have the option to
  run the neutron job that tests the OVS hybrid plug configuration
  on specific patches.

  We could eventually consider running this in the check queue
  like neutron-tempest-linuxbridge with a strict set of irrelevant
  files but that would require some thought, i.e. we'd want to run
  the job on changes to nova/compute/manager.py since the network
  vif model bind events code is used in the ComputeManager and is
  specific to OVS hybrid plug ports. Rather than get bogged down in
  thinking up what that set is, this change takes the easy path and
  just throws the job into the on-demand experimental queue.

Cassandra Time to Live (TTL) is applied per-column in a
row, and with a default TTL for the table.  The Cassandra
driver appears to have been written with a misunderstanding
that the TTL was per-row, and as a result the update
statements were written to avoid writing all cells.
But that results in some cells in the row not being updated,
and after their TTL expires they are removed, so a metric
query may result in partial data (updated_at set but
metric_id and created_at missing).

This fix changes the statement used when a new measurement
is received to use the same insert statement for the metric
row and thus refresh the TTL for all the columns.

A follow on patch should be created to remove the Update
statements for Measurements, and consider refactoring/removing
the caching model.

Update of network's segmentation_id was introduced in [1] but
there was no API tests for it.
This patch adds fullstack tests which tests API calls to update
this attribute of vlan networks.

It is done in fullstack tests instead of tempest API test becasuse
this feature is dependend of used backend driver. Currently it is
supported only by openvswitch L2 agent.
In tempest API tests we don't have full controll of what L2 agent
is used to bound ports thus we can't be sure how test will behave.

In fullstack tests we have full control of this so it's easier to
implement such tests.

Even though there was a py36 test enabled in the gate, the tox.ini
configuration was not actually invoking the unit tests.  This
change sets up the environment to allow tests to run.

As a result, a number of Python3 errors are uncovered and fixed.

Notably:
  Python 3 does not have contextlib.nested, so reformatting using ,
  file() is not in Python 3, so use io.open() instead
  Use six.assertCountEqual(self, in tests

safe_decode:
  subprocess.check_output returns in byte encoding, while default text
type str. safe_decode does the right thing by making sure string are not
bytes in python2 and python3

No ascci encoding:
 python3 defaults to UTF-8 encoding, which is merely an extension to
ascii (default for python2).

test_json_plugin.py:
 the file being opened in binary(wb) mode so python is expecting the
string in bytes.

Some of the refactoring should be revisited after we drop Python 2
support.

This fixes a bug where if an image had a parent that was skipped, it
would never get built. Normally when a parent finishes building it
triggers the build of its children. This process is kicked off by Kolla
finding the grandparents that have no parents above them. However,
sometimes parents should be skipped, and in this case they would never
get scheduled, and so their children would never build, producing a
strange error without much information.

Fix is to allow building an image if its parent is explicitly marked as
having been skipped.

The use-case for this is when you want to iterate on building an
image without going through the cost of re-running the parent builds. In
particular, if your builds are using Git sources, which break Docker
caches, the cost of parent builds is high and the feedback loop during
development has a much higher latency. Allowing some way for images
to be rebuilt in a targeted manner is helpful when in the development
phase.

When the --name-lookup-one-by-one option passed to the 'server list'
command, the image and flavor names will be looked up for each
server being listed instead of fetching all image/flavor names.

The current code assumes all servers have an image attribute, but
servers booted from volumes have no image, so the following error is
raised when listing BFV servers with --name-lookup-one-by-one:

  AttributeError: ('unicode'|'str') object has no attribute 'get'

The error occurs when the code attempts server.image.get('id').

This fixes the --name-lookup-one-by-one code not to assume an image
for a server. The unit tests for 'server list' have also been
robustified to feature one BFV server to enhance our test coverage.

When starting nova-compute for the first time with a new node,
the ResourceTracker will create a new ComputeNode record in
_init_compute_node but without all of the fields set on the
ComputeNode, for example ""free_disk_gb"".

Later _update_usage_from_instances will set some fields on the
ComputeNode record (even if there are no instances on the node,
why - I don't know) like free_disk_gb.

This will make the eventual call from _update() to _resource_change()
update the value in the old_resouces dict and return True, and then
_update() will try to update those ComputeNode changes to the database.
If that update fails, for example due to a DBConnectionError, the
value in old_resources will still be for the current version of the node
in memory but not what is actually in the database.

Note that this failure does not result in the compute service failing
to start because ComputeManager._update_available_resource_for_node
traps the Exception and just logs it.

A subsequent trip through the RT._update() method - because of the
update_available_resource periodic task - will call _resource_change
but because old_resource matches the current state of the node, it
returns False and the RT does not attempt to persist the changes to
the DB. _update() will then go on to call _update_to_placement
which will create the resource provider in placement along with its
inventory, making it potentially a candidate for scheduling.

This can be a problem later in the scheduler because the
HostState._update_from_compute_node method may skip setting fields
on the HostState object if free_disk_gb is not set in the
ComputeNode record - which can then break filters and weighers
later in the scheduling process (see bug 1834691 and bug 1834694).

The fix proposed here is simple: if the ComputeNode.save() in
RT._update() fails, restore the previous value in old_resources
so that the subsequent run through _resource_change will compare the
correct state of the object and retry the update.

An alternative to this would be killing the compute service on startup
if there is a DB error but that could have unintended side effects,
especially if the DB error is transient and can be fixed on the next
try.

Obviously the scheduler code needs to be more robust also, but those
improvements are left for separate changes related to the other bugs
mentioned above.

Also, ComputeNode.update_from_virt_driver could be updated to set
free_disk_gb if possible to workaround the tight coupling in the
HostState._update_from_compute_node code, but that's also sort of
a whack-a-mole type change best made separately.

This patch fixes it by add /var/lib/docker to kubelet container's mount.

This reverts commit e8d0ee1b144f4db24367ad48bd2cb4306add6672.

This commit is reverted for two reasons:

* It is undesirable that the end user can inject proxy config into
  the magnum-conductor service via the cluster template.

* The proxy settings for the magnum-conductor service may not be
  the same as those which are required in the cluster template for
  the end user VM.

Systemd, docker and podman all include native mechanisms for setting
environment variables for proecesses, and this should be used by the
cloud operator / deployment tooling to configure the required proxy
settings for the magnum-conductor service.

In particular this patch makes it impossible for the cloud operator
to specify their own http_proxy via the environment, the user supplied
cluster template setting will always be used.

bootstrap container on any host in glance-api group could be broken,
since it needs the container configuration.

This change only runs the bootstrap container on hosts in the
glance_api_hosts list, which in the case of the file backend typically
only contains one host.

This change also fixes up some logic during rolling upgrade, where we
might not generate new configuration for the bootstrap host.

Commit a5244d6d44d2b66de27dc77efa7830fa657260be changed the check
order so regular non-dvr ports are checked for agent restarted.
However regular ports may be unbound already, which leads to the
error in the bug description: agent_restarted check is done against
a 'None' agent.
This patch fixed logic back - only check agent_restarted for dvr ports.

This also adds some logging to have a clue why update port up/down fails.

Trying to deploy OpenStack environment consisting of ironic nova
hypervisor & hardware Ironic node (not VM Ironic node) with devstack
got failed. When trying this, followings are set in devstack local.conf
file; ""VIRT_DRIVER=ironic"", ""IRONIC_BOOT_MODE=uefi' and
""IRONIC_IS_HARDWARE=true"".

Failure is due to three bugs in script in ""devstack"" & ""Ironic"":
 (1) function configure_nova_hypervisor in
     devstack/lib/nova_plugins/hypervisor-ironic,
 (2) function install_ironic in ironic/devstack/lib/ironic and
 (3) function configure_ironic_dirs in ironic/devstack/lib/ironic.

Because ""VIRT_DRIVER=ironic"" & ""IRONIC_IS_HARDWARE=true"" is set,
devstack doesn't install libvirt related packages. So, attempt to copy
files/directories to filesystem paths to be created when installing
libvirt related packages gets failed.
When ""IRONIC_BOOT_MODE=uefi"" is set, bug (2) & (3) occurs. Because
function install_ironic & configure_ironic_dirs tries to configure
libvirt related settings (e.g. modify /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf) and
there is no filesystem path related to libvirt, error occurs.

This commit fixes bug (3) by adding ""if"" clause to determine Ironic
node is hardware or not and to skip libvirt related operations when
Ironic node is hardware.

This patch creates a new 'supported' driver for Seagate (STX) FC and
iSCSI arrays by renaming and re-enabling the old 'unsupported' dothill
driver.  Other than marking the driver as 'supported', this patch
contains no changes in functionality.

Other drivers which referenced the dothill driver are modified to use
the Seagate class names, so users of those drivers will not be affected.
