In Ussuri, nova stopped using separate Ceph keys for the volumes and vms
pools by default. Instead, we set ceph_nova_keyring to the value of
ceph_cinder_keyring by default, which is ceph.client.cinder.keyring.
This is in line with the Ceph OpenStack integration guide [1]. However,
the user used by nova to access the vms pool (ceph_nova_user) defaults
to nova, meaning that nova will still try to use a
ceph.client.nova.keyring, which probably does not exist. We did not see
this issue in CI, because we set ceph_nova_user to cinder.

This change fixes the issue by setting ceph_nova_user to the value of
ceph_cinder_user by default, which is cinder.

In Ussuri, nova stopped using separate Ceph keys for the volumes and vms
pools by default. Instead, we set ceph_nova_keyring to the value of
ceph_cinder_keyring by default, which is ceph.client.cinder.keyring.
This is in line with the Ceph OpenStack integration guide [1]. However,
the user used by nova to access the vms pool (ceph_nova_user) defaults
to nova, meaning that nova will still try to use a
ceph.client.nova.keyring, which probably does not exist. We did not see
this issue in CI, because we set ceph_nova_user to cinder.

This change fixes the issue by setting ceph_nova_user to the value of
ceph_cinder_user by default, which is cinder.

When connecting volumes to the underlying host the virt drivers can
attempt to stash additional metadata returned from os-brick into the
connection_info associated with a bdm. This pretty janky behaviour
relies on someone later calling .save() against the underlying
BlockDeviceMapping object to persist these changes into the database as
happens in the driver block device layer during a standard volume
attach.

However during pre_live_migration no call was made to .save() resulting
in the changes made to the connection_info being lost. This change
simply introduces this call at the end of the pre_live_migration method
on the destination via the driver bdm objects we provide in
block_device_info.

The lower-constraints test was removed because of an issue where pip
could not correctly determine the required packages versions to install,
ending in an almost infinite loop that would end up in timeout, failure,
and general mayhem.
Recently the issue has been fixed and, if properly configured, the
lower-constraints test can provide good indication of which minimum
versions are required to support the current code.
This patch adds the test back to the current development branch, and it
runs only on master.
The lower-constraints file will stay in the future stable branches.

Adjust minimum requirements and test-requirements as consequence of
compatibility tetst.

There is a race condition in nova-compute with the ironic virt driver
as nodes get rebalanced. It can lead to compute nodes being removed in
the DB and not repopulated. Ultimately this prevents these nodes from
being scheduled to.

The issue being addressed here is that if a compute node is deleted by a
host which thinks it is an orphan, then the resource provider for that
node might also be deleted. The compute host that owns the node might
not recreate the resource provider if it exists in the provider tree
cache.

This change fixes the issue by clearing resource providers from the
provider tree cache for which a compute node entry does not exist. Then,
when the available resource for the node is updated, the resource
providers are not found in the cache and get recreated in placement.

There is a race condition in nova-compute with the ironic virt driver as
nodes get rebalanced. It can lead to compute nodes being removed in the
DB and not repopulated. Ultimately this prevents these nodes from being
scheduled to.

The issue being addressed here is that if a compute node is deleted by a host
which thinks it is an orphan, then the compute host that actually owns the node
might not recreate it if the node is already in its resource tracker cache.

This change fixes the issue by clearing nodes from the resource tracker cache
for which a compute node entry does not exist. Then, when the available
resource for the node is updated, the compute node object is not found in the
cache and gets recreated.

Bug 1853009 describes a race condition involving multiple nova-compute
services with ironic. As the compute services start up, the hash ring
rebalances, and the compute services have an inconsistent view of which
is responsible for a compute node.

The sequence of actions here is adapted from a real world log [1], where
multiple nova-compute services were started simultaneously. In some
cases mocks are used to simulate race conditions.

There are three main issues with the behaviour:

* host2 deletes the orphan node compute node after host1 has taken
  ownership of it.

* host1 assumes that another compute service will not delete its nodes.
  Once a node is in rt.compute_nodes, it is not removed again unless the
  node is orphaned. This prevents host1 from recreating the compute
  node.

* host1 assumes that another compute service will not delete its
  resource providers. Once an RP is in the provider tree, it is not
  removed.

This functional test documents the current behaviour, with the idea that
it can be updated as this behaviour is fixed.

The check_rabbitmq_queues nrpe check accesses the cron file created
for running collect stats job. This is done in order to determine if
the stats are too old and an alert should be raised. The nagios user
does not have access to read the cron job when running in a hardened
environment where /etc/cron.d is not readable.

This change refactors this logic to move the calculation of maximum
age for a stats file from the check_rabbitmq_queues script and into
the rabbit_utils code where it is generating the nrpe configuration.
A new (optional) parameter is added to the check_rabbitmq_queues
script to accept the maximum age in seconds a file can last be
modified.

This change also removes the trusty support in hooks/install and
hooks/upgrade-charm as the rabbit_utils.py file needs to import a
dependency which is installed by the scripts. It is cleaned up to make
sure the croniter package is always installed on install or upgrade.

Patch [1] fixes cleanup of default security group for
tempest.api.network.admin.test_negative_quotas.* tests but also
introduces a bug [2] that makes the tests fail when preprovisioned
credentials are used.

This patch reverts some changes from patch [1] and tries to
fix the cleanup of default security group in a way that works
also for preprovisioned credentials.

Fix for bug #1893263 introduced a regression where
1 vcpu instances would fail to build when paired with
multiqueue-enabled images, in the scenario vif_type=tap.

Solution is to not pass multiqueue parameter when
instances.get_flavor().vcpus = 1.

Previously, if we wanted to list the inconsistent objects per PG,
we needed to call 'ceph health detail' to get the list of inconsistent
PGs and then 'rados list-inconsistent-obj $PG' for each PG. This patch
aims to implement a single action that does all that and formats it
as a pretty JSON.

With the current way, the ending message is a bit too similar when we
get a success or a failure:
""with error"" compared to ""without error"" is too close, and it's easy to

You can create a snapshot and then create a volume from that snapshot.
Until this patch, if you then tried to delete your snapshot, the RBD
driver would raise ImageBusy as the snapshot still has dependent
children.  Since delete_snapshot() is asynchronous, the client is not
notified of the situation, and confusion ensues.

This patch changes the delete_snapshot behaviour by hiding snapshots
that have dependent children until the final child volume is deleted.
Upon final volume deletion, the 'pending' snapshot is then removed.

There are a few benefits to this approach:

  1. The user is no longer exposed to RBD implementation details and
     snapshot removal works as expected.
  2. By hiding the snapshot, any volume sharing that the children are
     benefiting from remains intact.  This is why my earlier
     auto-flatten patch was a bad idea.

Add update-trilio action which can be run after a Trilio
upgrade.

Trilio sometimes updates packages in package repositiories that
require DB migrations or config file changes. Since these package
updates are not applied by the charm as they would be by changing the
openstack-origin or triliovault-pkg-source the charm has no event to
react to to automatically perform the post package upgrade actions.
This change adds an action `update-trilio` which can
be run to apply the changes.

Manila does not support an API micro version called '1.0';
micro versions are a function of the v2 API, and they begin
with micro version 2.0.

However, in some tests, we use the notation '1.0' to indicate
the deprecated v1 API; this notation is problematic with the way
the tests are judged for skipping based on versions supported.

The skip check method [1] checks whether the version being requested
is supported per min and max versions in the config file. By default,
the min version is set to 2.0 [2]. So these tests are ALWAYS
being skipped, e.g.:

manila_tempest_tests.tests.api.test_security_services.SecurityServicesTest.test_list_security_services_with_detail_1_1_0 ... SKIPPED: Skipped. Test requires microversion '1.0'.

So wherever we use this skip-if-unsupported-api-version logic, we can
replace '1.0' with '2.0' since we know functionally API micro version
2.0 behaves exactly like the v1 API.

This commit doesn't eliminate all instances of '1.0' in the tests; we
could consider doing that in a subsequent change; for now preserving
the other tests as is will give us the advantage of still testing the
deprecated v1 API paths.

During live migration process, a _live_migration_monitor thread
checks progress of migration on source host, if for any reason
we hit infrastructure issue involving a DB/RPC/libvirt-timeout
failure, an Exception is raised to the nova-compute service and
instance/migration is set to ERROR state.

The issue is that we may let live-migration job running out of nova
control. At the end of job, guest is resumed on target host while
nova still reports it on source host, this may lead to a split-brain
situation if instance is restarted.

This change proposes to abort live-migration job if issue occurs
during _live_migration_monitor.

Some of the methods in cinder store are only used by the Store class
methods and not used outside.
It makes sense to bound them to the class.
This refactoring will also help in handling the None imports inside
the class configure methods which will be done in a followup.

This patch also updates cinderclient version from v2(deprecated) to
v3(current).

We remove the following two bind mounts:
- /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/cinder:/var/lib/kolla/config_files/src:ro
- /var/log/containers/cinder:/var/log/cinder:z

Because they are contained in cinder_common_volumes, which will also
bind mount the etcd certs appropriately when needed. Since
cinder_common_volumes also containerd ContainersCommon -> volumes
we are not removing any bind mount.

At present, the collection and compression of static file is
carried out asynchronously to speed up execution. If compression
starts before collection has completed it can result in incomplete
results which cause the Horizon front end to produce 500 errors.

This patch switches the collection of static files back to a
synchronous task before triggering the slower compression as an
asynchronous task to maintain most of the speed-up benefit.

This wasn't as complicated as feared. We're mostly able to copy-paste
the existing sqlalchemy-migrate migration and simply changes the pattern
of calls from monkey-patched 'create' methods such as:

  agent_builds = Table('agent_builds', meta,
      sa.Column('created_at', sa.DateTime),
      ...
      mysql_charset='utf8'
  )
  agent_builds.create()

to explicit alembic APIs like:

  op.create_table(
      'agent_builds',
      sa.Column('created_at', sa.DateTime),
      ...
      mysql_charset='utf8'
  )

Reviewers are encouraged to diff the old migration file,
'nova/db/main/legacy_migrations/versions/402_train.py' against the new
one, 'nova/db/main/migrations/versions/8f2f1571d55b_initial_version.py',
to ease their job. The only significant divergences are the removal of
a single reference to the 'migrate_version' table created by
sqlalchemy-migrate, which obviously won't exist in an alembic-only
world, along with some reordering of tables. The latter step is
necessary since Alembic is not smart enough to correctly order the
creation of tables so that tables that reference (via a foreign key) one
or more other tables are created after the table(s) they reference.
Since we now have to create tables using the 'create_table' API as noted
above, rather than by creating a 'Table' instance and calling the
sqlalchemy-migrate-provided 'create' API as we could previously, we must
reorder our calls. The alternative would be to leave the creation of any
'ForeignKeyConstraint' until later but that seems no better and would
arguably be harder to read.

Note that this isn't yet wired up to anything: users can run it manually
but the nova-manage commands we provide are still connected to the
sqlalchemy-migrate commands. This will change shortly when we add shims
to handle the conversion.

Some things that were missed in previous patches and are thrown together
here:

- Add alembic as an explicit dependency (we were getting it transitively
  from oslo.db). We also bump the sqlalchemy dependency to a 1.4.x
  release, which is the minimum supported by our chosen version of
  alembic (more on this below)
- Remove tooling related to the old migrations
- Fix the tox whitelisting of the flaky MySQL tests

On the SQLAlchemy front, we opt for 1.4.13. Technically alembic should
support anything from 1.4.0, however, with SQLAlchemy >= 1.4.0, < 1.4.13
we see errors like the following in some tests:

  sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Entity namespace for
  ""count(instance_mappings.id)"" has no property ""queued_for_delete""

There's nothing specific about this in the release notes for 1.4.13 [1]
but it definitely fixes things.

This looks more complicated than it is, but it's really quite simple.
Essentially we have to deal with two possible configurations:

- For existing deployments, the DB sync operation should apply any
  outstanding sqlalchemy-migrate-based migrations, dummy apply the
  initial alembic migration, and then apply any additional alembic-based
  migrations requested (or any available, if no version is specified).

- For new deployments, the DB sync operation should apply the initial
  alembic migration and any additional alembic-based migrations
  requested (or any available, if no version is specified). No
  sqlalchemy-migrate-based migrations will ever be applied.

While we continue to allow users to request a specific database
migration version to upgrade to, we *do not* allow them to request a
sqlalchemy-migrate-based migration version. There's no good reason to do
this - the deployment won't run with an out-of-date DB schema (something
that's also true of the alembic migration, fwiw) - and we want to get
people off of sqlalchemy-migrate as fast as possible. A change in a
future release can remove the sqlalchemy-migrate-based migrations once
we're sure that they'll have upgraded to a release including all of the
sqlalchemy-migrated-based migrations (so Wallaby).

Tests are modified to validate the sanity of these operations. They're
mostly trivial changes, but we do need to do some funky things to ensure
that (a) we don't use logger configuration from 'alembic.ini' that will
mess with our existing logger configuration and (b) we re-use connection
objects as necessary to allow us to run tests against in-memory
databases, where a different connection would actually mean a different
database. We also can't rely on 'WalkVersionsMixin' from oslo.db since
that only supports sqlalchemy-migrate [1]. We instead must re-invent the
wheel here somewhat.

The enable_v2_api parameter was deprecated a while ago but the default
defined in cinder is still `True` which means v2 api is still enabled
in cinder-api.

This change re-introduces the enable_v2_api parameter so that users
can set enable_v2_api=False to disable v2 api support in cinder-api.

We have a class of bugs in our current database schema that were
introduced by now-squashed migrations, whereby we applied a new
constraint to a column but forgot to apply the same change to the column
in the shadow table. Currently, we preserve the behavior of these bugs
through use of the 'ALTER' statement. This results in more complex SQL
for the initial migration, however, more importantly, the ALTER
statement is not actually supported by SQLite and the underlying
migration engine must instead mimic behavior by creating a new table
with the updated schema and a temporary name, copy across all data from
the old table to the new table, delete the old table and rename the new
table.

While sqlalchemy-migrate handled this transparently for us, therefore
allowing us to mostly ignore the issue, alembic makes this lack of
support in SQLite explicit by insisting on the 'batch_alter_table'
context manager [1] wrapping any ALTER statements. This is context
manager is ""a little tricky"" (zzzeek's words, not mine) and is therefore
best avoided. Fortunately, this is easily done through the addition of a
couple of checks within the '_create_shadow_tables' helper that simply
modify the affected columns before creating the table.

This patch is the first in a refactor of the cleanup logic in our
tests.

This patch adds a new `cleanup()` method to the SecretClient that
attempts to delete all the secrets it creates.

Moving the responsibility of tracking which secrets to clean up down
to the client allows us more flexibility when cleaning up the resources.
e.g.  it should be fairly easy to clean up secrets across multiple projects
by just calling the new `cleanup()` method on each client used.

This patch will also allow us to get rid of the overloaded `do_request()`
method that is currently used as a proxy to the client to be able to track
entities.

The change also makes the test code more explicit and easier to read.

Currently if you pass in [""provider1:br-ex"", ""provider2:br-ex""] via the
puppet ovn::controller::ovn_bridge_mappings hiera parameter, it
will fail with duplicate declaration errors around the exec because it
is using only the nic 'br-ex' as the resource name. We fix this by
passing both the network and the bridge to the name. The command is
idempotent so no harm is done.

The other place is the ovn::controller::bridge define which will complain
about duplicate declarations. We fix this by just passing the bridge
name directly to the ovn::controller::bridge define and we use
ensure_resource() when creating those definitions to avoid duplicates

1) Deployed a train env with this patch with a composable control plane

The use case here comes from BGP, but can apply to other services
as well:
If an operator does a change to the frr.conf and launches a redeploy
to push those changes out to the overcloud, we do *not* want
that they are applied everywhere at the same time as that would
very likely create a full network partition (especially if
FRR is buggy and its graceful restart misbehaves).

So we introduce a throttle parameter for the tripleo_container_manage
role which is set to 0 (aka no throttle) by default.

Tested this by using it in frr and observed that the container
start task (and the others) was done serially across the overcloud:
---
- hosts: overcloud
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: Start FRR
    include_role:
      name: tripleo_container_manage
    vars:
      tripleo_container_manage_config: ""/var/lib/tripleo-config/container-startup-config/step_0""
      tripleo_container_manage_config_id: ""frr""
      tripleo_container_manage_config_patterns: ""frr.json""
      tripleo_container_manage_clean_orphans: false
      tripleo_container_manage_throttle: 1

With    throttle: real    0m35.262s
Without throttle: real    0m24.582s

Nothing guarantees us that we open up cluster traffic
before we actually start waiting for quorum. So if the
overcloud-image starts off with some rules blocking cluster
traffic we might well open them up too late and so we timeout
waiting for a quorum to be established but that will
never happen due to iptables rules.

Let's make sure and explicity that we open the firewall rules
before pcsd (rhel8) and pacemaker_remote (rhel7) are started.

Tested on Newton and confirmed the rules opened before the service:

This is done so that we can correctly specify multiple notification
drivers. Via puppet-oslo change in If65946412b42e0919456ed92fdd8e3788ad67872
we want to be able to specify multiple drivers for oslo messaging
notification by passing a list.

Let's switch the ini management backend to the ruby backend so we can
correctly have multiple driver= lines.

NB: WIP as I need to do another round of tests (initial tests were fine)

In deployment/nova/novajoin-container-puppet.yaml we call the following to enroll in freeipa:
- name: Enroll to FreeIPA
  command: ipa-client-install -U --password={{ ipa_otp }}
  args:
    creates: /etc/ipa/default.conf
  when: ipa_otp != ''

Now in our documentation for the undercloud
https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/tripleo-docs/latest/deployment/install_undercloud.html
we state that we need to add the following line to /etc/hosts:
127.0.0.1 myhost.mydomain myhost

This will break enrollment in case /etc/hosts has a line like '127.0.0.1
localhost.localdomain localhost' *before* the myhost.. one. That is
because ipa-client-install by default will call python's socket fqdn()
to determine the hostname to send to freeipa and that can potentially
send localhost.localdomain to the freeipa server and the enrollment will
fail with:

  Invalid hostname, 'localhost.localdomain' must not be used.
  The ipa-client-install command failed. See /var/log/ipaclient-install.log for more information

Since it seems to me that we tried to work around this at least in
infrared (see https://review.gerrithub.io/c/redhat-openstack/infrared/+/480005) which
shuffled around the lines in /etc/hosts, I think we can make this more
robust by enrolling with the proper fqdn which we know about.

Closes-Bug: #1862970
WIP as I need to test it

On a fresh install of devstack running on Ubuntu server 18.04.\n\nHere some insights about functionality:\n- Tested creating the instance via horizon and defining the ""console_passwd"" - Ok\n- Tested console access via horizon (with and without password) - Ok\n- Tested updating the ""console_passwd"" metadata via horizon - Ok, but the password is only effectively updated in libvirt afeter a new request for a console. This can cause confusion if the user is using an external agent to access the instance.\n- Tested the change in the nova-API call to change the password - Ok\n\nSome other things to keep in mind:\n- Once the instance is started without a password libvirt won\'t accept to reconfigure it with password protection. The API call return successful but libvirt ignores it until the instance is shutdoff and restarted.\n  The reverse operation is also not possible, starting the instance with password and trying to remove it later doesnt work (until the instance is restarted).\nI believe those are libvirt limitations.\n\nIn regard with the original Blueprint, there is some inconsistency:\nThe blueprint states, under ""Security impact"":\n""(...)""note that console password will only be securely kept by libvirtd and won’t be displayed in the result of virsh dumpxml <instance UUID> or definition XMLs managed by libvirt /qemu in local filesystem except. Briefly speaking, no potential security risks will be introduced.""\nThat\'s partially true: virsh dumpxl do not show the password, but it is written to the libvirt/qemu local filesystem file (i.e /etc/libvirt/quemu/instance-XXXX.xml, and can be read from this file.\nI understand that this is not a limitation and is due to the way this patch implements the Blueprint. This can be improved in the future.\n\nI find this patch very useful for my usage case, in which end-users access the instances via external agent (spice protocol via remote-viewer in my case). Today one user can simply kick/steal another user session from an instance just by connecting to it. This patch would solve this issue (once it implements spice support)- I\'ll try do it on my own but this is my first contact with openstack development.\n\nLast but not least:\n- Had only one simple merging conflict (cause of new API version) - easily fixed\n- The zuul failure is due to an unused variable - easily fixed'}, {'account_id': 26458, 'date': '2020-09-17 06:03:40.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 12:\n\n> \n > I find this patch very useful for my usage case, in which end-users\n > access the instances via external agent (spice protocol via\n > remote-viewer in my case).

The '[vnc] auth_schemes' configuration option is currently used to configure the authentication scheme for the latter, the proxy<->server connection, as discussed in the initial spec [1].  My suggestion to use VeNCrypt+VNC would make sense if we wanted to enable password-based auth for proxy<->server but we don't - we want it for the client<->proxy connection.

This can either be a list similar to the one we currently use for the proxy<->server connection, '[vnc] auth_schemes' (in which case you should rename '[vnc] auth_schemes' to be less generic - perhaps '[vnc] client_auth_schemes' and '[vnc] server_auth_schemes'?), or a simple boolean. I am assuming that it's possible to use different authentication methods on different backends, meaning we can drop the password for the proxy<->server connection. This seems reasonable given we currently support VeNCrypt for proxy<->server but not client<->proxy.\n\nAs an aside, are you testing this?

It's making it so that the vnc server running on the guest will require a password challenge [2] for the client (the proxy) to connect to it.

The deployment setup for this would have to be no TLS between the proxy and instance server. TLS can however be used between the end user client and proxy though.\n\n[4] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/0226f9dd630a29c57a97d0fbc7f98250040c42bb/nova/console/rfb/auth.py#L35\n[5] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/0226f9dd630a29c57a97d0fbc7f98250040c42bb/nova/console/rfb/auth.py#L29""}, {'account_id': 4690, 'date': '2021-03-04 00:19:51.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 37:\n\n> > stephenfin: your steps have no problem. the exception raise from[1], from what i verify, i found the f[2] value depend on the instance has connected the console. the password takes effect after we reboot the guest. as melwitt also says, it is really a problem, we couldnot updateDeviceFlag with `libvirt.VIR_DOMAIN_AFFECT_LIVE`[3], it raise exception `libvirt.libvirtError: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command 'set_password': Could not set password` and just update the guest xml config.\n\nI looked into this more today and learned some things about the vnc password feature in qemu.\n\nLooking at a blog post by the author of the feature, Daniel Berrange [4] and the patch emails [5], it shows that the password feature was part of the first steps of adding authentication support for the vnc server in qemu.

I had been thinking _maybe_ it would be similar to other APIs that will not work depending on which virt driver is configured. Example from a quick look in the code, the trigger crash dump API [1], it returns a 400 if the virt driver does not support it.\n\nI think for live migration it should just keep what it has in its XML: if it has a password, keep it, if it does not have a password, leave it alone. The option would be better named \'require_password_for_new_instances\', that is what I was thinking.\n\n> [sean]i think we would need triat or some other logic at the schduler level to proably supprot the host option.

Also -1 on returning a message saying you must hard reboot. I think both are a poor user experience as you point out. I think if we are going to support vnc passwords, it needs to be an easy/seamless experience for users, and so far I am not seeing that there is any user-friendly way to provide it.\n\nThe closest I could come up with is what I described earlier, but it does feel like config-driven API behavior and having a vnc console default to ""reject all"" if the user has not set a password yet is a poor experience too. I guess for the latter issue we could detect lack of a password in the proxy and give the user an error message indicating they need to reset their password in order to connect. That still leaves us with what might be considered config-driven API behavior.\n\nI agree that I think there are too many problems here to solve this late in the process and without wider discussion. 😞\n\n[1] https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/?expanded=trigger-crash-dump-in-server-detail#trigger-crash-dump-in-server'}, {'account_id': 26458, 'date': '2021-03-05 01:19:38.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 37: Code-Review-1\n\nIn summary, if we want to support reseting password for vnc \n(a)with get_vnc_console API, it must be hard reboot;\n(b)with server create API, it's too intrusive to the VM system;\n(c)with config-driven API behavior, looks better than before options, but it's also not have a good UX for users, the same as give the warning with exceptions.\n\nI think we have to stop working hard on this, as melwitt said, we need an extensive, systematic discussion, how about put this to Xena PTG?""}, {'account_id': 9708, 'date': '2021-03-08 08:23:53.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 37:\n\n> Patch Set 37: Code-Review-1\n> \n> In summary, if we want to support reseting password for vnc \n> (a)with get_vnc_console API, it must be hard reboot;\n> (b)with server create API, it's too intrusive to the VM system;\n> (c)with config-driven API behavior, looks better than before options, but it's also not have a good UX for users, the same as give the warning with exceptions.\n> \n> I think we have to stop working hard on this, as melwitt said, we need an extensive, systematic discussion, how about put this to Xena PTG?\n\nPlease add the topic to the PTG etherpad. \n\nI marked the bp deferred to signal that we need further discussion.""}, {'account_id': 29071, 'date': '2021-06-15 09:39:27.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 37:\n\nany updates on this bp?'}, {'account_id': 15334, 'date': '2021-07-29 11:30:56.000000000', 'content': ""Abandoned\n\nThe spec wasn't approved for Xena and has outstanding issues.

Improving the parsing of the cron schedule for /etc/cron/rabbitmq-stats.
The code makes assumptions that the user in the cron entry will be the
root user, which is generally safe as that's what the charm applied.
However, the parsing is brittle in that it depends on the 'root' string
in the entry. This changes the code so that the cron timer spec is

let's try and add some resilience when we create the workflow execution and not only when we monitor it.

let's try and add some resilience when we create the workflow execution and not only when we monitor it.

let's try and add some resilience when we create the workflow execution and not only when we monitor it.

Usually the source volume would be the same size or smaller
than the destination volume and they must share the same
volume-type. In particular, when the destination volume is
same size as the source volume, creating an encrypted volume
from a snapshot of an encrypted volume truncates the data in
the new volume.

In order to fix this the RBD workflow would be something
like this:
A source luks volume would be 1026M, we write some data
and create a snap from it. We like to create a new luks
volume from a snapshot so the create_volume_from_snapshot()
method performs a RBD clone first and then a resize if needed.

In addition the _clone() method creates a clone
(copy-on-write child) of the parent snapshot. Object size
will be identical to that of the parent image unless specified
(we don't in cinder) so size will be the same as the parent
snapshot.

If the desired size of the destination luks volume is 1G the
create_volume_from_snapshot() won't perform any resize and
will be 1026M as the parent. This solves bug #1922408 because
we don't force it to resize and because of that we don't
truncate the data anymore.

The second case scenario is when we would like to increase
the size of the destination volume. As far as I can tell this
won't face the encryption header problem but we still need to
calculate the difference size to provide the size that the
user is expecting.

That's why the fix proposed calculate the new_size based on:
size difference = desired size - size of source volume
new size = current size + size difference

Ia2007bc63ef09931ea0197cef29d6a5614ed821a unfortunately missed that
resume_state_on_host_boot calls down into _hard_reboot always removing
volume secrets rendering that change useless.

This change seeks to address this by using the destroy_secrets kwarg
introduced by I856268b371f7ba712b02189db3c927cd762a4dc3 within the
_hard_reboot method of the libvirt driver to ensure secrets are not
removed during a hard reboot.

This resolves the original issue in bug #1905701 *and* allows admins to
hard reboot a users instance when that instance has encrypted volumes
attached with secrets stored in Barbican. This latter use case being
something we can easily test within tempest unlike the compute reboot in
bug #1905701.

This change is kept small as it should ideally be backported alongside
Ia2007bc63ef09931ea0197cef29d6a5614ed821a to stable/queens. Follow up
