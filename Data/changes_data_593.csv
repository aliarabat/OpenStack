  degradation (cause we are calling _()), complexity

  doesn't fail instead just writes errors to the logs,
  as well information about trace is lost, so it's super
  hard to fix it

  Log wrapper doesn't allow to use LOG anymore for
  formatting strings

  All places are fixed

- Improve logging of exceptions

LOG.exception() already logs exception, which means it's bad idea to
pass str(e) to it. Instead we should provide clear description of what
happend. Improved few places to write warnings or exceptions in case
of different level of logs. In few places just use LOG.exception

errors_out_migration_ctxt includes a check of the current migration
state.  If the migration is not in either 'migrating' or
'post-migrating', the decorator will not set it to an error state.
This behaviour has been present since the decorator was added in
change Ie752e483. The change does not describe why this restriction is
present and there is no comment, so we can only guess why it exists.

My best guess is that it is a hack to limit the scope of the
decorator. The idea might have been that if the migration status has
been set to some value representing that is has finished or moved to
another host, we should no longer set the migration to an error state
if there is a subsequent error which wouldn't directly affect the
instance.

With changes Id2f352a6 and I9bcc1605 we have removed the necessity for
this by defining the scope in which we should set a migration to error
to the lexical scope of the context manager. We remove this exclusion
as its implementation is obtuse, we have replaced its functionality,
and it makes extending migration code harder.

When I315f9bb78a1296f691dadaeb39fb0a48df1d5f06 got merged the xml files
for fence_ironic were added but the actual manifest that was merged into
manifests/stonith/fence_ironic was manually generated.

That means that there are a bunch of parameters that do not work in the
current release (and probably never have?). For example:
- fence_ironic takes 'password' as an option:
  https://github.com/ClusterLabs/fence-agents/blob/master/fence/agents/ironic/fence_ironic.py#L53).
  But in the manifest we have 'passwd':
  https://github.com/openstack/puppet-pacemaker/blob/master/manifests/stonith/fence_ironic.pp#L85

Since this one and a few other options could never really have worked,
let's just autogenerate the file from xml properly. The xml has the
last word on which parameters work in any case.

Additionally there never has been a released fence-agents-ironic
package, so the package relationship cannot have worked unless the user
created a package himself. In order to fix that we allow a special
package name 'None' to be passed to the autogenerator which will skip
generating the package dependencies.  In this case it is the user's duty
to have the binary on the system.  We can change this back once a
fence-agents-ironic package does get released.

something else were to reference any of them.

Unfortunately when calculating the resource data for a stack (which we
must always do when e.g. showing the outputs), we always include the
reference IDs of all resources, regardless of whether they are referenced
by get_resource in the data we are looking to populate. (In fact, we have
no way from the Template API to distinguish where get_resource is used on
a particular resource, only where there are dependencies on it.) This is no
problem under the assumption that getting the reference ID is quick, but
that assumption does not hold for TemplateResource.

The show_output RPC call only retrieves a single output (as opposed to
show_stack, used in StackResource.get_output(), which calculates all of
them). Fall back to that call in TemplateResource.get_reference_id() if the
outputs are not already cached to avoid unnecessary overhead in the common
case.

Attribute values are now always fetched before the reference ID, so that we
won't end up making two RPC calls in the case where we also need to read
other outputs.

When we show a stack including the outputs, we calculate all of the
resource attributes that are referenced anywhere in the stack. In
convergence, these are either already cached (and therefore fast) or need
to be cached (and therefore the initial slowness will pay off in future).
This isn't the case in the legacy path though, since we are not doing
caching of attributes in the database in that path. So this is
unnecessarily calculating all of the referenced attribute values, which are
potentially very slow to get.

For legacy stacks, only calculate the attribute values needed to show the
outputs.

make it easier to reuse the invocation logic for check objects

Provide a new private function in oslo_policy._checks to evaluate a
check object. This function protects against API changes to the check
classes by inspecting the set of arguments accepted.

Update Enforcer to use the new function instead of invoking checks
directly.

Update the nested check classes (and, or, not) to use the new function
instead of invoking their sub-rules directly.

Update the way mocks were being used in some tests to replace them
with real minimal classes that implement the necessary APIs.

Simplify a few tests that were confirming multiple behaviors (for
example, the result of a compound check as well as the arguments
passed to its nested rules).

Ensure that we have test cases for invoking nested rules that do and
do not accept the new current_rule argument.

replaced by optional parameters in change
I778ab7ec54a376c60f19dcc89fe62fcab6e59e42. However, the '--name' and
'name' arguments in the parser would conflict, resulting in only the
deprecated argument working. Thus, attempting to update the name
on an aggregate using --name would end up doing a PUT with no new
name provided.

Note that there were unit tests for this, but they were not catching
this problem. So, this removes those tests and adds functional tests
to poke it.

	Implemented the fix for bug#1521351 to support the feature of undeleting the account which was marked for deletion for the reaper.

	To undelete the account, the following cURL command would be invoked to undelete the account.
	curl -X PUT -H 'X-account-meta-undelete: true' -H 'X-Auth-Token: <admin_authentication_token>' http://<ip_address>:8080/v1/<name_of_deleted_account>

Docker services are missing the pre-upgrade validation task
in the upgrade_tasks section which verifies if the service
is running before going on with the upgrade.

Also, remove 'when' condition to stop and disable the
service as this is an indenpotent operation. This way
we ensure the service is always stopped and disabled.

If the stack is in a failed state due to a syntax error in
the outputs (which isn't validated before create/update because
of bug #1599114) stack show doesn't work unless you disable output
resolution, so fall back to this behavior when the outputs are
broken, the rest of the stack show output is still available so
lets show that.

fail when it tries to use its admin credentials. Therefore,
the charm should support a fallback in such case were it

- TLS credentials are saved in a non-volatile file system

In
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/cells-count-resources-to-check-quota-in-api
we introduced a new workflow of Quota checks. It is possible that
concurrent requests can pass API layer checks, but blocked by
conductor layer checks.

This can actually trigger user-noticeable API behavior changes:
As an user, previously, If my request is blocked by quota checks, I will
get HTTP 403 response, and no instance records will be left.

After the above mentioned change, it is possible that when my requests
failed at conductor layer Quota check and I got an instance in ERROR
state. And in an busy cloud, users may got a lot of ERROR instances
according to this and the instance number may beyond the limit.

We should at least mention this behavior change in the release note.

sorted() returns a new list that wasn't captured.  Move to the .sort()
function.

It seems the existing unit-test missed this.  Add a new test taken
from the bug which does exhibit a sorting issue.  Also added a
unit-test of just the comparitor for sanity.

As per Ceph docs [1] we should default pg_num and pgp_num to 128 when

This same change was applied to the ceph-ansible profiles with [2].

Also updates the CI environment files to continue using 32 where we

Currently the resource defaults type has a few problems:
1) Calls pcs directly and so will break in case of concurrent
   CIB updates
2) The delete method is broken because it will not expand the
   name of the variable so nothing will be deleted

Move to the common pcs() function which takes care of
1) and also fix 2) as well. Also add the tries/try_sleep parameters
to be passed to the common pcs() function. Let's also add a test
case to cover for this class.

This adds the basic framework for registering and using default policy
rules. Rules should be defined and returned from a module in
karbor/policies/, and then added to the list in
karbor/policies/__init__.py.

The sample file about default policy will be generated as yaml using
cmd 'tox -e genpolicy' in this patch.

A new context.can() method has been added for policy enforcement of
registered rules. It has the same parameters as the enforce() method
currently being used.

There are a number of places on the Nova side where we need to do things
with volume connections like remove an attachment and immediately
reserve a new one. This introduces a potential race where bad things
can happen. To deal with that, we actually want to to create a new
attachment to do a reserve, BEFORE we delete the current attachment.

The problem is that the new Attachment code currently will toggle the
volume status and attach status such that you will then not be able to
remove the attachment in the future, and it also makes things such that
the true state of the volume is not reflected properly.

This patch adds a check on reserve for additional attachments and if
there are attachments for a volume that have the volume as in-use we
don't clear that status during the new reserve call.

When the proxy times out talking to a backend server (say, because it
was under heavy load and having trouble servicing the request), we catch
the ChunkReadTimeout and try to get the rest from another server. The
client by and large doesn't care; there may be a brief pause in the
download while the proxy get the new connection, but all the bytes
arrive and in the right order:

    GET from node1, serve bytes 0 through N, timeout
    GET from node2, serve bytes N through end

When we calculate the range for the new request, we check to see if we
already have one from the previous request -- if one exists, we adjust
it based on the bytes sent to the client thus far. This works fine for
single failures, but if we need to go back *again* we double up the
offset and send the client incomplete, bad data:

    GET from node1, serve bytes 0 through N, timeout
    GET from node2, serve bytes N through M, timeout
    GET from node3, serve bytes N + M through end

Leaving the client missing bytes M through N + M.

We should adjust the range based on the number of bytes pulled from the
*backend* rather than delivered to the *frontend*. This just requires
that we reset our book-keeping after adjusting the Range header.

Having the cache being cleared before the PUT request creates a
fairly big window where the cache can be inconsistent, if a concurrent
GET happens. Let's move the cache clear after the requests to reduce it.

If a task is skipped, the associated variable to be registered is in any

the task is skipped but template_check is registered anyway, as

In multi-tenants scenario, when a user lists all the checkpoints they
created all the checkpoints in the bank are returned. This is problematic
as there is nothing stopping from on project from restoring another's data.
This means that users can use the update\restore mechanism to bypass other
security in OpenStack.

The gate has started failing due to interface detaches timing out.
Examining the logs, it looks like Nova's interface detach retry takes about
6s to run one attempt. Heat, on the other hand, does 10 retries at 0.5s
intervals. So if Nova has to retry then Heat will fail.

Increase Heat's polling interval to make it more likely that if Nova
succeeds, Heat will see it.

Tempest config generator had a wrong logic for the case when there is
only one keystone version is available.

This patch uses the same urls(discovered from the catalog) for keystone
as it is done for the case when we have both keystone v2 and v3.

... but only if we *have* to!

During the initial gather for balance we prefer to avoid replicas on
over-weight devices that are already under-represented in any of it's
tiers (i.e. if a zone has to have at least one, but may have as many of
two, don't take the only replica).  Instead we hope by going for
replicas on over-weight devices that are at the limits of their
dispersion we might have a better than even chance we find a better
place for them during placement!

This normally works on out - and especially so for rings which can
disperse and balance.  But for existing rings where we'd have to
sacrifice dispersion to improve balance the existing optimistic gather
will end up refusing to trade dispersion for balance - and instead get
stuck without solving either!

You should always be able to solve for *either* dispersion or balance.
But if you can't solve *both* - we bail out on our optimistic gather
much more quickly and instead just focus on improving balance.  With
this change, the ring can get into balanced (and un-dispersed) states
much more quickly!

oslo.config is about to support key/value backends to store
configuration parameters, instead of configuration files:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/454897

While some projects might use this new feature (TripleO, etc), we need a
transition to manage the previous data binding in Puppet catalogs and
push the parameters into etcd instead of classic configuration files.

I've been playing with ruby-etcdv3 this week and found some limitations
to the module.
This patch is a very first draft of what could be done today.

On the TODO list:
* Complete the exists? method to make Puppet catalog idempotent when
  managing etcd k/v.
  This task might imply some work in ruby-etcdv3 and/or some etcd/util
  work in openstacklib.
* Refactor the openstack_config provider to not depend on inifile
  anymore.
* Add provider options to configure the etcd url & credentials.
* Write methods that we had with the config file provider (e.g. ensuring
  a parameter is absent, which would be removing the key from etcd).
* Write unit & functional tests.

Add RBAC test for creating a server backup, providing coverage for the
policy action: ""os_compute_api:os-create-backup"".

This patch also:
  - Removes unnecessary setUp from ServerActionsV216RbacTest
    since it does a rebuild server in case something bad
    happened to the server -- but there is only 1 test case
    in the class.
  - Use data_utils.rand_name to create a fake host name for
    evacuate server test to further randomize host name to
    guarantee 404 is thrown which is the desired outcome.

Remove run_as_root as an argument to utils.execute(), in fact

This patch changes the structure of what is returned by the scheduler's
select_destinations() to the conductor, so it touches a lot of the
interfaces between the scheduler and the conductor. Note that the
conductor still sends the same information to the selected compute; that
will change in the next series of patches.

dib is now going to have to be installed explicitly for us to actually
run the gate. the old method of just cloning the repo won't work with
dib v2.

There are other ways to accomplish this but I'm choosing this approach
knowing that it isn't ideal. First, what's the downside? This means
that dib gets installed wherever trove control plane is installed. Is
that necessary, NO. Is it the end of the world, NO.

What are the options?

- do what Octavia did and have a second requirements.txt in a folder
  called diskimage-create. Would this work, yes but we don't have such
  a mechanism right now and nothing would keep this requirements.txt
  file in sync with g-r that I know of.

- hardcode the pip install command somewhere in the devstack
  plugin. yes, this would work but this would also have no ability to
  sync with g-r.

So, while the solution proposed here isn't ideal, it strikes me as not
bad, and much less risk than the other two options.

We also need to figure out where the elements are and fix the path for
disk-image-create.

Some pep8 failures appears to have crept in as well, those are
addressed.

Currently, attempting to use Trusty (14.04) VMs causes VMs to not
provision correctly due to a grub-install error.  With respect to this
specific issue, this commit updates vm.preseed.j2 by removing some
grub-installer options which were not present before the ansible
rewrite.

Secondly, with that change in place, VMs do not come online on their
10.0.236 addresses as something is overwriting
/etc/networking/interfaces, which wipes out the source of the
/etc/network/interfaces.d directory.  Bug [1] seems to indicate this
is in fact an issue and has been resolved, however attempts at using
this preseed option (netcfg/target_network_config) were not successful.
As a workaround, we simply chattr +i the interfaces file in
vm-post-install-script.sh.j2, and then remove the attr in
deploy-vms.yml when the instance is up an accessible.

The goal of this commit is to test the following projects:
- openstack/puppet-openstack-integration
- openstack/puppet-nova

These two projects, by themselves, provide a fairly comprehensive
set of jobs which represents a good sample to test the migration
results with.
Beaker jobs, puppet-openstack-integration scenarios, unit tests,
lint tests, release notes jobs, a tripleo job, etc.

Ultimately, we're talking about:
- 2 projects
- 33 jobs (and their legacy playbooks)
- 11 project templates

The generated content for these were provided verbatim by the migration
script, only two modifications were made:
1) jobs were set to non-voting
2) added required-projects since puppet-openstack jobs rely on
   ""zuul-cloning"" each other a lot.

The smoke test that ran the CLI command ""acl delete""
with a null entity_ref was failing with an exception
in the cliff library.  This test is invalid, since
the CLI parser would not accept this command without
an entity_ref.

This test failed more gracefully with cliff 2.3.0, but
in 2.4.0 cliff throws an exception that causes this
test to start failing.

This patch is needed in stable/newton to prevent gate
failures, since upper constraints are not set.

This PS fixes an AttributeError being raised in ServerActionsRbacTest
[0] due to a recent Tempest change [1]. Besides, the volume
creation was being done manually in Patrole, when the volume
should have been created using Tempest's base helper for creating
a volume.

This same issue applies with `test_create_image_volume_backed` in
the same class [2] due to a recent Tempest change [3], and besides
that, the previous way of spinning up a volume-backed server did
not leverage Tempest's helpers, which this PS corrects.

Added changes to LVM driver to support NVMe target CLI.
A new target, NVMET, is added for the LVM driver, and allows
cinder to use nvmetcli in order to create/delete subsystems

By choosing iscsi_helper as nvmet, other parameters can be configured
too in cinder.conf like nvmet_port_id, nvmet_ns_id (for namespace) and
nvmet_subsystem_name. The target IP and port, that will be used by
nvmecli OS-brick’s NVMe connector, are taken from iscsi_ip_address
and iscsi_port in cinder.conf for now.

Allowing to globally modify service configuration can be perform too,
but it can be done in 3 different manners, all not documented:
- /etc/kolla/config/global.conf
- /etc/kolla/config/database.conf
- /etc/kolla/config/messaging.conf

database.conf and messaging.conf seems redundant with global.conf.
In order to simplify codebase it seems logical to remove them.

Documentation has been added for overriding configuration globally and
release note has been added too.

When a memecached server goes offline in the middle of a

leaves an ""IndexError: list index out of range"" stacktrace.

This change corrects that in all the places of MemcacheRing

regression.

Every day Rally step by step closer to the point where Rally is going to be
generic framework and it would be possible to split Rally & Rally OpenStack Plugins

One of the blockers for doing this is certification & samples directories and
their contents. Current apporach creates a lot of confusion:

- Rally Users are running samples against production
- Rally samples are actually not that usefull, because creating from them
  tasks takes a lot of time
- Rally Users don't know what certification task is and how to use it
- Samples are hard to ship/find in packaged way (when rally is installed)
- Samples are going to be impossible to ship after the split
- We have to keep hunderds of yaml/json files in actual state
  in our repo (extra work for developers)

Proposed approach is to:

- Create mechansim CLI command that generates samples using plugin names
- Rename certification -> tasks
- Put in tasks directory pre created and tested tasks for different use cases:
  key performance metrics, functional testing, load testing of key functionality,
  ha Testing
- Remove samples as they are not needed anymore

We want to leave the healtchecks in place in the containers, but not

in tripleo, the healtchecks run even if the intended service is not.

Horizon is a web application that is distributed between the web
server, and the web browser. If the web server is upgraded while
the application is still running on the web browser, unusual issues
can creep up.

This patch allows for an haproxy based frontend container to be
created that, through kolla config options, allows multiple horizon
backends to be defined, browsers to be temporarily bound to the
versions they initially landed on, and new horizons introduced for
testing and promotion to default.

This patch adds the enable-qos option to the charm. If enable-qos is
set then neutron.services.qos.qos_plugin.QoSPlugin is added to
service_plugins in neutron.conf locally. The
neutron-plugin-api-relation has also been updated to send the
enable-qos option to charms connected over that relation (for
example neutron-openvswitch and neutron-gateway).

As part of this some of the logic for setting service_plugins was
removed from the neutron.conf and placed in the NeutronCCContext.

This patch is based on the steps in:

This patch does quite a few things to improve the performance of the
CentOS tasks:

1) Configures RDO repos as repositories rather than reinstalling an
   RPM each time.
2) GPG keys are only installed if they're needed.
3) Yum repo configs are carefully modified if they already exist
   which avoids removing deployer configurations.
4) Repo priorities are now set in one shot.

Backport was adjusted to fix a merge conflict in pre_install_yum.yml.

The test_resize_server_error_and_reschedule_was_failed notifiation sample
test only waits for the instance to go to ERROR state and then asserts that
two notifications are emitted. However the second notification,
compute.exception, only emited after the instance is put into ERROR state.
This makes the test unstable.

This patch makes the test stable by waiting for the compute.exception
notification to arrive before asserting the received notifications.

- use simple backend header instead of an override header
  to send the shard container path to the backend obj server
  because we're not actually overriding any existing header

- name the header X-Backend-Container-Path because that is a
  little more generic than mentioning shard, and it relates to
  the existing X-Container-Partition etc

- rename _get_container_meta -> _get_update_target because it
  doesn't get container meta :) (as in user meta, sysmeta) and
  make it include just the shard path in the return tuple

For better UX ""Migration Policy"" param value is set to
""On Demand"" by default in Horizon for volume retype feature.

Volume retype will enable a user to change a volume's type after its creation.

Migrating the volume will be necessary if:
1. The volume's current host cannot handle the new type
2. The volume's driver cannot change the type

The ""Migration Policy"" is only used if the volume retype
cannot be completed. If the ""Migration Policy"" is ""On Demand"",
the back end will perform volume migration.

run as part of the image building process. This change sets
70-remove-machine-id to be executable so that /etc/machine-id will
actually be removed from the images during the building process.
Additionally this changes the element to clear the file rather than
delete it as if the file is missing, things may not work as expected.

The mission of Blazar project[1] is to provide resource reservations
in OpenStack clouds for virtual resouces and physical resources.

Blazar ensures cloud users can deploy their resources during specific time
frames, using reservations.  Blazar creates reservations when it recieves
requests from cloud users about future usages of resources. It finds
out if the clouds can accommodate the usage requests in the reservation
time frame.  A request can define reservations of various kinds of
resources, such as virtual resources (Nova instances or Cinder volumes)
as well as physical resources (Nova hypervisor or Cinder storage).

The features of Blazar are interesting varied kind of OpenStack clouds users,
such as Scientific WGs and Enterprise as well as OPNFV Promise. The active
team members are coming from each area, and its development cycle is
neutral for all area.  Additionally, Blazar tends to solve some problems
described in the user story[2] defined by the Product WGs.

The development cycle of the team is following OpenStack patterns.
The team think operator feedbacks are much important to improve Blazar
project and its community. So the priorities for each cycle have been
decided based on not only development requests but operator feedbacks.

The Blazar code is not implemented from scratch by the current active
members. Blazar project was founded at the Icehouse cycle, but inactive
between Kilo and Newton.  At Barcelona Summit, the current members,
some are the real users of Blazar in production and others are operators
of NFV who need Blazar, gathered and started to revive Blazar project.

Blazar project and the team follow the 4 opens:
* Open Source:
  The Blazar source code[3], specifications[4] and documentation[5] are
  completely open source. All are released under the Apache 2.0 licence.

* Open Design:
  The team openly works for all activities. For release milestones, the team
  discussed problems Blazar was facing, work items the team was targeting,
  and project's priorities in etherpad[6], [7]. Additionally, the team had
  meetings in both PTG[7] and Boston Summit[8].

* Open Development:
  All Blazar code is reviewed and hosted in OpenStack CI[9]. The CI
  supports unit tests and Tempest scenario test. All blueprint and bugs
  are tracked by Launchpad[10].

* Open Community:
  All new design and bugs are open in Blazar Launchpad[10]. The team
  weekly IRC meeting[11] is held in a IRC channel for OpenStack projects
  and #openstack-blazar channel is open to everyone who want to discuss
  Blazar-related topics.
