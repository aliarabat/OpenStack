If the hostname has a dash the percona root user set-up will fail.
Also re-running the script fails at the installation of MySQL
since Percona has changed that and it is now not backward compatible,
for this reason the user has to remove all the installed packages.

Ubuntu Liberty packaging (still considered as unstable) is currently
broken for neutron package [1]

The package works for centos7 so we still have beaker jobs running
RDO trunk, so in the meantime Ubuntu fix the package, let's set it
non-voting to unblock our CI.

This patch is temporary and will probably be reverted as soon Ubuntu
provides stable enough packages for Neutron and other broken
services.

Note: if more broken packages appear in Ubuntu Liberty Staging, we will
probably stop voting on trusty platform.

The flake8 C901 was also added to the tox.ini to be ignored. This error

With the addition of hash generation to enforce object versioning
updates to Magnum (see I586f73570dc7b65c83b216d09d11e8dba3c63b2c), most
of the hash generation was just a copy across from Nova. This can be
isolated out here and can be used as helpers in other projects.

In the unit tests of the project using this helper, a
VersionUpdateHelper would be created with the project's object registry,
and also statically generated fingerprints of the existing objects. A
test is then added with the following to test object updates:

    def test_version_updates(self):
        helper = MyVersionUpdateHelper()
        args = helper.get_fingerprint_assertion_args()
        self.assertEqual(*args)

This then tests the generated fingerprints of the current state of
objects and tests them against the static fingerprints in the helper
class. The args returned by get_fingerprint_assertion_args() even
includes an error message to aid developers in how to update the
versions and fingerprints of the objects when things have changed.

The helper class also includes a method
get_additional_version_update_attrs() that can be overridden to add more
attributes on which to add into the fingerprint. If any of these
additional attributes are changed in objects, it will also update the
fingerprint and notify a version update is needed. (ex: Nova uses
child_versions.items() as another attribute on which to update the
version).

Because this is just a helper, all of this is opt-in. If users of
oslo_versionedobjects do not want to test against generated
fingerprints, they do not have to use this helper.

WSME 0.8.0 adds strict data validation checking. This includes
disallowing any attribute which is not defined in the API data
model to be passed in POST/PUT calls.

We were passing extra attributes, such as trigger_uri for
assembly creation, base_url for language_pack creation,
and plan_uri for component creation. Due to this the tests,
and cli-based user interactions are failing.

This patch fixes above three issues.

For assembly creation tests, we remove the trigger_uri from
the test data as we don't need to pass it anyways.

For language_pack creation, we add the base_url to base types.
The base_url is passed as part of the request body for POST/PUT
when we use the solum cli. Internally this is happening due to
solum cli using the OpenStack common cli which treats the
base_url as one of the keyword arguments and sends all the
kwargs as part of the POST/PUT body.

So probably the right fix here is to modify the OpenStack
common cli to not pass base_url as part of the body. But until
that is done, a workaround is to add the base_url to the list
of attributes to be expected on the API side. That is what we
are doing.

For component creation tests, we add the plan_uri to the component
data model. We are not familiar with the CAMP component data
model to make a call of whether adding a plan_uri to the data
model makes sense or not. I tried removing the plan_uri from
the data that is sent as part of the tests.
That fixed few failing tests, but there
were at least three which were still failing. I have not looked
in details why those remaining tests are failing. But adding
plan_uri on the component API data model seems to make all
tests to pass. So that is what we are doing.

If a node is in cleaning and an error occurs during the heartbeat
handler, the cleaning_error_handler is not always called (e.g. if
Ironic cannot reach the agent). This means the network
is not torn down properly and the clean_step is not reset. Fix the
error message that is set in last_error when an error occurs during
cleaning.

This is a first commit os new  murano testing framework.
This commit adds base io.murano.test.testFixture class.
All test classes are suppossed to be inherited from that class.
Test runner accepts only such kind of classes.
Also test cases should start with the 'test' prefix.
setUp method executes before each test case and tearDown - after.

To run tests, authorization params should be provided or murano config file.
Test runner params have a higher priority than the corresponding
params in config.
Package to test is a required parameter.
It's also allowed to specify class to execute tests in or
to specify test case name.
New murano-test-runner was added.

To run all tests from package, execute the following command:
murano-test-runner -p io.murano.test.MyTest1  -l /package/location/directory

node count update from the Kubernetes template. By doing so, we
require all templates to output a new value 'node_count'. It is up
to the template to determine what that value is.

The point behind the addition of the stevedore.sphinxext extension is
""to document drivers and other types of plugins to make the available
sets built into projects easier to discover""(dhellman). For the heat 
project, since there are so many plugins that need documentation, 
we discussed having the initial/parent patch be the enabling 
of the extension alone, then following up with individual patches 
that add the appropriate documentation to each plugin that requires it.
The next patch in the set will be one of the plugins that needs 
documentation, and it will depend on this patch that enables the 
extension.

(Patch set #3 for the multiple-ipv6-prefixes blueprint)

Provides support for adding multiple IPv6 subnets to an internal router
port. The limitation of one IPv4 subnet per internal router port
remains, though a port may contain one IPv4 subnet with any number of
IPv6 subnets.

This changes the behavior of both the router-interface-add and
router-interface-delete APIs. When router-interface-add is called with
an IPv6 subnet, the subnet will be added to an existing internal port
on the router with the same network ID if the existing port already has
one or more IPv6 subnets. Otherwise, a new port will be created on the
router for that subnet. When calling the router-interface-add with a
port (one that has already been created using the port-create command),
that port will be added to the router if it meets the following
conditions:

        1. The port has no more than one IPv4 subnet.
        2. If the port has any IPv6 subnets, it must not have the same
           network ID as an existing port on the router if the existing
           port has any IPv6 subnets.

If the router-interface-delete command is called with a subnet, that
subnet will be removed from the router port to which it belongs. If the
subnet is the last subnet on a port, the port itself will be deleted
from the router. If the router-interface-delete command is called with
a port, that port will be deleted from the router.

This change also allows the RADVD configuration to support advertising
multiple prefixes on a single router interface.

This patch is a combination of two patches committed to master as the
first patch on its own results in continual gate check fails:

Patch 1:

Removed default lxc profile on container create

Having the lxc container create role drop the lxc-openstack apparmor
profile on all containers anytime its executed leads to the possibility
of the lxc container create task overwriting the running profile on a given
container. If this happens its likley to cause service interruption until the
correct profile is loaded for all containers its effected by the action.

To fix this issue the default ""lxc-openstack"" profile has been removed from the
lxc contianer create task and added to all plays that are known to be executed
within an lxc container. This will ensure that the profile is untouched on
subsequent runs of the lxc-container-create.yml play.

Closes-Bug: 1487130
(cherry picked from commit ffb701f8a3a325e0c321fb2d3e37eea25e66a8af)

Patch 2:

Wait for container ssh after apparmor profile update

This patch adds a wait for the container's sshd to be available
after the container's apparmor profile is updated. When the
profile is updated the container is restarted, so this wait is
essential to the success of the playbook's completion.

It also includes 3 retries which has been found to improve the
rate of success.

Due to an upstream change in behaviour with netaddr 0.7.16 we
need to pin the package to a lower version until Neutron is
adjusted and we bump the Neutron SHA.

Currently, We can't delete instance system metadata after instance
is deleted because of following reason:
1) We might have 'changed-since' request which will access
the soft deleted system_metadata
2) We might has period audit function which also access the
soft deleted system_metadata

The root cause is the join function filtered the 'deleted'
data of system metadata and it lead to ValueError later.

Conceptually the system metadata is associated with instance,
it will be used in instance's lifecycle, the data will only
be updated so we won't have 2 copies or more system_metadata
for the same instance.
So allow to read it even if it's deleted is safe.

This patch load the system_metadata from db when instance is
in deleted state to avoid can't delete system_metadata issue.

After an update notification, Glance images do not seem
to be searchable. If you filter by the name of the updated
image it will not show up. However, if you re-index, it
will be searchable.

This is due to the code currently indexing a wrapper ""doc""
object around the actual doc. This was inadvertantly left
in when switching from doc as upsert.

Previously this only would only occur once on bootstrap. There is
some sequence that was either stopping this from occurring, or it was
becoming reowned by root.

I haven't fully nailed down why this happens but a reasonable workaround
seems to be to just always ensure correct ownership on start by moving
the existing chown outside the set_rabbitmq_cookie function. The
recursive option seems to be unneeded so remove this to be less
invasive.

This patch adds a wait for the container's sshd to be available
after the container's apparmor profile is updated. When the
profile is updated the container is restarted, so this wait is
essential to the success of the playbook's completion.

It also includes 3 retries which has been found to improve the
rate of success.

Due to an upstream change in behaviour with netaddr 0.7.16 we
need to pin the package to a lower version until Neutron is
adjusted and we bump the Neutron SHA.

In the current spec, well defined capabilities have 'cinder_'
prefix.
However, instead of adding 'cinder_' to well defined capabilities,
using vendor name + colon(:) as a prefix for vendor unique
capabilities and using without prefix for well defined capabilities
are more reasonable, because admin can understand which vendor
provides these capabilities in one glance.

This patch fixes these definition in the current spec.

Most backend assignment listing is planned to become based on
list_role_assignments. As such this method needs to be tested with
a myriad of different options. We want to avoid having acres of
test code or using complex test algorithms (which often mirror
the code under test) making it difficult to easily determine what
exactly is being tested. Ideally what you want is the ability to
write some kind of data driver shorthand for these tests, which
allows testers and reviewers to see ""at a glance"" if a test scenario
is appropriate and comprehensive.

This patch implements the basic code for a TestHelper that provides
the above by allowing a test to simply be a dict-based test plan.
A few examples of its use are also included. Subsequent patches will

- Add support for effective and inherited options
- Replace existing assignment tests with data-driven test plans and
  add additional tests to widen our coverage.

This patch proposes the following changes
to the 'available' volume:
* Add the --lock-volume flag to cinder migrate
The default value is False, which means the migration is aborted
if the owner of the volume issues commands like attach
or detach during the volume migration. The volume will be in
'available' during migration.
If it is set to True, the migration of this volume will not be
aborted by other commands. The volume will be in 'maintenance'
during migration.

* List migration status for all the volumes
The attribute migration_status will be listed, if the request
is issued by an admin. Otherwise, the migration_status will not
be listed. The option migration_status is added for the admin
to filter the volumes returned via 'cinder list' command.

A simple test case of running glance image-list in a loop fails on

Authentication fails, possibly because a different keystone serves
up a second request after a first request is handled.  The second
keystone doesn't have the keystone token needed to do the job.  This
patch changes all the API services to follow the same path through
the network.  This is based upon the upstream HA guide here:

http://docs.openstack.org/high-availability-guide/content/ha-aa-haproxy.html

The change specifically does the following as specified in the
HA Proxy documentation:

    he source IP address is hashed and divided by the total
    weight of the running servers to designate which server will
    receive the request. This ensures that the same client IP
    address will always reach the same server as long as no
    server goes down or up.

This function is a method of ComputeAPI, so its callers must have an

not need to call ComputeAPI by other reason.

Besides this function does not use any of the class members. So there is
no reason for it to be the class method.

This patch moves this function to compute.utils because it does not use

CentOS version of debootstrap creates a broken /dev: /dev/fd is a
directory rather than a symlink to /proc/self/fd. This breaks programs
which make use of /dev/fd/$N. One of such programs is bash. As a result
packages which use bash in their pre- or postinstallation scripts fail
to install into the bootstrap image being built.

To solve the problem make sure /dev/fd is a proper symlink. While at it
create the basic device nodes (/dev/null, /dev/zero, /dev/random, etc)
if they are missing.

Currently ini-style conf files require explicit templates. This has a
number of downsides in terms of maintenance and configurability.

This commit adds a role to the project for generating a conf file based
on a generic template.

The template requires the ansible variables be named using a specific
format:

prefix__confsection__confvariable: confvariablevalue

For example:

  nova_conf__DEFAULT__verbose: true

__ is the default separator, it is used to split the ansible variable
into the parts for use in the template.

Ansible variables are only allowed to contain [a-zA-Z0-9_]. In most
cases that is sufficient however there a conf files where section names
contain other characters e.g. ':' or '-'. This means there needs to be a
way to allow them to be inserted when required. The role will allow
mappings to be specified for the purpose.

An example of how an option in the swift.conf file would be handled:

  swift_conf__swift__hyphen__hash__swift_hash_path_prefix = ""changeme""

The prefix is swift_conf, swift__hyphen__hash is the section in the conf
file, swift_hash_path_prefix is the option name and ""chanageme"" is the
value.

The config Ansible vars must be found in hostvars[inventory_hostname]
but they may reference vars not found in there.

The user is enabled to choose between entering a network address
manually or to allocate a network address from a pool. With the
advent of address scopes in Neutron this feature will be used for
enabling routing of globally unique addresses (GUA) all the way in
to the VM. This is a prerequisite for IPv6 to be routable, and will
also at some point allow GUA-IPv4 without NAT.

Workflow:
If subnet allocation is not supported in backend, there are no
subnet pools available, or the user chooses to enter network address
manually the form will behave like before.

If subnet allocation is supported in backend and there either are
subnet pools available or the label for the default subnet pool(s) is
configured, the user may choose to allocate a network address from a
pool. The user will be presented with two new drop-down menus. The
first drop-down menu will, in addition to the default pool (if
configured), present the names and prefixes of available pools. The
next drop-down menu will display available choices for prefix lengths
(it will not be displayed if the ""default pool"" is selected). The
available choices are defined by the subnet pool. Default prefix length
defined by the pool will be selected. The correct IP version is used
based on what IP version is defined by the selected subnet pool.

The ""Create Subnet"" checkbox has been moved from the Subnet step to
the first step of the workflow. This is because of how switchable
fields work, and how you can not safely define more than one slug in a
fields ""switch-on"" attribute. For the sake of User Experience, we need
to reliably switch fields based on selected Address source on the
Subnet tab. IMHO it also makes more sense to have this checkbox on the
first step of the workflow, if you just want to create a network you can
now uncheck the ""Create Subnet"" checkbox and click directly on ""Create"".

true. Instead when configuring tempest we should look at all the
possible services that tempest could know about, which will let us
disable services we don't have support for.

problem without this implementation is a simple overwrite where

Nova v2.1 API is CURRENT API now, and Nova v2 API is SUPPORTED API.
So the gate should test Nova v2.1 API by default instead of Nova v2 API.

This commit makes Nova v2.1 API as default API by changing the ""catalog_type""
value to ""computev21"".

Nova v2 API is still SUPPORTED API, so the gate needs to test it also.
For that nova v2 jobs can set catalog_type to ""compute"".
(Current job ""tempest-dsvm-nova-v21-full"" is going to be changed to
""tempest-dsvm-nova-v20-full"" for v2 API testing.

The multiple table files actually made it more difficult to see
the whole picture of the table. You would have to have multiple files
open to correlate the column headers, column data, and details sections.

Future patches can add additional helper directives to simplify this
even further.

Also removed batch actions and row actions from table. We will
introduce them back as we add each action back in.

Ubuntu Liberty packaging (still considered as unstable) is currently
broken for keystone package.

Since keystone is the common project used by any other modules, we can't
get stuck until they fix the package.
The pacakge works for centos7 so we still have beaker jobs running on
RDO trunk, so in the meantime Ubuntu fix the package, let's set it as
non-voting so it will unblock our CI.

This patch is temporary and will probably be reverted as soon Ubuntu
provides stable enough packages for Keystone and other broken services.

It's a good practice to add whitespace in expressions to enhance
readability of code such as:

ugly and inconsistent looking code such as:

Require Radix Parameter (radix)

When using the parseInt() function it is common to omit the second
argument, the radix, and let the function try to determine from the
first argument what type of number it is. By default, parseInt() will
autodetect decimal and hexadecimal (via 0x prefix). Prior to
ECMAScript 5, parseInt() also autodetected octal literals, which
caused problems because many developers assumed a leading 0 would be
ignored.

we can enforce certain requirements on plugin loaders such that only

Change options requirement testing so that it is performed on the base
load_from_options method. This will mean it gets shared between all
loading mechanisms.

I removed the verify_auth function because it is a bit too specific to
the OSC/OCC case. auth_type is not something that is part of
keystoneauth. I also modified the exception as it should no longer take
the plugin name as this would be knowledge any calling function has.

OSC/OCC could use this function to implement a higher level error
message, but I think it should be keystoneauth's responsibility to
validate auth plugins and they should just offload the options.

Instances will currently alternate between
BUILD->ACTIVE->BUILD->ACTIVE on create. This was
happening because a race condition existed between
the datastore sending heartbeats that the service is
ACTIVE before and the prepare call manually stopping
the service to bring the status back to BUILD.

The fix is to add an optional param force to set_status
that is going to be set to True for end_install_or_restart
which is called at the end of prepare for all datastores either
directly or through app.complete_install_or_restart(). When
set_status is called it will now check if the instance status
was currently BUILDING and if the force flag is False. This
means that the prepare call has not yet finished and to skip
the heartbeat from updating the status. Once prepare is finished
it will call complete_install_or_restart which will in turn
call end_install_or_restart and force the status to be updated
from BUILD to ACTIVE. If setting status to FAILED or
BUILD_PENDING it will never skip the heartbeat.

For mongodb I added complete_install_or_restart to service.py
to be called at the end of prepare for single instance mongo
instead of calling set_status directly to RUNNING.

Cleaned up BaseDbStatusTests and added new tests covering new
logic.

When creating a volume from an image, cinder copies the image metadata
into volume properties. When booting from the volume, we read this
metadata from the volume and use it as image metadata once again.

While fixing the check against min_ram,
change I861a78b5c7efa71e4bf7206d388b8d0d8048c78e introduced a
regression which prevents a user from booting a volume which is larger
than the flavor's disk. As we are not creating this disk, this check
does not make sense. Similarly, it checks the image metadata's
min_disk against the flavor disk size, which is not being used.

This change leaves the image metadata check unaltered when creating a
flavor disk. When booting from a volume, we check min_disk from image
metadata against the actual size of the volume. We don't check the
volume size at all. The check against min_ram is retained unaltered.

This is a request to add the App Catalog to the OpenStack
namespace.  The Community App Catalog is a collection of
ready-to-use applications, Heat templates and machine images, and
other OpenStack components that you can immediately deploy into
your OpenStack cloud.

The project was  developed in coordination with the OpenStack
Foundation, and is hosted by OpenStack Infra at
http://apps.openstack.org.  This project is already using all of
the OpenStack infrastructure and services and is gated through
gerrit.

We are using the both the Dev and Operators mailing list, and
bring up initiatives on the mailing lists in order to provide
ample opportunity for those in the community to provide feedback,
and so everyone can be kept aware of our progress and intentions.
We also hold weekly IRC meetings[1] which are announced
regularly, and logged for review.

The IRC channel #openstack-app-catalog is logged[2], and active
with community members, core developers and like minded people
all helping and discussing issues within the project as well as
questions that come up from using the App Catalog or adding
content to it.

Christopher Aedo has been acting as the temporary PTL, and has
been actively working with the App Catalog since before it was
officially launched at the Vancouver summit. We plan to hold an
official PTL election before the Tokyo summit.

This commit is a formal request to add the Community App Catalog
into the OpenStack namespace as an official project.

There's a corner case where password may be requested twice. In a fresh
environment, when schemas have not be downloaded for v2, the client will
ask for a password to download the schemas and then it'll ask for the
password again to run the actual command. This happens because we parse
the CLI arguments twice to make sure we're parsing them for the right
client version.

This patch checks if the password is unset in the newly parsed arguments
and if it's been set in the previously parsed ones. In this case it
keeps the set password. I believe this approach is safer than re-using
the already parsed arguements which may have been parsed for a different
API version (might happen because we fallback to v1 if v2 is not
available).

If someone tries to execute a command on a locked instance, we want them to
get the more explicit ""Instance <uuid> is locked"" message instead of the
more generic ""Instance <uuid> is in an invalid state for <action>"" message.

exception.InstanceIsLocked is a subclass of exception.InstanceInvalidState,
so we need to check for the more specific case first.

The Hyper-V driver uses the Microsoft\Windows\SMB WMI namespace
in order to handle SMB shares. The issue is that this namespace is
not available on Windows versions prior to Windows Server 2012.

For this reason, the Hyper-V driver fails to initialize on Windows
Server 2008 R2.

This patch fixes the issue by properly handling the PathUtils
initialization.

Nova Hyper-V driver fails to detach virtual hard disks when using
the virtualizaton v1 WMI namespace. This affects Windows Server
2008 as well as Windows Server 2012 when the old namespace is used.

The reason is that it cannot find the attached resource,
using the wrong resource object connection attribute.

This patch fixes the issue by using the right resource connection
attribute when attempting to find an attached virtual disk resource
by its path.

Signing requests are expected to arrive at

/v1/sign/<registration_authority>

now. Virtual registration authority is a new concept which right now includes
everything the original configuration included. That means for example each
registration authority available within Anchor deployment can configure its own
CA, auth, and validators. Clients request a specific registration authority via
the URL. This does not mean they can just choose who signs the CSR - they still
need to pass all checks. Only the guesswork of ""which validation set applies to
them"" is gone because of this change.

The previous concept of validator sets is gone. Each registration authority
configures its own validators and all of them need to pass.

Previous endpoint /sign will not work anymore. It's incompatible with
the new design.

The configuration file changes in the following way:
1. Registration authorities need to be defined in the main config.
2. Validator sets are not available anymore.
3. CA and auth settings at the top level need to be named. They can be referred
   to in the registration authority block.
4. Old names are removed. Any use of ""auth"", ""ca"", or ""validators"" at the top
   level will result in an error and explanation regarding the upgrade path.

Further documentation and a sample config with the new layout can be found in
the docs/configuration.rst file.

If an event comes in that does not have a associated router_id, we attempt
to call out to neutron to resolve it by tenant_id and cache it locally on
the TenantRouterManager instance. This happens during get_state_machines()
and, if a router could not be found, the event msg effectively gets dropped.

This is a bit of a waste of Neutron calls if the event happens to be one
that would be ignored later on by the worker (for global or tenant debug,
for example)

This moves that caching out to the worker using a dumb in-memory dict based
cache (we could back this by memcache and improve it if it ends up being
beneficial)  Instead of having the TRM decide to drop messages with no
associated router, we move that responsibility up to the worker where its
already doing similar things around debug modes.  Ensuring the worker has
visibility of the router_id at all times will later let it use this as a
hash key when RUGs are managed using a distributed hash ring.

The Monasca API states that dimensions may not begin with an underscore;
as such no dimensions should be returned that begin with an underscore,
even if they are in the database.

This issie was exposed by new behaviour in InfluxDB 0.9.0 which resulted
in a _key column always being included in returned output. This feature
is scheduled to be removed in 0.9.3, (see
https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/3076) but monasca-api should still
be robust against this behaviour.

There were several examples showing passing an
exception in as the message text to a call to
LOG.exception. LOG.exception will automatically
log the exception details, so doing something
like this results in the exception information
being written out twice.

To prevent the possibility of someone seeing these
examples and assuming that is the correct way to
use LOG.exception, examples have been updated to
use LOG.error instead to illustrate the correct
way to pass in exceptions in the message string.
