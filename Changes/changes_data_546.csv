Kubernetes 1.6.x supports new authorization mode - RBAC. To support it
in OpenStack-Helm we need to make sure that entrypoint init container is
authorizing with role that allows to query k8s API to get endpoints,
pods, services, jobs and daemonsets. This commit implements it by adding
ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, ServiceAccount and Secret for each
of the service that uses k8s-entrypoint. The secret is then mounted to
k8s-entrypoint init container so that it can query Kubernetes API.

Please note that creating ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, ServiceAccount
and Secret for each service is necessary in order to support having
each of the service in different namespace (which is the end goal, but
even now, Ceph is created in a separate namespace than rest of the
services). If only one Secret was created, it could be only attached to
the service which is in the same namespace as Secret's namespace. This
also enforces to use one ServiceAccount per service as Secret is always
connected to the ServiceAccount (they must be in the same namespae).
When it comes to ClusterRole - this resource is not namespaced so it may
have been created only once, but in such case we would need to add
additional chart that would need to be installed before any any other
chart what would increase complexity of installation.

Services: Keystone, Ceph, Glance, Gnocchi and Ingress query Kubernetes API
independently and thus they required additional Service Accounts, Roles,
Secrets and Roles Bindings.

When generating CNI container our scripts were applying two patches to
the Kuryr codebase. One was making sure k8s_client will correctly split
WATCH responses with b""\n"" and second was patching cni.main to enable
daemonized mode for os_vif's privsep instead of sudo/rootwrap mode.

This was critically unmaintainable, as any changes to patched files might
make the patches unapplyable and break the container building scripts.

This commit resolves the problem by completely removing step of applying
patches:
* k8s_client patch is applied directly into the codbase as it's a no-op
  in Python 2.7 and in Python 3.5 should be a correct way of doing
  things.
* cni.main patch gets removed completely, as CNI container is run with
  sudo privileges, so privsep in rootwrap/sudo mode will work fine (and
  maybe even better as it gets rid of ""broken pipe"" errors in kubelet
  logs).

visualizing metrics with (unpatched) Grafana 4.

Similar to its companion change in stable/ocata

not make it into stable/pike upstream due to stable/pike being

We may want to load balance to existing services that we aren't managing
via ansible. Currently the hosts have to exist in the inventory in order
to add a VIP for these hosts, this patch adds the ability to set the
hostnames and addresses of the hosts manually when they aren't in the
ansible inventory.

Additionally, this patch adds a test for both the group method and the
host_lists method.

Archive deleted instances first moves deleted rows to the shadow
tables and then deletes the rows from the original tables.
However, because it does 2 different selects (to get the rows to
insert and to delete) we can have the case that a row is not inserted
in the shadow table but removed from the original. This can happen
when there are new deleted rows between the insert and delete.

This patch fixes this by explicitly deleting only those IDs that were
inserted.

The locations of the previously included templates have been
moved to the standard location used in all other roles. This
helps to allow the sources-branch-updater script be able to
automatically place the updated files processed from the
upstream git repositories.

As there is now a rootwrap filter file, the appropriate tasks

implemented. A little clean-up of syntax of tasks near those
modified have been included.

Finally - to resolve the ansible-lint issue the use of

Send just as many requests with X-Delete-At-* as we do X-Container-* to
the object server.  Furthermore, stop the object server on making an
update to the expirer queue when it wasn't told to do so and remove the
log warning which would have been produced.

Reason:

It can be the case that the number of object replicas (OR) is larger
than the number of container replicas (CR) for a given storage policy
(most likely in case of EC).  Before this commit, only CR object servers
received the x-delete-at-* headers, which means that OR - CR object
servers did not receive the headers.  The servers missing the header
would produce a log warning and create the x-delete-at-container header
and async update on their own, which could lead to a bug, if the
expiring_objects_container_divisor option was misconfigured.

Currently, the configuration delivered via
service_config_settings does not provide the
transformation path regarding the logs for
containerized deployments. So logs are not
correctly configured on fluentd on containerized
deployments.

This path added this feature so the logs are
properly located on fluentd configuration.

Added unit test for this issue

When the support of protocol numbers in security groups
was fixed in [1], it introduced two deficiencies in the
iptables code:

- it was missing some protocols, for example, 'icmp', 'tcp'
  and 'udp', so when rules were added by number we did not
  use their name as iptables expects
- it used a dictionary to map numbers to names, but protocol
  numbers are stored as strings (i.e. '1' != 1)

Updated the iptables number mapping dict to have all
currently-known values, even those that are already well-known
and should have been using a string instead of a number.

Also changed the iptables number mapping dict to use
strings as the keys instead of numbers, since that's
what will be passed from the security group code.

Removed IPTABLES_PROTOCOL_MAP as it lives in neutron-lib,
and accidentally snuck-in in [1].

oslosphinx is obsolete and maintained up to Pike release.
openstackdocstheme is its replacement, and octavia-dashboard has
already switched to it (doc/source/conf.py:html_theme).

If callers of get_devices_with_ip(), or

could match any ip_cidr in that range on the interface.
Callers need to pass the IP without the prefix portion in
order to match it exactly.  Added a helper utility to
strip the cidr part from a ip_cidr.

Determined the unit test for this can't actually check
this case since we are mocking the return value from
/sbin/ip, so modified it to just make sure the dict
is correct.

Added a functional test that adds two IP addresses in
the same IP range to verify that we actually filter
correctly when a 'to=IP' is specified.

This blueprint seeks to add a TripleO TCP Wrapper Service.

TCP Wrappers can provide an extra level of network security to TCP
wrapped services and is a check criteria for various security compliance
bodies such as DISA STIG and CIS.

This blueprint is centered on implementation of a puppet module and

Delegate code style validation to computers, they're better than human
at it :)

This commit adds a new `tools/validate-indentation.sh` script that
errors when it finds an indented Dockerfile instruction, and enables
the validation in the pep8 check.

Also adjust the logic of `tools/validate-all-dockerfiles.sh` so that it
doesn't stop on first errors but instead shows all of them.

Fixes the remaining indentations in Dockerfiles.

Previously OVB was configured using a monolithic environment file
that had to contain all of the parameters and resource_registry
entries needed for the stack.  Recently support was added for a more
TripleO-like system of sample environment files, which makes the
configuration of OVB much cleaner.  While the old method will be
supported for a period of time, we should go ahead and switch to the
new method because the old one is now deprecated.

The role files unfortunately do not support this sort of configuration
yet, but while working on this change I remembered that roles
inherit their configuration from the parent stack so we don't
actually need to duplicate the network-isolation resource_registry
entries in the role file.  This simplifies the configuration quite a
bit too.

The openstack doc standard location is 'user', so go with that.
Incorporate pages from the shade and occ docs into the appropriate
places in the user index file.

This still leaves user/logging and user/guide/logging which need to be
rationalized. That will come in the next commit, as it also needs to
actually rationalize the logging helper functions.

Remove the Makefile, as it's not used by things.
