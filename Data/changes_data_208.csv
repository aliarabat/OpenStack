This change adds a bit of introduction and and imports
the last version of the guide almost unchanged:
- minimal changes to few then-internal references, now external;
- a few formatting fixes (long lines, broken links, etc).

In Python 3.3+, 'sys.platform' no longer includes a major version [1]:

  issue 12326: On Linux, sys.platform doesn't contain the major version
  anymore. It is now always 'linux', instead of 'linux2' or 'linux3'
  depending on the Linux version used to build Python. Replace
  sys.platform == 'linux2' with sys.platform.startswith('linux'), or
  directly sys.platform == 'linux' if you don't need to support older
  Python versions.

Since we only care about Python 3.6 or greater, we could simply check
for 'linux'. However, the libvirt driver isn't supported on non-Linux
hosts so this was always a dumb check. Simply remove it instead.

The Kaminario driver used to accept the unique_fqdn_network
configuration option in the specific driver section, but when we moved
this option to be an option also used by 3PAR we introduced a regression
where the parameter was now only used if it was defined in the shared
configuration group.

This patch fixes this and makes it possible for the option to be defined
in the shared configuration group as well as the driver specific
section.

Rax hosts uses qemu software emulated VMs without leveraging the
magic with-in the processors to help ensure speedy execution.

As such, they can be substantially slower in some operations, such
decompressing ramdisks. This adds an unpredictable element into our
CI and causes job failures when they should ahve succeeded, which
causes more rechecks, which consumes more resources... and the cycle
continues.

So instead, we'll extend the timeout a little, to hopefully give the
job time to complete without causing failures.

This patch refactors the failover flows to improve the performance
and reliability of failovers in Octavia.

Specific improvements are:
* More tasks and flows will retry when other OpenStack services are
  failing.
* Failover can now succeed even when all of the amphora are missing
  for a given load balancer.
* It will check and repair the load balancer VIP should the VIP
  port(s) become corrupted in neutron.
* It will cleanup extra resources that may be associated with a
  load balancer in the event of a cloud service failure.

This patch also removes some dead code.

For the cases where we can change IP version type compares,
we change them with this change.

Note: other uses of netutils still exist, and we should
eventually see if we can phase them out, however the remaining
uses are around MAC address validations.

Add a new ``[ipmi]use_ipmitool_retries`` option. When set to
``True`` and timing is supported by ipmitool, the number of
retries and command interval will be passed to ipmitool so
that ipmitool will do the retries.  When set to ``False``,
ironic will do the retries.

The default is ``True``, so this will not change the current
behaviour which is to have ipmitool do the retries when
timing is supported.

Setting to ``False`` will help with certain BMCs which do
not support the Cipher Suites command.  In this case ipmitool
can take up to 10 seconds for each retry which results in a
total time exceeding ``[ipmi]command_retry_timeout``.

This patch intends to make the transition of the OVN DevStack module
easier by allowing both copies of it to exist at the same time, the one
in Neutron repository and the one in the DevStack repository [0].

1) Make create_public_bridge idempotent

If we call this function more than once the second call and on will fail
with the following error:

2020-07-13 09:12:53.885633 | controller | ++
/opt/stack/neutron/devstack/lib/ovn_agent:create_public_bridge:263 :
sudo ip addr add 172.24.5.1/24 dev br-ex
2020-07-13 09:12:53.894247 | controller | RTNETLINK answers: File exists

During the transiton of moving the OVN DevStack from the Neutron
repository to the DevStack repository [0] this method is being invoked
twice in the ovn job in the DevStack gate because it will be cause as
part of the plugin being enabled and the normal code execution.

This patch makes the method idempotent by calling ""addr replace"" instead
of ""addr add"" to avoid the ""RTNETLINK answers: File exists"" error.

2) Move the setup of the tcpdump on br-ex to ""extra"" to it can start
after the create_public_bridge is called.

Method _ensure_default_security_group wasn't atomic as it first tries to get
default SG and if that not exists in DB, it tries to create it.

It may happend, like e.g. in Calico plugin that between
get_default_sg_id method and create_security_group method, this default
SG will be created by other neutron worker. And in such case there will
be Duplicate entry exception raised.

So this patch is adding handling of such exception.

We temporarily disabled scenario tests in
the voting LVM job [1] because of a bug
in which a kernel problem caused a reboot
in the middle of the job when it ran in a
Xen virtualization environment on rax nodes.

The kernel has been updated on those nodes
and the problem has gone away, as evidenced
in various checks jobs in this review, so
let's reenable the scenario tests.

Bug #1886668 has now been addressed in ubuntu, and
the new kernel no longer suffers from the problem
that led to mid-test reboots like the previous ones
did. So we can safely re-enable scenario tests in the
gating LVM job.

For all the tasks in common/deploy-steps-playbooks-common.yaml:

* any_errors_fatal will be set to False for all tasks as this is
  shared with the scale tasks or where nodes may not be available.
  Due to https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70663 this cannot
  be set dynamically at this time. If an error occurs it'll get picked
  up by a future task.

* Add ignore_unreachable to all the tasks which didn't have it before
  (and set it to scale_ignore_unreachable | default(false))

This will allow a scale-down to work fine when a node that is being
scaled down is unreachable.

In the last PTG the Neutron team discussed and decided to undeprecate
the neutron-legacy module in DevStack because that's the module being
used (almost) everywhere and it works. The lib/neutron was an attempt
to refactor the old module but, in the last few years it hasn't gained
any traction and due to the lack of features and people to work on it,
it's going to be removed from DevStack eventually.

Below is a snippet from the PTG summary email [0] about this topic:

<snippet>
In Devstack there are currently 2 modules which can configure
Neutron. Old one called ""lib/neutron-legacy"" and the new one called
""lib/neutron"". It is like that since many cycles that ""lib/neutron-legacy""
is deprecated. But it is still used everywhwere. New module isn't still
finished and isn't working fine.  This is very confusing for users as
really maintained and recommended is still ""lib/neutron-legacy"" module.

During the discussion Sean Collins explained us that originally this
new module was created as an attempt to refactor old module, and to
make Neutron in the Devstack better to maintain. But now we see that
this process failed as new module isn't still used and we don't have
any cycles to work on it. So our final conclusion is to ""undeprecate""
old ""lib/neutron-legacy"" and get rid of the new module.
</snippet>

This patch changes the Ironic jobs to use the old Neutron module in
DevStack.

Glance has a facility lazy loading for legacy images which will be called
on get/list api calls to add store information in image's location metadata
based on location URL of image. Even if admin decides to change the store
names in glance-api.conf same will also be updated in location metadata
for all images related to that particular store. Current implementation of
legacy image performs this operation on each get/list call as location metadata
is not getting updated in database or it doesn't handle to perform store name
check in glance-api.conf.

Improvements done:
1. Save updated location metadata information in database permenantly
2. Add logic to perform lazy loading only if store information is not present
in location metadata or store present in location metadata is not defined in
glance's enbaled_backends configuration option.

Update/Upgrade commands have now a prompt by default that ask for

command that may cause the problems to infrastructure.
This prompt can be skipped with --yes/-y argument.

Note: putting ""UPDATE"" and ""UPGRADE"" in uppercase to make sure this is
visible and clear. We have seen many users running the wrong command and
ending up doing an upgrade instead of an update.

Note2: this prompt will be ported to the upgrade and FFWD workflows to
prevent unexpected execution to prevent potential harm to

NOTE(elod.illes): This is a combination of 2 commits: the cherry-pick
hash checker script and a fix for the script.

1. Check cherry-pick hashes in pep8 tox target

This adds a tools/ script that checks any cherry-picked hashes
on the current commit (or a provided commit) to make sure that
all the hashes exist on at least master or stable/.* branches.
This should help avoid accidentally merging stable backports
where one of the hashes along the line has changed due to conflicts.

2. Fix cherry-pick check for merge patch

Cherry-pick check script validates the proposed patch's commit message.
If a patch is not on top of the given branch then Zuul rebases it to
the top and the patch becomes a merge patch. In this case the script
validates the merge patch's commit message instead of the original
patch's commit message and fails.

This fix selects the parent of the patch if it is a merge patch.

The tripleo_free strategy should allow the tasks to run freely for a
given playbook that defines using the tripleo_free strategy. The defaul
strategy is a linear one that will execute each task across all servers
prior to moving to the next task. The tripleo_free strategy will execute
the tasks on servers without syncryonizing the tasks within a given
playbook. Because TripleO uses step concepts in our deployment, we
already have the syncronization points in the main playbook. The outer
playbook should be done linearly but the deployment steps themselves
should be done freely.

The tripleo_free playbook won't stop execution on all hosts if one host
fails or becomes unreachable. It will however end the play exeuction if
any error occurs on any host. This is similar to the deployment failures
we used to have with Heat where a failure on any single node would stop
the deployment at a given deployment step.  A future improvement of this
will be to add logic to handle a failure percentage on a given TripleO
role to only stop the playbook if the failure percentage exceeds a
defined amount. Currently any failure will stop a playbook but may not
stop later tasks from executing on the rest of the hosts. We will likely
need to implement a tripleo_linear strategy based on the upstream linear
strategy to understand these failure percentages as well.

NOTE: During the testing of this, we identified two issues with the free
strategy in ansible itself. We will need those fixes landed in the
version of ansible prior to being able to land this.

For all the tasks in common/deploy-steps-playbooks-common.yaml:

* any_errors_fatal will be set to False for all tasks as this is
  shared with the scale tasks or where nodes may not be available.
  Due to https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70663 this cannot
  be set dynamically at this time. If an error occurs it'll get picked
  up by a future task.

* Add ignore_unreachable to all the tasks which didn't have it before
  (and set it to scale_ignore_unreachable | default(false))

This will allow a scale-down to work fine when a node that is being
scaled down is unreachable.

Update the image upload command for kernels/ramdisks so partition
image based CI integration testing jobs, like those used by ironic,
are not failing due to only the partition image being uploaded without
a kernel and ramdisk, which causes code interpreting the image to
believe that the image is infact a whole-disk-image.

This is needed as a result of change:
https://review.opendev.org/#/c/735966

+ functions:upload_image:427 : '[' -n /opt/stack/devstack/files/images/cirros-0.5.1-x86_64-uec/cirros-0.5.1-x86_64-initrd ']'
++ functions:upload_image:428 : oscwrap --os-cloud=devstack-admin --os-region-name=RegionOne image create cirros-0.5.1-x86_64-uec-ramdisk hw_rng_model=virtio --public --container-format ari --disk-format ari

Where previously ""--property"" was prepended to the properties set,
however for partition images, it doesn't make sense to support
explicit property setting as the kernel and ramdisk id values are
linked to by the primary glance image object once uploaded.

The majority of ironic's CI is built upon devstack, and thus some changes
which may pass setting up a stock devstack, may still ultimately cripple
Ironic's CI. Mainly in terms of integration with other projects.

As such, it seems logical to make the CI job voting such that breaking
changes have visibility upfront.

Also re-names the job name to the more modern name as the
driver name the job mentions was explicitly removed some time
ago in favor of what is called driver composition.

This change came out of a discussion of Neutron changing the default to
OVN. Which while problematic for Ironic due to a lack of necessary DHCP
server capabilities, the topic of the neturon-legacy/neutron plugin came
up and Ironic, and at the time of this change Ironic uses the ""neutron""
plugin. As such, abrupt removal of the plugin would be a fairly
catastropic change for Ironic, hence the need for cross-gating.

Follow the same pattern of the other jobs which deploy devstack
but runs also functional tests (see devtack-tox-functional
and devstack-tox-functional-consumer).

Without this, the older branches where cinderlib functional tests
use Python 2 (stein, and soon train when that is branched) fails
because they try to install packages part of which are Python 3
only.

The same change was applied to the branchless jobs defined
inside cinder-tempest-plugins: https://review.opendev.org/738078/

We added an integration gate job a couple of

tests that check whether manila-ui is working.

Previously (when python 2 was supported) we introduced some specific
exception management to detect connections issues when a rabbitmq
cluster node disappearing.

The original issue was that a ConnectionRefusedError is thrown and not
managed by oslo.messaging to detect heartbeat issue and call ensure_connection
for switching the connection destination (cluster node).

`ConnectionRefusedError` is only a python 3 exception [2].

Now that we only support python 3 we don't need to continue to
wrap/emulate this kind of exceptions (ConnectionRefusedError) [2] and
so we can drop the python 2 compatibility code to only support python 3 code.

This is actually two functions, one of which takes an XML string and
another than takes an existing domain. Neither return a domain but
rather a Guest object, and while the first actually creates a new domain
along with the new Guest, the latter simply creates the new Guest and
resumes the existing domain. Simplify the function by ensuring it only
focuses on the former case, creation of new domains as part of the new
Guest object. The revised function is renamed, along with a related
function, '_create_domain_and_network', to reflect what it actually
returns. The other cases are replaced by simple call to
'Guest.resume()', which is all the latter case was really doing.

While we're here, we also update the function signature of the later to
make the 'block_device_info' argument mandatory, since all callers were
passing this anyway. All of this has some test impact but nothing
serious.

We also move some of the tests from 'test_driver' to 'test_guest', since
they were actually testing things from 'virt.libvirt.guest' but clearly
just weren't moved when that module was introduced many cycles ago.

Finally, we rename the '_prepare_domain_for_snapshot' and
'_snapshot_domain' functions to reflect what they're actually doing,
namely suspending and then resuming the domain before and after a
(cold) snapshot, respectively.

The common role was previously added as a dependency to all other roles.
It would set a fact after running on a host to avoid running twice. This
had the nice effect that deploying any service would automatically pull
in the common services for that host. When using tags, any services with
matching tags would also run the common role. This could be both
surprising and sometimes useful.

When using Ansible at large scale, there is a penalty associated with
executing a task against a large number of hosts, even if it is skipped.
The common role introduces some overhead, just in determining that it
has already run.

This change extracts the common role into a separate play, and removes
the dependency on it from all other roles. New groups have been added
for cron, fluentd, and kolla-toolbox, similar to other services. This
changes the behaviour in the following ways:

* The common role is now run for all hosts at the beginning, rather than
  prior to their first enabled service
* Hosts must be in the necessary group for each of the common services
  in order to have that service deployed. This is mostly to avoid
  deploying on localhost or the deployment host
* If tags are specified for another service e.g. nova, the common role
  will *not* automatically run for matching hosts. The common tag must
  be specified explicitly

The last of these is probably the largest behaviour change. While it
would be possible to determine which hosts should automatically run the
common role, it would be quite complex, and would introduce some
overhead that would probably negate the benefit of splitting out the
common role.

When calculating the device tagging metadata for PFs, we need to get
the PCI device's MAC address in order to find its associated VIF.
Previously, this was done by calling
pci_utils.get_mac_by_pci_address() and passing pf_interface=True. This
was incorrect. It caused _get_sysfs_netdev_path() to return a
nonexistent sysfs path to get_ifname_by_pci_address(). The latter's
os.listdir() call then raised an Exception. This was caught and
bubbled up as a PciDeviceNotFoundById exception. This caused
_build_hostdev_metadata() in the libvirt driver to skip that
interface's metadata.

pf_interface=True is used when passing a VF's PCI address in order to
request the PCI address of its parent PF. As this is not what
_build_hostdev_metadata() needs, this patch stops doing that.

In the case of PFs using VFIO-PCI (as opposed to a regular networking
kernel driver), PciDeviceNotFoundById is expected to be raised, as
those devices have no associated netdev. Instead of the previous
debug-level generic notice, this patch promotes the log message to a
warning explaining that device tagging does not work with VFIO-PCI
devices.

This patch (in charms.ceph [1], copied here) add the concept of a
watchdog to the upgrade_monitor so that the charm can achieve two
objectives of 1. Waiting for much longer, but 2. detecting whether the
previous node has died / gone away.  This is needed for 'large' OSDs
where the time to upgrade a node may exceed the current limit of 10
minutes, but also not to wait for 30 minutes on a dead previous node.
The watchdog implements two timeouts and an addition 'alive' key from
the previous node to indicate that it is still running.  Otherwise,
functionality is identical.

The Ceph cluster needs not to mark down OSDs during the time when
the nodes are undercloud LEAPP upgrade because during that step
nodes will be rebooted.

This change implements setting and unsetting of the Ceph flags
(noout, norebalance, norecover and nobackfill) required to avoid
marking the OSDs down: the involved tasks are executed before node
(each) starts the LEAPP process and after the upgrade is finished and
the node rebooted.

This patch is going directly into train because it's trying to address
a problem that depends on the queens/train FFWD upgrade, while in
the main branch the upgrade_tasks list is still empty.

This patch add the concept of a watchdog to the upgrade_monitor so that
the charm can achieve two objectives of 1. Waiting for much longer, but
2. detecting whether the previous node has died / gone away.  This is
needed for 'large' OSDs where the time to upgrade a node may exceed the
current limit of 10 minutes, but also not to wait for 30 minutes on a
dead previous node.  The watchdog implements two timeouts and an
addition 'alive' key from the previous node to indicate that it is still
running.  Otherwise, functionality is identical.

In order to facilitate writing and running tempest tests for these features
in all environments covered by the various jobs across all the projects that
include Glance, we should default to this deployment method.

It is still possible to deploy glance in uwsgi mode by setting the flag to

work. However, the default should be what we expect deployers will use,

When evacuating an instance between compute hosts on shared storage,
during the rebuild operation we call spawn() on the destination
compute. spawn() currently assumes that it should cleanup all
resources on failure, which results in user data being deleted in the
evacuate case.

This change modifies spawn in the libvirt driver such that it only
cleans up resources it created.

Block traffic between br-int and br-physical is over kill
and will at least

1. interrupt vlan flow during startup, and is particularly
so if dvr enabled
2. if let's rabbitmq is not stable, it is possible data plane
will be affected and vlan will never work.

Using openstack on k8s particularly amplifies the problem
because pod could be killed pretty easily by liveness
probes.

When no tag is set for an entry in ContainerImagePrepare, the default
tag from container-images/container_image_prepare_defaults.yaml will be
assumed, which is typically current-tripleo, or a release version such
as 16.0.

In most cases, this tag will exist. However, when using a satellite with
a content view that has been filtered on tags, it likely won't exist
since content views are often used with container image versions that
are not the latest.

In the case where no tag is set in the entry in ContainerImagePrepare,
and the default tag does not exist in the container repo, the latest tag
from the repo will be assumed instead.

In the last PTG the Neutron team discussed and decided to undeprecate
the neutron-legacy module in DevStack because that's the module being
used (almost) everywhere and it works. The lib/neutron was an attempt
to refactor the old module but, in the last few years it hasn't gained
any traction and due to the lack of features and people to work on it,
it's going to be removed from DevStack eventually.

Below is a snippet from the PTG summary email [0] about this topic:

<snippet>
In Devstack there are currently 2 modules which can configure
Neutron. Old one called ""lib/neutron-legacy"" and the new one called
""lib/neutron"". It is like that since many cycles that
""lib/neutron-legacy""
is deprecated. But it is still used everywhwere. New module isn't still
finished and isn't working fine.  This is very confusing for users as
really maintained and recommended is still ""lib/neutron-legacy"" module.

During the discussion Sean Collins explained us that originally this
new module was created as an attempt to refactor old module, and to
make Neutron in the Devstack better to maintain. But now we see that
this process failed as new module isn't still used and we don't have
any cycles to work on it. So our final conclusion is to ""undeprecate""
old ""lib/neutron-legacy"" and get rid of the new module.
</snippet>

This patch changes the Metalsmith jobs to use the old Neutron module in
DevStack.

This change is a proof-of-concept for enabling floating IP's on routed
networks. To be able to create a subnet that spans all segments of a
routed network, a special subnet service type of 'network:routed' is
used to denote a network that can span all segments of a routed network.
To create floating IP's on a routed network, the subnet must be created
with a service_type of 'network:routed'. After the subnet has been
created, floating IP's can be allocated and associated as before.
See the design spec https://review.opendev.org/#/c/486450/ for
reference.

One caveat for this approach is that it requires the underlying
infrastructure to be aware of and able to route /32 host routes
for the floating IP. This implies that in practice, use of the
'network:routed' service type should be done in conjunction with
one or both of the following:

1. Third-party SDN backend that handles this service type in its
   own way
2. neutron-dynamic-routing and the BGP service plugin for announcing
   the appropriate next-hops for floating IP's. This is compatible
   with DVR and non-DVR environments.

finished and isn't working fine.  This is very confusing for users as
really maintained and recommended is still ""lib/neutron-legacy"" module.

During the discussion Sean Collins explained us that originally this
new module was created as an attempt to refactor old module, and to
make Neutron in the Devstack better to maintain. But now we see that
this process failed as new module isn't still used and we don't have
any cycles to work on it. So our final conclusion is to ""undeprecate""
old ""lib/neutron-legacy"" and get rid of the new module.
</snippet>

This patch changes the ironic-prometheus-exporter jobs to use the old
Neutron module in DevStack.

Block traffic between br-int and br-physical is over kill
and will at least

1. interrupt vlan flow during startup, and is particularly
so if dvr enabled
2. if let's rabbitmq is not stable, it is possible data plane
will be affected and vlan will never work.

Using openstack on k8s particularly amplifies the problem
because pod could be killed pretty easily by liveness
probes.

A bit like we did for I3e0e86026f5a4a78473bed824cd1682d3a020cd5 we
should remove the nss-systemd lookup from containers. The reasons for
this are as follows:
1) Just like for I3e0e86026f5a4a78473bed824cd1682d3a020cd5
when this nss module is triggered it tries to talk to dbus.
It triggers a bunch of selinux denials and it makes little sense
to open all containers to talk to dbus.
In particular, if a container is run as non-privileged and bind-mounts
/run from the host, we will hit selinux denials like the following:

  type=USER_AVC msg=audit(1592337775.860:74119): pid=1284 uid=81 auid=4294967295 ses=4294967295 subj=system_u:system_r:system_dbusd_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 msg='avc:  denied  { send_msg } for msgtype=method_call interface=org.freedesktop.DBus member=Hello dest=org.freedesktop.DBus spid=406228 scontext=system_u:system_r:container_t:s0:c162,c886 tcontext=system_u:system_r:system_dbusd_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 tclass=dbus permissive=0  exe=""/usr/bin/dbus-daemon"" sauid=81 hostname=? addr=? terminal=?'UID=""dbus"" AUID=""unset"" SAUID=""dbus""

2) It just makes little sense in a kolla-world to have containers
talk to dbus/systemd and it saves us some time when a lookup triggers
the systemd module for whatever reason. Especially because the
nss-systemd module does a few things which are not useful in a container
(ensures that the root and nobody users and groups remain resolvable,
SystemD's DynamicUser= feature, provide Lookup API via Varlink)

The sed regex gives us the wanted results:

The ""old"" parameter passed to the handle_ha_chassis_group_changes()
method is a delta object and sometimes it does not contain the
""external_ids"" column (because it hasn't changed).

The absence of that column was misleading that method into believe that
the ""old"" object was no longer a gateway chassis and that triggered some
changes in the HA group. Changing the HA group resulted in the SRIOV
(external in OVN) ports to start flapping between the gateway chassis.

This patch is adding a check to verify that the ""external_ids"" column
has changed before acting on it, otherwise just ignore the update and
return.

From now, limit_hosts will take precedence over the blacklisted_hostnames.
And therefore Ansible won't be run with two --limit if both limit hosts
and blacklisted hostnames are in use. When we want to run Ansible on
specific hosts, we will ignore the blacklisted nodes and assume we know
what we do. In the case of the scale-down scenario, the unreachable nodes
are ignored.

Sharing the admin password with peers over the 'cluster' relation
was needed in case the leader would die and the next leader would
then need that information. This was implemented years ago when
the leader DB didn't exist.

This led to a race condition described in the mentioned bug and
can now be safely removed.

Validated by deploying several keystone and glance units, then
removing the keystone leader, then adding a glance unit and
checking that this new unit gets its service credentials.

Also added useful traces, made linter happy and increased fernet
token expiration to avoid spurious test failures.

This patch reverts [0].

The code wasn't accounting for VLAN provider networks, as stated in the
bug #1842988, DVR won't work if the provider network (where the FIP is
created) is VLAN.

There was also an incosistency in how the external_mac was set for the
VLAN networks. Upon creating the FIP the code was checking for the
network type and not setting the external_mac attribute in case the
network was VLAN type. But, if the port went down and up again (e.g if
you reboot the VM) the event handler that set/unset the external_mac [1]
wasn't check for the type. This is how people worked around the DVR
problem (as stated in bug #1842988).

For more information see bug #1842988.

Currently, if you run the availability zone API tests when not using

Since creating availability zones requires reconfiguration of the nova

This patch adds tempest configuration settings for the required

This patch reverts [0].

The code wasn't accounting for VLAN provider networks, as stated in the
bug #1842988, DVR won't work if the provider network (where the FIP is
created) is VLAN.

There was also an incosistency in how the external_mac was set for the
VLAN networks. Upon creating the FIP the code was checking for the
network type and not setting the external_mac attribute in case the
network was VLAN type. But, if the port went down and up again (e.g if
you reboot the VM) the event handler that set/unset the external_mac [1]
wasn't check for the type. This is how people worked around the DVR
problem (as stated in bug #1842988).

For more information see bug #1842988.

Make sure stestr is executed using the python interpreter set inside
the virtualenv, otherwise the libraries installed there may not
found. This is due to the fact that (stestr default shebang points
to system python when installed through devstack and the functional
tox target uses that version thanks to sitepackages=True.
The sitepackages option  must be used to find a few system ceph/python
libraries not available on pypi.

Setting PATH is not really needed nowadays, so remove the custom
workaround. It is worth noting that the hack would not be needed anymore
and PATH could be set through setenv (extending {env:PATH}).

As cinderlib changes can break cinder and cinder-tempest-plugin,
and they indeed did it in the past, so ensure that everything works
by running cinder-tempest-plugin-lvm-lio-barbican.

Add a new ``[ipmi]use_ipmitool_retries`` option. When set to
``True`` and timing is supported by ipmitool, the number of
retries and command interval will be passed to ipmitool so
that ipmitool will do the retries.  When set to ``False``,
ironic will do the retries.

The default is ``True``, so this will not change the current
behaviour which is to have ipmitool do the retries when
timing is supported.

Setting to ``False`` will help with certain BMCs which do
not support the Cipher Suites command.  In this case ipmitool
can take up to 10 seconds for each retry which results in a
total time exceeding ``[ipmi]command_retry_timeout``.

Policy checks are skipped when looking up a share-type
by name.  This causes share creation attempts that specify
a valid share-type to pass the early API check on share type
even if the share type named is private and not shared with
the user's project.  The share creation fails later, but after
the database record for the share is created.  Although the
operation fails with an ERROR, the share is stuck in CREATING
state.

Fix this issue by checking the user's project in the database
API just as we do for share type lookups by uuid.

Under certain deployment conditions, the charm can attempt to write to
the /etc/nagios/nrpe.d/ directory before it exists.  This directory is
created by the nrpe charm, but if the hacluster (this charm) gets
installed first, then it can be triggered to attempt to set up the nrpe
entries before the directory can be created by nrpe.  This change (and
the associated charm-helpers change) ensures that the charm will delay
the nrpe config until the directory is available (and thus, the nrpe
charm is fully installed)

A previous commit did a huge cleanup in order to converge the file
context to container_file_t - a second pass is needed since some merges
happened after, pointing to the old name.

This patch also replaces the ""chcon"" call with a ""restorecon"", since the
openstack-selinux provides the correct fcontext for
/var/lib/config-data.

We might want to consider either removing completely, or moving this
restorecon to a FFU task though, in order to avoid losing time during

This patch introcues a new class, neutron::server::notifications::nova,

Note that the default values for notify_nova_on_port_status_changes and
notify_nova_on_data_status_changes are set to $::os_service_default in
this change, to use the default values defined in neutron (True)
instead of overriding it in puppet-neutron.

In an instance mixed with different type of CPUs, the shared CPU

This patch reverts [0].

The code wasn't accounting for VLAN provider networks, as stated in the
bug #1842988, DVR won't work if the provider network (where the FIP is
created) is VLAN.

There was also an incosistency in how the external_mac was set for the
VLAN networks. Upon creating the FIP the code was checking for the
network type and not setting the external_mac attribute in case the
network was VLAN type. But, if the port went down and up again (e.g if
you reboot the VM) the event handler that set/unset the external_mac [1]
wasn't check for the type. This is how people worked around the DVR
problem (as stated in bug #1842988).

For more information see bug #1842988.

Prior to this patch, if the [ovn]/enable_distributed_floating_ip
configuration option changed in an existing environment the OVN
driver wouldn't adapt to it requiring administrators to clear up the
""external_mac"" column from the NAT table manually for the existing
floating ips.

With this patch, OVN will automatically correct existing NAT entries for
floating ips whenever this option changes.

To make the code simpler when handling the port up/down event this patch
always set the logical_port and the neutron:fip_external_mac key in the
external_ids column of the NAT entry when creating the floating ip.

Note that we are not using the maintenance task for this either, we are
re-using the event that set/unset the ""external_mac"" column for this
because, whenenver the service is restarted (after the configuration is
changed, we need to restart for it to take effect) the IDL will re-trigger
those events.

* While fetching a list of object in the REST layer we now check
  if the object has already been deleted in parallel (by catching
  the corresponding exception caused by lazy loading) and don't
  include it into the result set.
* Added the corresponding test that uses mocking and two synchronized
  threads to reproduce this corner case.
* Minor style changes.

This patch is adding support for the router_availability_zone extension
for Neutron.

The OVN driver will now read from the router's availability_zone_hints
field and schedule the router ports onto OVN chassis belonging to those
AZs.

Since the OVN driver does not rely on the L3 agent, this patch does not
re-use the configuration option for the agent to configure the
availability zone that a Chassis belongs to (even because there's no
configuration file in nodes such as networker nodes). Instead, this
patch reuses the ""ovn-cms-options"" field from the local OVSDB to
configure the Chassis. The follow syntax has been used:

$ ovs-vsctl set Open_VSwitch .
external-ids:ovn-cms-options=""enable-chassis-as-gw,availability-zones=az0:az1""

In the example above, the Chassis has been configured to belong to two
AZs: ""az0"" and ""az1"".

This patch also implements listing the availability zones:
$ openstack availability zone list

As well as validating the router's availability zone hints:
$ openstack router create --availability-zone-hint az0
--availability-zone-hint az1 test_router

The above command would fail if there's no ""az0"" and ""az1"" configured in
any OVN chassis.

Documentation for this feature is being written and will be submitted
in a separated patch.

In case when related dvr router is configured by L3 agent, it is first
added to the tasks queue and then processed as any other router hosted

But if L3 agent will ask neutron server about details of such router,
it wasn't returned back as this router wasn't really scheduled to the
compute node which was asking for it. It was ""only"" related to some
other router scheduled to this compute node. Because of that router's
info wasn't found in reply from the neutron-server and L3 agent was
removing it from the compute node.

Now _get_router_ids_for_agent method from the l3_dvrscheduler_db module

In a future change, we'll want access to this so that it's possible to
retrieve vTPM data during the unrescue operation. While we're here, it
seems nothing is using the 'network_info' argument anymore, presumably
since the demise of nova-network, and this can and should be dropped.
Resolve both issues in one go, adding the 'context' parameter, dropping
the 'network_info' one, and updating the various callers and tests for
same.

There could be a scenarip where Ingress Controller, Docker,
and Kubernetes are not fully functional on a Control node,
but the Calico pod still functions.
In this case, liveness probes will not help take down the Ingress
Controller pod so the VIP is still associated with the node. This
results in Calico continuing to announce the sick Control node as
a BGP endpoint for the VIP. All requests will still be sent to the
sick node which would result in failures.
This cron-job monitors the Ingress Controller node and if node is
not completely ready, it will remove the VIP which will triggering
Calico to remove the node as a BGP endpoint for the VIP.

The default io thread pool size is calculated based on system CPU number.
It might not suitable on some systems which have CPUs reserved for specific
usage.

This PS adds the ability to change the io thread pool size.

This PS proposes to restore suuport for deploying mons as
statefulsets in addtion to daemonsets[1]. The rationale here is thus:
We can gain some limited portability of mons in 4 rack deployments
were we want to try and maintain three mons at all times, including
when rack outages occur. This does come with some risk though, in
that node labels will need to be carefully managed to limit the
range of movement possible, as if all mons were to migrate to
'fresh' nodes - we would loose the entire cluster.

When creating / deleting volumes, many file descriptors are created
and destroyed in the cinder-volume container. However, when
deleting a very large number (several hundreds) of volumes, it
takes a long time for the FD to disappear, and when the number is
increased and exceeds the limit, the cinder-volume is in a running
state but stops without performing any other operation. The solution
is to restart the cinder-volume. This patch add liveness/readiness for
cinder services to restart if something goes wrong.

- check state of cinder service through rpc communication
- if service is down, pod will be restart
