This commit moves the devstack-external-plugins spec into the
implemented dir. This bp was closed some time ago but the spec
approval fell through the cracks and was only merged recently.
Additionally the recent patch to do a mass cleanup of all the
specs missed this move to implemented. So let's take care of
it now.

As part of this the devstack specs line in the index is commented
out because this was the last open devstack spec. Without any open
specs in the devstack dir sphinx will warn on there being no files,
which we treat as a fatal error in ci.

In order to make snapshotting ephemeral disks stored in rbd efficient
and avoid any local disk use, nova will tell glance about an rbd
snapshot's location rather than uploading data.

Since rbd images with snapshots cannot be deleted, nova cannot remove
the original disk in this case. Instead, nova renames the original rbd
image so glance can determine that it is no longer used by
nova. Glance can then delete this rbd image once its snapshots are
deleted.

To effect this, modify the rbd store's backend to recursively delete
any parents that have a special string in their name. This has no
chance of name collision from other openstack use since rbd images are
otherwise only named with uuids.

If an image based on a vm is deleted while the vm is still running,
only delete the parent snapshot, not the whole vm image. Rename
_delete_image() to _cleanup_image(), and add _cleanup_parent() to
determine when deleting the parent is safe.

To allow glance to handle this, it needs write access to the ceph pool
used by nova ephemeral disks.

There are cases where it takes a long time to create a new resource as
requested by the scaling operation on an ASG resource, for instance, a
nova server creation followed by a complex SoftwareDeployment. During
this process, additional alarms may come in but failed to be blocked
by the current cooldown checking mechanism because the very first
timestamp has yet to be generated. This is leading to unexpected size
adjustment to the ASG.

This patch augments the existing cooldown checking mechanism with a
scaling-in-progress test so that additional alarms arriving during
the very first scaling operation will be ignored.

Resize operation in nova(that we are for flavor update) is
asynchronous. So the server may be ACTIVE when we are checking
server-resize operations(not RESIZE as was excepted).
We need to wait for a while till the server becomes RESIZE.

The patch add support of this case to Server resource in heat.

The count is performed in 2 parts
- A function which builds a list of all nested stacks
  by recursively calling stack_get_all_by_owner_id
- A query which counts resources which belong to the list
  of stacks

Considering this will be the basis for fixing bug #1455589 then this
approach is appropriate for backporting to stable/kilo, but master would
ideally replace this soon with a new Stack attribute that stores the
calculated resource count.

Problem description:
If a docker swarm baymodel, docker swarm bay, and docker container are
created according to instructions listed in the Magnum quick-start guide
(magnum/doc/source/dev/dev-quickstart.rst), then the container-create
operation fails with the following error:

   ERROR: Docker internal Error: decoding Unicode is not supported (HTTP 500)

The root cause is that the container image name is being passed as a
unicode value (e.g. u'cirros') to the docker conductor handler's
container_create() method, and this in turn is passed to _encode_utf8().
In _encode_utf8(), it's assumed that a string is being passed in, so a
conversion to unicode is attempted by passing the (unicode) image name
to six.u(). However, six.u() does not support unicode conversion of
unicode objects.

Fix description:
Make the _encode_utf8() method more resilient by allowing both string and
unicode arguments. Only do the intermediate conversion to unicode for
string arguments.

This change removes the ""guest"" user. This patch fixes an issues
where the guest user was not being cared by default which could
leave a deployment vulnerable to should someone gain access to the
internal network that the messaging system runs within. To fix this
issue the guest user is simply being removed as its not needed by the
rest of the stack. The rpc-maas setup was updated to now support the
creation of the new monitoring user, which is being created as an

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

So this commit also does the following to avoid running microversion tests

- Override scenario in keypair v2.2 tests for microversion only not for v2 and v2.1
- Add logic in api_sample_base.py to run those tests on v2.1 code base.

Previously there were 4 python scripts being installed
into /usr/{local/}bin/ which contained the extension *.py.
There was also a developers script called barbican.sh
to create a developer's environment.

This change switches away from installing them as scripts,
preferring to use pbr's console_scripts entry point.  This
means that the scripts were moved to be part of a 'cmd'
module within the barbican module.

The barbican.sh script is also no longer installed as it
seems inappropriate to install this on consumers machines.

A few cosmetic changes were added to achieve pep8.

advantage of Zuul's Depends-On feature so that we can test changes
across multiple related modules. This is based on idea 1 from this

Removes the purging of the modules directory since r10k does that for
us.

This will probably be abstracted out into a separate function or
eventually a separate gem so that it can be more easily shared across

The need to redefine the typenames of versioned object is a common
usecase, which may be required either to make object name differ from
the python's classname or to give a same name to two different types to
indicates their duck-type compatibility.

The existing way of doing this is to override obj_name() classmethod of
VersionedObject class to return a needed string constant instead of
cls.__name__. However, such an override has a bad sideeffect: all the
descendants of such a class will have the same string constant as their
names as well, while this is most probably not needed.

This patch adds an alternative way to define the type name of the
versioned object: adding a 'NAME' attribute to appropriate class.
This attribute is used to compute the obj_name value, but only if the
attribute is defined at this particular class (i.e. is not inherited
from base).

The old way of overriding the obj_name() is still available for
backwards compatibility purposes but is not recommended for usage unless
it is required to have all the descendants to have the same obj_name
with their parent.

- Added some parameters to syntax check script in order to allow
  users to run tests against specific/all modules.
- Fixed $GEM_HOME var, it should not be set script-wide, since it
  breaks test executed via puppet-lint utility. We should set
  $GEM_HOME only for 'bundle' commands.
- Added possibility to disable 'rake lint' checks for modules with
  broken tests. Such modules will be tested with 'puppet-lint'
  utility.
- Updated .puppet-lint.rc for Apache module to support older
  versions of puppet-lint.

DocImpact: From now it's possible to run syntax check script for
some specific modules using '--module PATH_TO_MODULE' option, or
test all the modules at once using '--all'.
If you want to disable 'rake lint' test for some module, please
add such module name to './utils/jenkins/modules.disable_rake-lint'

The template had the assumption that each guideline would get its own
file. The downside of this is that it would make our table of contents
hard to navigate. I propose that each file should be a collection of
related guidelines and each guideline should be a subheader within the
file.

It's still easy to link to specific guidelines with anchor links to
subheaders.

We had different issues here.

First, sort command used to sort variables and services names is
dependent on the local, so fix it to C to have consistent
results. C local is available on all systems.

Second, awk doesn't recognize \s escape char for space on OSX. This
resulted in indented check_required_vars calls being ignored. In fact,
all variables checked via indented check_required_vars calls (i.e. in
a fuction or conditional block) are actually *optional* variables, so
I changed the behavior to ignore those.

The ""serial console"" feature was introduced as a means for connecting
to an instance without having network access. From a user perspective
it goes a similar direction like VNC, SPICE and RDP connections.
As an implementation decision, a user could EITHER use the log file
OR the serial console. The intention of this blueprint is to enable
libvirt guests to have

* a log file
* AND a serial console

in parallel.

If an instance is booted from a volume, shelved, and goes into an error

in-use state even the instance is deleted because instance has no host

Called _local_delete() to detach volume and destroy bdm if instance is
in shelved_offloaded state or has no host associated with it. This will
cleanup both volumes and the networks.

Currently in test_servers.py, ""test_delete_server_instance"" executes
similar to ""test_delete_server_instance_while_building"". This is because
""test_delete_server_instance"" calls instance.save() method which updates

When starting/restarting/rebuilding instances, it may happen that a
volume detach request comes right in the middle of attaching a volume
in the driver. In this case the hypervisor (e.g. libvirt) will throw
DiskNotFound exception in driver.detach_volume() call, but still
the volume gets attached eventually, when the instance starts.

This leaves the instance in the state, when the volume is `de-facto`
attached to it (i.e. shown in the `virsh dumpxmp $instance` output
for libvirt), but both Nova and Cinder think the volume is actually
*not* in-use.

The proposed solution is to give the hypervisor a chance to detach
the volume again when handling DiskNotFound exception as it must be

Splitting the requirements files into base, test, and optional

care about.  In other words, someone running with qpid does not
need kombu installed, and someone running rabbit does not need qpid
installed.

Note that this depends on a change to pbr to handle nested

demonstrate how this might be done.

When an exception is being deprecated from a library, it is usually
not called anywhere in the user code -- instead it is only caught, so
we never get a chance to see the deprecation message. This patch uses
the fact that an except statement has to do a subclass check on the
exceptions it is trying to catch, and puts the logging code in the
subclass check hook. Unfortunately, that hook has to be defined on the
metaclass, which makes the code a little hard to understand.

constraints files, unlike global_requirements, need to be able to
contain urls (specifically file:/// paths) so that we can constrain
libraries to be run from their git trees, rather than having them flap
all over the place as different servers specify different bounds. The
first edit-constraints implementation failed to parse such lines,
throwing errors instead.

This patch makes the support for urls optional, preventing changing
the semantics of requirements update.py logic.

For resource-list --nested-depth an extra column parent_resource
is added to the result. This has the following issues:
- parent_resource values cannot be used as the stack argument to
  resource-show
- templates with more than one ResourceGroup will have more than one
  parent_resource called ""0"", so there is no way of inferring the actual
  parent, and it is not possible to guess the correct parent resource
- parent_resource is inconsistent with event-list --nested-depth, which
  adds a stack_name column that doesn't have the above disadvantages.

column for resource-list --nested-depth.

This patch implements update_migrated_volume for LVM and Storwize
driver. It makes sure that after a successful volume migration,
the cinder volume name(id) is the same as the backend volume name(id).
Other back-end drivers can take this patch as a reference
to implement update_migrated_volume.

PS: Not applicable to attached or multi-attached volumes, since we need
to wait until the multi-attach lands in Nova.

extract-docs.py has several nice features over extract-docs.awk. The
obvious advantage is that it's easier for python developers to read than
the awk script (not that the awk script was particularly hard)

More importantly, this script has the property that it preserves line
numbers - so when you get a failure on line 206 of devtest.rst, that
means the error is on line 206 of devtest.sh, rather than being on some
random other line number.

I'd like to see this script integrated into Sphinx as a dedicated
pre-processor, but in the meantime this should help us make errors
building docs easier to read.

The issue is due to our Cinder driver passing the
entire share to the relevant API instead of just
the export path portion of the share.  This only
happens when the NFS image cache is full, and cached

This repo will be cloned by the puppet modules and used to install
modules in functional tests. The script uses r10k to deploy modules
from the Puppetfile because this is the Puppet Labs recommended way to
manage puppet environments, and it is a popular method among our users.
We install all modules from git, not the forge, because r10k does not
give us dependency resolution so installing from the forge does not buy
us anything. If the modules have stable branches in git, r10k uses the
stable branch as a ref, otherwise it uses a tag (pinning to a specific
release).

If zuul-cloner is available, the script first installs the external
modules with r10k, then extracts the OpenStack modules from the
Puppetfile to install with zuul-cloner. In the future, this part may be
split out into a JJB job.

Note: because r10k purges the modules directory before installing
modules, and this feature cannot be turned off[1], we must run r10k to
install the external modules before running zuul-cloner to install the
OpenStack modules.

Add callbacks for extention to the network resource so that interested
extensions can do custom logic when a network is created or updated.

Currently it will be done the same way port notifications are done -
i.e. only in ML2 plugin. We can revisit this in a floow up patch if the
whole notification logic should be moved somewhere else as this merits
further discussion which is out of scope for a mere patch.

This will be utilized in a follow up commit.

Adds delete_router for routers not created via create_network.
Adds list ports, list routers, list router ports

Network context:
setup: option of additional IPv6 network.
To support IPv6 tests over IPv4 infrastucture (as currently exists
in openstack gates), each instnace will have IPv4 with floating-ip as in
legacy mode. By doing that, we can test IPv6 networks by first connecting
to an IPv4 floating-ip.
dual-stack networks will be named with identical prefix to indicate they
belong to the same stack and connected to the same neutron router.

The code to generate the names of the patch ports
was based on a chunk of the bridge name starting from
the beginning. With the long suffix, this ended up
excluding all of the random characters in the name.
(e.g. br-int374623235 would create an interface br-in-patch-tun).

This meant that if two tests using patch interfaces ran together,
they would have a name collision and one would fail.

This patch updates the patch port name generation to use the
randomized back portion of the name.

Patch 4e77442d5 added a retry decorator to the API layer
to catch DB deadlock errors. However, when they occur, the
retried operation ends up being ineffective because the original
body has been altered, which leads the notification and validation
layers to barf exceptions due to unrecognized/unserializable elements.

This ultimately results to an error reported to the user.

To address this, let's make a deep copy of the request body, before
we pass it down to the lower layers. This allows the decorator to
work on a pristine copy of the body on every attempt. The performance
impact for this should be negligible.

Currently, we use constant value quorum=1 to check if there are enough
datapoints, however, this is not quite right for an alarm rule.

Image evaluation periods is set to, for i.e., 3 for an instance on
cpu_util greater or equal than 80%. Here are the cases which current
may not work as expected:

1. when system start or instance is just created, we may only get one
or two samples for the instance
2. when system is somewhere broken, or an instance is restarted (after
being shutoff), sample may fail to be collected in some time, so we only
get one or two sample in that time range

We want to avoid a spurious data peak, for example, instance cpu_util can
be 50%, 50%, 50%, 90%, in such case, alarm will not be triggered, but if
instance cpu_util is None, None, None, 90%, current code will think alarm
should be triggered, which is not consistent and may confuse end users.

This patch will put alarm to insufficient data when datapoints are less
than evaluation periods.

Conflicts:
        ceilometer/alarm/evaluator/threshold.py

NOTE(mriedem): The conflict is due to the oslo.i18n imports on master
and oslo.i18n wasn't used in stable/juno so the _LW usage is removed.

Dead loop scenario:

4. then we update alarm A with alarm_ids = B

* all threshold alarms are good alarms, which definitely have no dependency,
  so there is no dead loop
* all alarms depending only on good alarms are good alarms

it is disabled.
