There are times when a much more stripped down base image is desired
over the distro cloud images. For instance, Infra would like some base
images that do not have cloud-init or really much of anything else. This
is easy to accomplish with debootstrap and rinse.

Previously it was raising an exception in this case, which is
inconsistent to how ML2 was handling concurrent port_delete requests
further in the port delete function (log them but don't fail).

Oslo project decided to move away from using oslo.* namespace for all their
libraries [1], so we should migrate to new import path.

This patch applies new paths for:
- oslo.config
- oslo.db
- oslo.i18n
- oslo.messaging
- oslo.middleware
- oslo.rootwrap
- oslo.serialization
- oslo.utils

Added hacking check to enforce new import paths for all oslo libraries.

Updated setup.cfg entry points.

We'll cleanup old imports from oslo-incubator modules on demand or
if/when oslo officially deprecates old namespace in one of the next
cycles.

* The old usage.rst section was moved into the userguides/ section and

* The sections were organized according top to bottom in order of
  likelihood of utility to users. The guides will help people get
  started, the API docs will help them go from there, and anyone needing
  to customize lower-level things will have already scrolled through the

Ida532021e1287efed09343e8e546d0605355e889 has changed the way

When adds new microversion for nova REST API, we need add api sample
test. This patch adds new parameter to pass the requested API version.

For example to test v2.2 version of host API. It only adds new test
function in HostsSampleJsonTest:

    def test_host_get_v22(self):
        response = self._do_get('os-hosts/%s' % self.compute.host,
                                api_version='2.2')
        subs = self._get_regexes()
        self._verify_response('host-get-resp-2-2', subs, response, 200)

'api_version' is used to specifiy the requested version. And provide
template file for this version API's response.

This change tells libvirt to enable the BIOS bootmenu if the image
metadata (property-name ""hw_boot_menu"") or flavor extra spec
(name ""hw:boot_menu"") is configured to allow it.

In cases where both the image metadata and Extra Spec are set, the
Extra Spec setting is used.  This allows for flexibility in
setting/overriding the default behavior as needed.

The purpose of this spec is to define a standard for attaching meta data such

tempest. This specification should be enforced both for tests that are to live
in the tempest repository as well as tests that will eventually reside within

The recently split neutron-*aas need special treatment in release
scripts. The extra deliverables need to be uploaded to the same
Launchpad milestone page, and bugs should only be closed once (all
projects share the same Launchpad bug pages).

To this effect, we distinguish in the scripts the Launchpad concept
of project from the git project name as used in tarballs and skip
parts as needed. We also introduce an optional --deliverable option
to upload_release.py so that it can use different values for both.

Now that admin_endpoint, public_endpoint, and internal_endpoint
in the common library are working, these are the changes to use
them in the openstack-identity recipes.

This component already had different admin/internal/public
endpoints and manages them by using different names. (E.g.
'identity-admin', 'identity-internal', and 'identity-api')
This means...

1. No addition unit tests needed to be added. (No longer
   true. I went ahead and added some tests anyway.)

2. We should probably have a clean up pass at some point
   where we use the newly added infrastructure for admin,
   internal, and public endpoints for a single service
   name. This could be a disruptive change so I propose
   that we defer that clean up for now.

This patch adds support for a new task executor. This executor
leverages the taskflow library which is responsible for dispatching
the tasks.

The taskflow executor provides basic serial execution of the
tasks and uses eventlet by default. The execution mode is configurable
to have parallel execution in which case it is possible to also
configure the number of workers running at the same time.

Calling APIs from datasource drivers when the service is not enabled causes
exceptions. This is avoided by pre-checking the service enablement before
loading the datasource module for the service.

eg: If ceilometer is not enabled, ceilometer driver is not loaded.

Change includes a check in create service to check if the service corresponding
to the driver module being loaded is enabled by probing into keystone service
list.
Also harness is modified to first add the name of service in system_services
before calling createservice for services like ""engine"", ""api-rule"" etc.. so
that the check for service enablement is not done on these. (Obviously, there
are no services in keystone for the modules owned by the policy engine and
APIs.)
The createservice() function returns a True/False attribute before harness
tries to call initialization apis for the module like
get_schema/get_translators etc...

The datasources for which the services are not enabled are not listed for the
command ""openstack congress datasource list""

The clone_image method is enabled using a specific account

During tempest and Rally runs we've noticed occasional
LVM command hangs (lvs, vgs and pvs), we've also gathered
enough data to show that we see very slow response times from
these commands almost all of the time.

It turns out that this seems to be an issue with us scanning
all devices during LVM operations, including devices that may
be Cinder Volumes that are attaching and detaching from the system.

Inspecting a run instrumented with strace shows a number of LVM
commands timing out due to the device being scanned being removed
during scan, and the LVM command in turn waiting until it times out
on the scan that's in process.

This patch just adds the ability to setup a lvm.conf file in
/etc/cinder.  The Cinder LVM code will now specifically set
the LVM_SYSTEM_DIR environment variable to that directory for
each of the LVM scan commands in brick/local_dev/lvm.py.
If the system doesn't have the file, we use the empty string
which tells LVM to use it's defaults.  This only affects LVM
commands in Cinder, the idea is to ensure we don't impact any
other LVM operations on the node outside of Cinder and that we
behave as we always have in the case of no lvm.conf file being
setup in /etc/cinder.  The presence of the file is auto-detected
on brick/localdev/lvm init.

We'll update the OpenStack Devstack deployment scripts to put this
together and fix things up there first. Until that's done and until
we auto-generate the conf (or document it well), this will be a
*partial* bugfix.

I considered adding a default lvm.conf file to cinder/etc/<sample>
that would be copied in on install, but decided against this to
avoid any possible issues with compatability issues between
platforms or versions.

To use, just copy the /etc/lvm/lvm.conf file to /etc/cinder and
modify the filter as appropriate, for example:
  To use loopback device only:
    filter = [ ""a/loop/"", ""r/.*/"" ]
  If you have a physical drive like /dev/sdb1
    filter = [ ""a/dev/sdb1/"", ""r/.*/"" ]

Finally, this patch also goes through and cleans up our cmd
variables in brick/localdev/lvm.  We had a mix of using a
cmd array, and strings; this causes inconsistencies and makes
it difficult to extend or modify commands.  Switch everything to
using an array and use extend to provide the correct prefix.

Need to update docs to include a recommendation to create an
/etc/cinder/lvm.conf file and set device filters appropriately.

The spec will provide a base library of metadata definitions for
various common software products, components, and libraries that
may exist on particular image (or volume or instance). These
metadata definitions will make it easier for end users and
admins to easily describe the software and its properties.
This information will enable an improved and faster user
experience for applying software metadata, searching based
on software metadata, and viewing the software information
about an image.

Various improvements in horizon are underway to take
advantage of this metadata. For example, a user launching
an instance will be able to expand the image row to see
additional information about the image.  This will include
providing the metadata definition for properties on the image.
This same information will also be visible from the image and
instance details page.

CooperativeReader, being an eventlet-friendly wrapper around the
generator- based reader of image data, actually transforms
chunk-by-chunk iteration into the readable stream. It is used when the
image is being copied from the remote source: some generator-based
image data representing the remote source acts as its underlying
object, and the instance of CooperativeReader is passed as a data
stream to the backend client which uses it to read the data.

Before this patch, the CooperativeReader was ignoring the ""length""
parameter of the read method, always returning the whole chunk returned
by the underlying generator (in case of HTTP source the size of this
chunk is 16 M). This was causing problems for the clients attempting to
read data from it, and - under some circumstances - the loss of data.

For chunked storage of files in Swift a special class (ChunkReader,
declared in the swift store driver) is used to reduce the requested
read length so no extra data is read and transferred. However, this was
not working as the CooperativeReader (which was the underlying stream
for the ChunkReader) was ignoring the requested size. This was causing
the data to be lost when reading behind the boundaries of the Chunks.

This patchset introduces a buffer in the CooperativeReader to store the
most recently fetched iterator chunk. The reads are independent from
requests to iterator, so the CooperativeReader is able to return the
exact requested amount of bytes and no data is lost due to extra-reads.

This adds an option which enables package installation via
Yum when Puppet executes. Users might want to disable Yum
installation of packages via puppet when using pre-installed
images.

The option is off by default: meaning that Puppet will no
longer install packages by default. Users will need to
enable the EnablePackageInstall in order to get
the previous behavior.

The intent is to use the default_parameters section
of the Heat environment to allow users to cleanly enable this
features without wiring it into the top level. This is because
the new parameter is Puppet specific and doesn't really apply to
other implementations. Kilo Heat already has support for
default_parameters and so does python-heatclient.

NOTE: most TripleO users do not yet have the heatclient
features because setup-clienttools in tripleo-incubator only installs
releases via pip. It is for these reasons the default_parameters
section in overcloud-resource-registry-puppet.yaml is commented out
for now.

Currently find_resource() searches resource with human_id before does
with name_attr.  With this logic, find_resource() cannot identify
upper/lower case. In find_resource(), human_id always matches and
name_attr never used in find_resource() because human_id made from
small letters of name_attr string (see bug/1318503).

To identify upper/lower case, name_attr should be used before human_id.
This fix moves name_attr to ahead of human_id with unit-test cases.

There is a standard LBYL race that can better be addressed by making the
EAFP case safer.

Capture 409 Conflict during expect on PUT

Similarly to how the proxy handles 412 on PUT, we will gather 409
responses in the proxy during _connect_put_node.  Rather than skipping
backend servers that already have a synced copy of an object we will
accept their response and return 202 immediately.

This is particularly useful to internal clients who are using
X-Timestamp to sync transfers (e.g. container-sync and
container-reconciler).

No observable change in client facing behavior except that swift is
faster to respond Accepted when it already has the data the client is
purposing to send.

In the current state some constraints has no defined names
in the project.

So they are generated by DB engine automatically and each DB generates
constraint names in its own fashion. This makes difficult to operate
with constraints, for example in migrations, where they should be
referred by names.

SQLAlchemy provides the feature for generation of constraint names
using patterns.

Leveraging it will bring consistency to constraints naming
in the project.

- SQLite is no longer recommended to use for development as well
  as for production.
- Everything related to SQLite wiped out from DB migrations,
  so they no longer can be executed on SQLite.
  More specifically - `transform_table` helper was replaced with
  Alembic commands.
- Added special commands for those who still want to use SQLite:
    `register-models` - synchronizes models with DB with ""CREATE TABLE""
                        statements.
    `unregister-models` - opposite of previous command.
  With them you can avoid to use migrations and still be able to synchronize
  models with DB automatically.
- Added corresponding amendments to documentation.

Right now, nova-compute will attempt to build an infinite number of
instances, if asked to do so. This won't work on any machine, regardless
of the resources, if the number of instances is too large.

We could default this to zero to retain the current behavior, but
the current behavior is really not sane in any case, so I think we
should default to something. Ten instances for a single compute node
seems like as reasonable default. If you can do more than ten at a
time, you're definitely not running a cloud based on default config.

If a router is deleted concurrently while a router port is being bound,
the update query may fail because of the empty resultset.

To avoid this error, this patch moves the committed udpdate under the
same db context that validates that the port still exists, before the
update.

This change should not lead to unexpected surprises or unveil new
failure modes. Alternatively, it would be safer to catch the StaleDataError
and gracefully log that the router has been deleted while processing the
dvr binding.

This patch takes the bolder, and slightly cleaner approach.

This patch adds the MANAGEABLE state, and associated transitions to and
from AVAILABLE, as well as a new RPC method to initiate transitions
between provisioning states.

It also adds a new VERBS entity to ironic/common/states.py to hold the
action-phrases, as described in blueprint new-ironic-state-machine. This
provides a single place to check whether a requested target state is
allowed to be requested by checking if the value is ""in"" the keys of
this dictionary. It also provides a mapping for two phrases which are
currently inconsistent:
  target:deleted -> action:delete
  target:active  -> action:deploy

It updates the API controller for nodes.py without changing the HTTP
status codes which are returned in exception cases. The changes in unit
tests now prepare the node appropriately, but do not change the
assertions being tested.

Juno allowed the rebuild of a failed deploy to be initiated by PUTting
a target state of ""active""; this behavior, while inconsistent with the
new state machine, is added to the state model for compatibility, now
that stronger checking is done within the API service, based on the
actual modelling of state transitions.

There's some confusion about what the reset-state
call does.  It's not clear to some that this call
simply changes the state of the object in the data-base.

This patch just updates the help message to indicate more
clearly that reset-state ONLY changes state in the DB.

Currently we print traits list for each event when run event-list
command, but that is a lot of information. After system run for a
few days, the event-list command prints so much that it is not
convenient to know the whole event-list even with less command.

This patch adds a simple argument called --no-traits, it is False
by default, event-list will not print traits if this argument is
specified. Since this argument is boolean type, no need to assign
a value, if it is specified, then it is actived.

Reasons:
- to avoid gate overfilling, it is necessary to provide advanced
  way to lauch jobs, the most valid way is to use 'files'
  directive, similar to requirements job.

Changes:
- for each datastore check job was added 'files' directive except
  'mysql' job since in Trove it is required to run mysql
  test case for every patchsets, same thing for percona (since it
  is another mysql community flavor, and runs in
  Trove under shared mysql driver)
- 'files' directive include those files modification to which
  should lead to check job, for example:
  - 'files' for couchbase, postgresql includes
    guestagent/strategies/* files since those
    datastores are supporting backup/restore using Trove API

Duplicate imports of the same class + super() are not playing nicely
together, and our unit test base classes cause some dups in the extension
search path, breaking the service repos. This was not noticed earlier
in the extension moving process, because the temporary move code had a crude
mechanism to prevent the loading of same named extensions.

When we added microversion support to the API, the initial and minimum
version was set to 1.0. However, there were five previous API changes
since the Juno release which are not discoverable through the API
versioning scheme.

The 1.0 tag should actually indicate ""Juno stable API"". This patch
advances the minimum API version to 1.1, retroactively changing the
versions applied by two prior features:

* 1.1 -> 1.2 Rename NOSTATE to Available
* 1.2 -> 1.3 Add Node.driver_internal_info

Also, the default version applied (when no
X-OpenStack-Ironic-API-Version header is supplied) is raised to 1.1. A
client request that does not specify the header will retain the same
behavior as before this patch -- namely, the behavior prior to commit
I34bf7fa1b21580337c18206798dd8e9dfe11ba09. A client request which
specifies a version of 1.0 will result in an HTTP 406 Unsupported error
code today.

This patch leaves open the possibility for retroactively adding support
for the Juno API in future patches during the Kilo cycles, if necessary.

metadata service should be requested on 169.254.169.254:80 and router
namespace iptables rules redirect the request to the metadata-ns-proxy
on 127.0.0.1:$metadata_port. But currently the metadata-ns-proxy can be
requested directly on $router-ip:$metadata_port.

To avoid such behavior, this change marks packets redirection in mangle
table (PREROUTING), redirects (PREROUTING) them in nat table, accepts
them in filter table (INPUT) using the mark. Packets send to the
metadata proxy port without mark (so directly) are dropped. The
mark can be configured through the new option metadata_access_mark.

Remark: redirected packets are not local packets (in general), so
setting metadata proxy server host to 127.0.0.1 will disallow direct
queries but so redirected queries.

If the nas_ip and nas_share_path options are set, they
are used.  If not, the previous configuration mechanism,
based on loading a set of shares from a file configured
by <x>fs_shares_config will be used.

Also use nas_mount_options to replace
nfs_mount_options for consistency.  If nas_mount_options
is not set, nfs_mount_options will be used for

When SLAAC IPv6 subnet using external router advertisement
(ipv6_ra_mode=None, ipv6_address_mode=slaac) is added to a
dual-stack network, the device of dnsmasq or router gateway may
already be assigned with dynamic SLAAC IPv6 address. Current
code only checks for permanent address on a device when
initilizing the l3 address of that device. This results
assigning duplicated address to dhcp tap device, which leads
to dhcp agent failure.

This fix changes dhcp code to not init dynamic IPv6 address
on dhcp device so dynamic address can be auto-configured by
either internal or external RA device.

Currently in https.py, it tries to import poolmanager from
requests.packages.urllib3 first, if the module cannot be found,
it then turns to import poolmanager from urllib3.

It works fine for Linux based compute nodes, because the
requests.packages will be removed when installing python-requests,
see: http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/python-requests.git/tree/python-requests.spec#n88
However, in Windows hyper-v compute node, the module
requests.packages does be installed. So
requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager is imported and used.

We then registered a special ""glance+https"" schema into
poolmanager.pool_classes_by_scheme dict. However, when the request
is sent from glanceclient.common.http.py via self.session.request()
in _request() method, inside the self.session, it is hard coded to
use urllibs.poolmanager.pool_classes_by_scheme to get the
HttpsAdapter, which leads to this problem.

I compared the requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager and
urllib3.poolmanager, there are no differeces between them. So I
proposed to import the uniform poolmanager from urllib3 in this
patch.

1. set pecan_debug default to False, and user needs to enable it
   explicitly
2. set pecan_debug default to None, and if it is not set, then use
   global debug value

This patch chooses the second one.

Note: users who enable global debug while running ceilometer-api
under mod_wsgi with multiple processes need to disable pecan_debug
explicitly after this patch is merged, since previously the pecan_debug
will always be False if they don't configure it.

For target creation using tgtadm driver, we create a persistence
file for the target, then send a tgt-admin --update 'name' where
name is the specific persistence file we want to read in and update
from.

It turns out that we can hit race conditions where the persistence
file is written, and an update is requested but target has already
done work to make it believe that the target has already been created.

One thought was to just use ""update ALL"" but this still seems to have
issues, and changes the error to an account exists failure.

This patch takes the brute force approach and adds the cinder.utils
retry decorator to the tgt-admin --update command.  To do this
we just break out the tgt-admin --update call into it's own method
and add the decorator to it.

This patch is not going to be checked in. The only purpose for it is
to show code reviewers the usage of help-panel widget - an Angular
-based widget directive.

Please find the examples of usage in spalsh.html:
1) Inline help information in HTML format.
2) URL link of help HTML file via  ng-include.

Note:

1. the parent element of <help-panel> should have css style
overflow: hiddin, which makes sense for UI outer containers. In the
case a UI container have scrollable content, the content should be
hosted in a content container and the <help-panel> should not be a
child element of the content contianer.

2. To make the demo simple, I just use <body> as the container and set
the css style for it to be overflow: hidden. In real case, <body>
should not be a container for <help-panel>, unless the whole horizon
is a single-page web application.

Background:
Images that are stored in the cache folder will be stored in a folder whose
name is the image ID. In the event that an image is discovered to be no longer
used then a timestamp will be added to the image folder.
At each aging iteration we check if the image can be aged.
This is done by comparing the current nova compute time to the time embedded
in the timestamp. If the time exceeds the configured aging time then
the parent folder, that is the image ID folder, will be deleted.
That effectively ages the cached image.
If an image is used then the timestamps will be deleted.

When accessing a timestamp we make use of locking. This ensures that aging
will not delete an image during the spawn operation. When spawning
the timestamp folder will be locked and the timestamps will be purged.
This will ensure that a image is not deleted during the spawn.

In order to ensure that there is not a race between compute nodes each
compute node will have its own cache directory on the VMware datastore.

This is terrible costly when using more than one compute node (which is
a MUST for HA).

Due to the fact that we are using a nova lock utils if the compute nodes
have a shared file system then the locking is valid for all compute nodes.
In order to enable an administrator this option we provide a new

to access the wrong management_url:

and user show will not show the default project.  For getting
the project/tenant, if it is not present in the instances
information provided by user list --long, we don't actually
get the project/tenant, we just check to see if the user is
assigned to the given tenant/project.  For setting the
project/tenant, this is usually done with user create, but when
ldap is read-only, we have to use role add to add the user to a
default _member_ role and at the same time assign the user to a
given project/tenant.  This also adds support for using the
openstack $obj show commands which return --format shell output,
and return a hash of key/value pairs.

For each polling interval, Ceilometer compute agent will trigger
nova client directly to acquire the list of VMs.

However, there's a potential risk that the workload for nova client
will increases proportional to the number of Ceilometer compute
agents. In other word, there's a possibility that thousands of
ceilometer compute agents will call nova client in a very short time
period which may lead large number of requests to nova client in
short time. As a result, the nova client can not handle so many
requests in short time, and ceilometer compute agent can't fetch
metrics.

So we here shuffle agents to start polling task in order to fluff up
the time of sending request to nova or other components to avoid
large number of requests in short time. This would be more
performance effective and reliable.

Now Tempest supports JSON tests only without XML ones, but a
base baremetal client contains still an option for switching
de/serializers and it makes the code a little difficult.

Then, this patch moves JSON de/serializers for clarifying it
supports only JSON and easy code.
In addition, this patch removes ""object_type"" from serialize()
because now passed values are 'node', 'chassis' and  'port'
and they are not used for serializing at all.

The correct format for assertEqual is assertEqual(expected, actual),
but the usage is reveresed in a lot of places to be
assertEqual(actual, expected).

Now if unit tests fail on such an assertEqual, the output appears
reversed and can be potentially misleading while debugging failed
 tests as expected output will show up as 'actual'

This patch fixes all such reversed uses in test_volume.py
