Lockutils uses %0.3fs for time format, which gives us a convenient

gives us times like:

The REST API relies on neutron-specific policy checking logic that is
only available after the extensions are loaded and the
RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP is populated. This patch resets the policies
immediately after these steps are done. This ensures that in the event
the policies are prematurely loaded for any reason, the on-demand
loading of the policies will reload the policies and properly configure
the neutron specific checks on the next policy check.

and status of each test.  It also captures stdout/stderr and reports on that
as well; revealing that oslo.db's tests have a lot of deprecation
warnings in fact.

The display of this runner shows a lot more information than the
default testr/subunit thing which is somewhat useless, and for
those who are actually watching the test output, this is what
we'd most like to see.

Creates stepwise growing load.

This scenario runner launches the given benchmark scenario with stepwise
growing concurrency. Total times of run for each concurrency value is
expressed in current concurency value, multiplied by coefficient
""times_per_process"". When this times of run is performed, concurrency grows
on the ""step"" value, and scenario is launched again. Concurrency grows
until it reachs maximum possible value, that is lower or equal ""stop"".
Thus making the load on the cloud stronger. The stress scenario runner can
stop beforehand with a warning message in case the failure rate among all
scenarios being run exceeds the given maximum value.

    Config sample:
    ...
    {
        ""concurrency"": {
            ""start"": <number of concurrent scenarios which execute at the first
                      iteration>,

                     increased on each iteration>,
            ""stop"": <concurrency value, that should not be exceeded>
        },
        ""times_per_process"": <times task should be executed for each

                                    percent exceeds stop_on_failure_percent,
                                    task will be finished even if concurrency

This patch does a couple of things.  First it adds docstrings to the
client/server pair of the rpc interface used by the metadata service
to make calls back into the Neutron server.  The docs tell you where
the other side of the interface is found in the code, and where docs
are that give more info on the rules for changing them.

The second thing done in this patch is to scope this interface using a
messaging namespace.  Right now some plugins expose several interfaces
via the default namespace.  This effectively means they are a single
API and should be managed with a single version stream.  It's much
more managable to just treat these as separate interfaces and this
change makes that explicit and functionally true.  Now when a method
is invoked, the only classes considered for handling that request will
be ones marked with the right namespace.

No namespace usage is needed here.  This API is the only one exposed
via the DHCP agent, so the default namespace used now is fine.

The DhcpAgent class was updated to explicitly define the
messaging.Target().  Previously it was using the equivalent one
defined in the Manager base class.  Having it specified here makes it
more obvious that this is an rpc endpoint, and also provides the
obvious place that must have the version updated if the interface is
changed.

Part of blueprint rpc-docs-and-namespaces.

The call to flows.manager.create_volume.get_flow in cinder.volume.manager's
create_volume method is passing in keyword args where the flows manager is
actually expecting positional arguments. The good thing is that most of these
seem to evaluate to boolean values and are evaluated as True, so they don't
fail; however the behavior isn't going to be exactly as expected here.

The method signature in flows.manager.create_volume:

This adds a deprecation helper/utility that libraries can use
to aid in deprecated common patterns; for example a class that
was moved to another location, renamed kwarg, a moved property
or a moved inheritable class...

These patterns are hopefully useful for the various oslo libraries
to use in the future as deprecation becomes an important way to
change the various oslo libraries in ways that does not break
compatibility.

This module originates from taskflow where it has been used for
similar purposes for a little while now. The current recommendation
is that this (or similar logic) should be used for developer to
developer interactions (and not for developer to deployer
interactions, which should use versionutils and its logging
mechanism instead).

To enable these types of messages one the following will have to
be used with the library using program:

$ python -Wonce $program
$ python -Wall $program

Or inside the program binaries (like in cinder):

    import warnings
    warnings.simplefilter('once', DeprecationWarning)

It can also be plugged into the logging system via:

https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging.captureWarnings

Or something like:

http://paste.ubuntu.com/9431665/

There are some duplicated and useless policy enforcement at nova-network
FlatManager. The floatingip related function just stubbed out for FlatManager
and the same policies already enforcement at network api layer:

https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/669e1c5d3ad2fd6bdaff69c0805bbb87da509036/

If the request violated the policy rule, the network api layer enforcement will
stop the request, it nerver can reach the nova network manager side.

This patch just clean them up.

Smith,gary-w-smith,"Add support for volume transfers

Cinder supports volume transfers, which are transfers of ownership from
one project to another.  The normal flow is that a donor creates a volume
transfer, captures the resulting transfer id and secret authentication
key, and passes that information out of band to the recipient (such as
by email, text message, etc.).  The recipient then accepts the transfer,
supplying the transfer id and authentication key.  The ownership of the
volume is then transferred from the donor to the recipient, and the
volome is no longer visible to the donor.

It is important to know of some limitations about the cinder API for
volume transfers and their impact on the UI design.
1. When creating a volume transfer, you cannot specify who the intended
   recipient will be, and anyone with the transfer ID and auth key can
   claim the volume.  Therefore there is no UI to prompt for a
   recipient.
2. Current volume transfers are only visible to the donor; users in
   other projects are unable to view these transfers.  This makes it
   pointless to create a project table to view and accept volume
   transfers, since the current transfers are not visible.  Instead, the
   transfer information has been added to the volume details, which are
   visible by the donor, and the volume state clearly reflects that a
   transfer has been created.  It it also impossible to present to the
   recipient a pull-down list of transfers to accept.
3. The only time that the authorization key is visible to the donor is
   in the response from the creation of the transfer; after creation it
   is impossible for even the donor to recover it.  Since the donor must
   capture the transfer ID and authorization key in order to send it to
   the recipient, an extra form was created to present this information
   to the donor immediately after the transfer has been created.  It is
   not enough to put the information in a success message, since these
   are typically only displayed for a small number of seconds before
   they disappear.

This commit switches the cleanup function from having a hardcoded
assumption that there will only ever be 1 subunit stream stored in
the testrepository. Instead it uses the testr last command to retrieve
the most recent stream and uses that instead. This will be needed if
we start pre-seeding testrepository with data from previous runs.

We have a race condition where the call to create an
iscsi target seems to be issued twice.  This patch
adds some debug logging to try and get some more info
around where things are going wrong.

First, we add a log message to the intialize_connection call
in the cinder.volume.api and include the connector info.

Second, we add a target show output prior to the update/create
command in the target driver.

In addition, we also had the update and show commands in the same
try/except block which led us to believe the show was failing,
but that's NOT the case at all.  So this patch also moves that
existing show (debug purposes as well) out of the main try block.

Note that there are some old bugs logged against TgtAdm for issues
with it ""loosing count"" of target id's it's issued, and in turn
reissuing the same ID multiple times.  This patch is intended to
give us enough info to determine if that's what's going on or not.

Other possibility is that the initialize call is being issued more
than once.

when using lbaas haproxy session persistence of type HTTP_COOKIE, the
lbaas haproxy driver creates haproxy config with entries for pool
members, in which the value of 'cookie' argument is placed in session
cookies and used to route requests to correct pool member, ensuring
session persistence, but when a new pool member is created or deleted,
a new cookie value for member is created. This causes old HTTP sessions
to be routed to new pool member, and session is broken.
Fixes the problem by using member id as cookie value.

While transitioning to the new driver and target
model (change 9651f547147188645942466602c92cce06666483)
some things got lost not surprisingly.  One of those
things that wasn't migrated correctly was the
iscsi_write_cache option due to ensure_export not
being called properly on service restart.

This patch cleans up the ensure/create_export methods
and their signatures.  Most importantly esnure_export
should now actually work and check the iscsi_write_cache
settings.

While fixing this I also cleaned up the two methods
mentioned above to eliminate the unnecessary and
duplicate info in their arguments.

The whole service catalog is embedded in every token, and by default
all token responses are logged at DEBUG. This adds a huge amount of
basically const data into system logs, over and over and over again.

We should not log the service catalog by default on every token
response. The following replaces the service catalog with the token

This provides the watchdog.watch function which is a contextmanager
that can be used before doing operations that have a high risk of
deadlocking or aberrantly taking huge amounts of time to complete
(which could be the root cause for other issues).

Unit tests require the use of sleep to make the timers pop either
before or after the event in question. There is 1 second buffer that's
encoded into each scenario which should be sufficient for unit tests
(even in busy systems). If that turns into an issue later, the buffer
can be increased (I was only seeing real skew of 1-2 ms locally).

This patch contains a few changes to the state model.

The first is a fix for an issue caught by Ruby in post-merge review:

- fsm.py initialize() did not set _target_state, which led to some
  incorrect calculations during subsequent state transitions.

Additionally, in the Juno release, the DEPLOYDONE state was exposed only
on the target_provision_state field, and never set as the current
provision state.

- Commit b49470e1 incorrectly expressed DEPLOYDONE as a current
  provision state. With this patch, current provision state transitions
  from DEPLOYING directly to ACTIVE, as it did in Juno. A subsequent
  patch should introduce the DEPLOYED state.

- In accordance with bp/new-ironic-state-machine, target_provision_state
  is changed from DEPLOYDONE to ACTIVE during the deploy phase.

Similarly, in the Juno release, the DELETED state was exposed only
on the target_provision_state field.

- In accordance with bp/new-ironic-state-machine, target_provision_state
  is changed from DELETED to NOSTATE (which will become AVAILABLE)
  during the deletion phase.

The keystoneclient tests were using the library installed from a

use the keystoneclient installed to the venv.

Doing a `git clone` causes problems on any system without reliable
Internet access, and since the keystoneclient tests have changed to
being for functional tests rather than for verifying
backwards-compatibility of the client, this will make things easier.

The ring builder's placement algorithm has two goals: first, to ensure
that each partition has its replicas as far apart as possible, and
second, to ensure that partitions are fairly distributed according to
device weight. In many cases, it succeeds in both, but sometimes those
goals conflict. When that happens, operators may want to relax the
rules a little bit in order to reach a compromise solution.

Imagine a cluster of 3 nodes (A, B, C), each with 20 identical disks,
and using 3 replicas. The ring builder will place 1 replica of each
partition on each node, as you'd expect.

Now imagine that one disk fails in node C and is removed from the
ring. The operator would probably be okay with remaining at 1 replica
per node (unless their disks are really close to full), but to
accomplish that, they have to multiply the weights of the other disks
in node C by 20/19 to make C's total weight stay the same. Otherwise,
the ring builder will move partitions around such that some partitions
have replicas only on nodes A and B.

If 14 more disks failed in node C, the operator would probably be okay
with some data not living on C, as a 4x increase in storage
requirements is likely to fill disks.

This commit introduces the notion of ""overload"": how much extra
partition space can be placed on each disk *over* what the weight
dictates.

For example, an overload of 0.1 means that a device can take up to 10%
more partitions than its weight would imply in order to make the
replica dispersion better.

Overload only has an effect when replica-dispersion and device weights
come into conflict.

The overload is a single floating-point value for the builder
file. Existing builders get an overload of 0.0, so there will be no
behavior change on existing rings.

In the example above, imagine the operator sets an overload of 0.112
on his rings. If node C loses a drive, each other drive can take on up
to 11.2% more data. Splitting the dead drive's partitions among the
remaining 19 results in a 5.26% increase, so everything that was on
node C stays on node C. If another disk dies, then we're up to an
11.1% increase, and so everything still stays on node C. If a third
disk dies, then we've reached the limits of the overload, so some
partitions will begin to reside solely on nodes A and B.

The AlarmCreationBolt now caches AlarmDefinitions and Alarms for
quicker evaluation of incoming metrics. Incoming metrics end up in one
of these buckets:

1. Fits into an existing Alarm
2. Causes a new Alarm to be created
3. Already exists in an existing Alarm

All of these require the analysis of existing Alarms. I tried writing SQL
to do this analysis but it just wasn't fast enough so instead I added
the caching of the Alarm Definitions and Alarms.

The AlarmCreationBolt now needs to process Alarm deletion message so
that stream from the EventProcessingBolt had to be hooked up to the
AlarmCreationBolt.

The AlarmCreationBolt used to incorrectly handle
Alarm Definition Updated events.

Improved the queries in AlarmDAOImpl to be more efficient by using
fewer queries intsead of multiple queries per Alarm. However the
AlarmDAOImplTest now requires a real mysql instance since the h2
emulator doesn't understand ""group_concat"". Mark that test as
only run for target integration-test

Turn on tests for target integration-test

Previous code was not reusing Metrics from existing Alarms
all times it should have. Added test for this case

A patchset being provided so people can have a look and a play and
make some comments on how things are structured. If we like this
I'll make a proper patchset for real review, one that takes
advantage of the learnings we do on this one. Since this is a fairly
significant change, I'd much rather have early commentary.

run tests with:

   tox -egabbi

It requires mongodb, which tox will start for you.

In order to limit the number of services required, a new publisher
is made available. It is called 'direct' and directly calls the
DatabaseDispatcher to write samples to the metering database. This
means that no messaging bus is required. A stripped down
gabbi_pipeline.yaml is provided to the test harness.

Note that this review isn't really expected to pass all the tests.
It's here primarily to provide an easy way to access the branch that
the code is on so that people may hack on it. That hacking should
lead to a better understanding of how fixtures need to work and
the kinds of inspection required in response testing.

The tests were assuming that extension drivers (such as federation
and revoke_api) were always loaded. These drivers were only
available because a previous test had imported the module and its
factory method is stored in global state in the dependency module.

The base Testcase is changed to not set up the saml2 and oauth1
auth plugins by default. The saml2 auth plugin depends on the
federation API which is only available when the extension is
loaded; similarly for the oauth1 auth plugin.

A new method is added to base TestCase to allow the TestCase to
provide more drivers to load during setUp. The TestCases that need
to load an optional backend make use of it.

In an attempt to make the proposal bot changes for requirements be
more meaningful make the update.py script return something that's more
user friendly.

Now by default the script will return the following to stdout on success:

Version change for: mox, mox3, testrepository, testtools
Updated project/test-requirements.txt:
    mox==0.5.3                     ->   mox>=0.5.3
    mox3==0.7.3                    ->   mox3>=0.7.0
    testrepository>=0.0.13         ->   testrepository>=0.0.17
    testtools>=0.9.27              ->   testtools>=0.9.32

Add a verbose flag that will provide much of the previous debug info.

Eliminate the giant dict dump of all the requirements files, as that
was largely impossible to make sense of, and rarely provided any
insight. During a devstack run you'll have git hashes for all the
trees, so can track down exact file contents if needed.

By making this the default stdout we can then capture and use this for
the git commit messages.

In order to make the test output matching human readable ignore the 80
column limit for the expected blocks via #noqa.

When a users quota for any given service is zero, the pie charts
showing this remain empty. This is not helpful behaviour, as an
empty chart indicates available quota - only the numeric values
show that the current quota is filled, making the chart redundant.
We changed the charts to be full when a quota is zero, as this
gives an earlier visual indication that the user has no available
quota.

The try...except statement that was merged in order to debug the
JSONDecodeError exception that we get sporadically in the functional tests
does not re-raise the exception, thus hiding the problem in a way. So
what ends up happening is that we see a bunch of tests fail with HTTP

exception, which makes it apparent that we are getting another

These were pretty simple tests but were relying on creating the snapshot
and image mappings in the database for some setup and as parts of the
utility methods (when get raises NotFound, create the mapping and return
an id).

The DB API functionality doesn't need to be tested here, that's done in
the actual objects unit tests for these in
nova.tests.unit.objects.test_ec2, the only DB API that needs to be
mocked out here is the create methods since we can't do that with the
object's create method.

To be fair, this is a bit uglier compared to the previous tests (which
were admittedly cleaner), but this does decouple the database from the
unit tests which is an ongoing goal for unit test refactor.

We have 3-stages based deployment model.

Pre/Post stages deploys by tasks, and all dependencies will be
managed on tasks level. Parameter 'role' will serve as mapper to
nailgun node entities

Main deployment will be roles-based (where each role is group of tasks),
and we need to show that tasks and groups is different things, and therefore
edges that connect task to group, and group to tasks is different and will
be treated differently in nailgun. For this purpose two additional
parameters are introduced:

groups - specify dependency from task to all groups, where this task will be applied
tasks - specify dependency from group to all required tasks

Parameter role in task for main deployment will be used as mapper for nailgun nodes entities

There are several changes required for each puppet module split
that are a bit 'tedious' to do one-at-a-time. Instead, let's do them once and merge them
up front since it doesn't break anything. It is also easier to review them all at once &
keep them consistent, than to review the similar change across n patches.

Add all parts needed to add the puppet-* as a split out
module except for the gerrit/project.yaml change.

After this change merges, each puppet module will require a project-config patch containing
only 1 file modification: gerrit/project.yaml (which is what requires core support because
it merges in the sub-treed puppet module into -infra)

Only the modules specificially included this the spec [1] are addressed. All
others are out of scope.

The username and password combination is considered insecure to store in
the metadata passed to the stack as they can easily be obtained and
possibly used in an unathorized manner by logging into one of the
registration systems. The use of an activation key is more desirable
as it can only be used in conjunction with subscription-manager to
register a RHEL system.

This patch deprecates the username and password support from the script
that registers RHEL with either Satellite or RH Customer Portal during
boot-time.  This patch also adds a warning if the username and password
combination is used in the stack metadata. The documentation and examples
have also been updated to warn operators of the deprecation of username
and password.

This patch does not affect the username and password support for
registration activities while building images with diskimage-builder.

Previously the REG_REPOS value was a space delimited list of repo

If you pass a list in json through the heat parameter, the output
is the string representation of a python list of unicode vaules.
This patch changes the rhel-registration scripts to process the

Instead mapping every possible devstack option up into a devstack gate
variable, we should probably just provide the ability to provide some
devstack config passthrough from the job definitions. This should be
able to reduce the number of DEVSTACK_GATE variables that we need, as
anything that maps 1 to 1 with a devstack variable should be just put
into the DEVSTACK_LOCAL_CONFIG var.

This commit fixes some issues with the jobs that get run on tempest-lib
commits. First since the install lib from release stuff landed in
devstack there isn't a reason to be running any tempest job that
doesn't install tempest-lib from source. So this patch removes those.
Additionally, this removes the pypy check job because I don't think
there is really an expectation of pypy support.

This commit creates the basic observer hierarchy for advanced
services, as part of a multi-step refactoring effort of the L3 agent.

The change set has these modifications:

- Focuses on FWaaS changes for this refactoring.
- Creates a FirewallService instance.
- Loads device driver using the service.
- UT updated to test new methods and refactoring changes.

The next steps (future commit) will be to define handlers for events of
interest for FWaas (moving logic out of the L3 agent).

This change is part of a multi-part change set to handle obsolete and
graduated oslo modules. This commit handles the wsgi module. The way
in which other projects appear to have handled this situation is to
copy the wsgi module into the project. See, for example,
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/129260/

I've done the same thing, and since we already have a wsgi module in
trove/common, I've called the newly imported module base_wsgi.py and
renamed the imports accordingly.

In the fullness of time, we could consider merging wsgi.py and
base_wsgi.py

However since there are internal dependencies between
middleware/context.py and wsgi.py (within oslo-incubator) I can't
delete or modify those files.

This change has been rebased on

This new common utilities module created for being
a front-end API for neutron services to the Barbican
TLS containers API and parsing TLS certificate data.

Includes a Barbican implementation of CertManager.

The CertManager interface exposes the following API:

* store_cert(certificate, private_key, intermediates=None,
  private_key_passphrase=None)
  Stores a TLS Certificate in the active backend.

* get_cert(cert_ref, check_only)
  Returns TLS Certificate data fetched from the active backend.

* delete_cert(cert_ref)
  Deletes the TLS Certificate (or soft-deletes / unregisters,
  depending on the active backend).

The CertParser module exposes the following API:

* validate_cert(certificate, private_key=None,
  private_key_passphrase=None, intermediates=None)
  Validate that the certificate is a valid PEM encoded X509 object.

* get_host_names(certificate)

Adding version 1.3.7

1.3.x angular is needed for Horizon launch instance work.

This was dependent on the following (done):
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/142520/
Xstatic-Angular 1.3.7 includes the following packages:
XStatic-Angular-Cookies
XStatic-Angular-Mock

They can be removed, but this apparently needs to be done
in a multi-step process. The interdependency chain,
(horizon has dependency on the old packages) causes
an integration test to fail. So, if we follow the normal
process, then we have to do it in the following order.
1) The newer pakage has to be added to global requirements
2) a) The new dependency has to be added to Horizon
   b) Old dependencies must be removed from Horizon
3) The older packages must be removed from global requirements
   - change 145096

Note: This patch includes the 1.3.7 dependency update, but
that will be handled by the auto update when global requirements
is merged and this should rebase automatically on top of that.

This commit removes images that are in the repository though
not referenced by any documents.

The steps followed to build this list are as follows:
Get list of images in repo:
find fuel-docs/_images/ -type f|awk -F ""/"" \
{'print $NF'}|sort|uniq>repo-images.txt

Find referenced images in RSTs:
egrep -r "".png|.jpg|.svg"" `find fuel-docs/pages \
-name \*rst -type f`|awk -F ""/"" {'print $NF'}| \
sort|uniq>used-images.txt

Get list of unused images:
comm -2 -3 repo-images.txt used-images.txt>unused-images.txt

Find list of images referenced with wildcard and exclude
those from the list of images to be removed:
grep -r ""_images/"" *|egrep ""\*""

Check for images referenced in _templates and exclude
those as well:
egrep -r "".png|.jpg|.svg"" _templates/*

Adds a YAML file describing all of the projects that live in the
openstack/ code namespace. The description of projects is done according
to a set of fields that are documented and defined in a JSONSchema
document project-schema.json. The fields describing the projects
correspond to what I feel are useful for governance purposes, as well as
for end users and operators.

The impetus for this approach is described in this blog post:

http://www.joinfu.com/2014/09/so-what-is-the-core-of-openstack/

Note that the four release models that are used in the project
JSONSchema:

- coordinated-managed
- coordinated
- compatible
- rolling

Correspond to Thierry's excellent description of the various release
models from the comments on review #125786.

OK, discuss.

The functional test job of some openstack projects (e.g. neutron) uses devstack
to set up the environment for the functional tests. This currently involves
running devstack to get the service installed, and then running unstack because
the tests do not want the service actually running.

Thus it would be convenient if we had a way to tell devstack to stop after
installing the enabled services, and not actually start them.

We add a configuration option START_OPENSTACK_SERVICES which defaults to True
to preserve existing behavior. Setting this option to False will prevent
OpenStack services from starting.

Re-organize some config_, init_, and start_ functions to simplify the flow
where the option is checked. Also add a post-start phase for services, called
""commission_"" where setting up of resources is done by some services.

When we were in the process of working on brick libs
we did quite a bit of funky stuff with setting a member
variable for each class to point to an executor that was
passed in during init.

There's no longer any reason to do this with the target drivers,
so we should simplify our lives a bit and go back to using the
good old cinder.utils wrapper.

It's also believed that the use of the member variable is
susceptible to some concurrency issue that was causing the
wrong cmd string to be executed.  We'll mark this as closing
that bug and reopen if we still see the signature in Kibana.

This patch migrates the keystone_tenant provider to use the universal
openstack client instead of the keystone client. It uses the openstack
parent provider in openstacklib to handle multiple authenticating
methods. The keystone_tenant type uses the openstacklib openstack
utility to add a new auth parameter to the keystone_tenant type.

This patch also moves functionality for parsing keystone.conf for the
service token back to the keystone module from openstacklib. It creates
three tiers of inheritance: Keystone_tenant < Keystone < Openstack, so
that keystone-specific functionality can stay in keystone.

It also adds a flush method which should help improve performance.

2 iptables rules are defined to ensure the metadata proxy is reachable
from vms on 169.254.169.254:80:
* REDIRECT 169.254.169.254:80 packets to the router on port 9697
* ACCEPT traffic to 127.0.0.1 on port 9697

The REDIRECT rule replaces destination ip by:
 * 127.0.0.1 if the packet is local,
 * router ip (the one on the input interface, metadata proxy case).

So ACCEPT rule filter is not matched ... the metadata proxy is only
reachable because INPUT policy is ACCEPT.

This change removes the destination constraint in the ACCEPT rule.

After working on a formal model of the current state machine, it became
apparent that the diagram in this spec did not match the behavior in the
Juno release. The representation of ""momentary"" states is misleading --
these were never saved in or written to the node.provision_state field,
and were instead just return values from function calls.

As the diagram was thus misleading, this patch replaces the diagram
based on the actual behavior in the Juno release.

This patch provides an alternate implementation of
the OS::TripleO::Controller::SoftwareConfig which uses Puppet
to drive the configuration. Using this it is possible
to create a fully functional overcloud controller instance
which has the controller node configured via Puppet
stackforge modules. Initially this includes only the
following services:

  MySQL
  RabbitMQ
  Keepalived/HAProxy (HA is not yet fully supported however)
  Nova
  Neutron
  Keystone
  Glance (file backend)
  Cinder

Using these services it is possible to run devtest_overcloud.sh
to completion. The idea is that we can quickly add more
services once we have CI in place.

In order to test this you'll want to build your images
with these elements:

   os-net-config
   heat-config-puppet
   puppet-modules
   hiera

None of the OpenStack specific TripleO elements
should be used with this approach (the nova/neutron
elements were NOT used to build the controller image).

Also, rather than use neutron-openvswitch-agent to configure
low level networking it is recommended that os-net-config
by configured directly via heat modeling rather than
parameter passing to init-neutron-ovs. This allows us to
configure the physical network while avoiding the coupling to
the neutron-openvswitch-element that our standard
parameter driven networking currently uses. (We still need
to move init-neutron-ovs so that it isn't coupled and/or deprecate
its use entirely because the heat drive stuff is more flexible.)

Packages may optionally be pre-installed via DIB using the
-p option (-p openstack-neutron,openstack-nova) etc.

This patch changes the logic of the NSX plugin in order to prevent
backend operations to be performed within a DB transaction.
Doing so increases the chances of triggering deadlocks due to
eventlet yielding in the middle of a transaction.

For floating IPs the risk is higher because they allocate IP
addresses on external networks, where the level of contention is
much higher than internal ones.

The logic of the floating IP operations has been changed to not
rely anymore on _update_fip_assoc to implement the floating IP
rules on the backend. Once the DB operation completes successfully,
the rules are implemented on the backend. In case of backend
failure the floating IP is put in error status, with the exception
of the case where the floating IP has just been created, in which
instead the DB operation is reverted by deleting the floating IP.

This example extends the controller software configuration
so that heat metadata is used to model the os-net-config
YAML (ultimately JSON) directly. The existing
os-net-config element already supports this format.

Configuring the physical network layer in this manner
would supplant the ever growing list of Heat parameters
that we have and is something that could be automatically
generated via tuskar.

The default is to use net-config-noop.yaml which
will pass no config metadata into the os-net-config
element which will essentially disable it in favor
of using parameters w/ init-neutron-ovs.

The default setting for oslo.db is TRADITIONAL for mysql_sql_mode;
this is set up in oslo_db/options.py as well as
in EngineFacade; however, the provisioning system currently does not
use these options or EngineFacade, and the default for
mysql_sql_mode in the base session.create_engine() is None.
For a MySQL/MariaDB database where this is not established in my.cnf,
tests will run without TRADITIONAL SQL mode and some tests will fail,
including some Nova migration tests that rely upon this.

This patch resolves that as well as the warning we see
in tests regarding the empty SQL mode.

A combination of issues with puppet and rspec-puppet make it impossible
for rspec-puppet to properly load puppet/util/openstack when other
modules run tests against puppet-keystone. This patch works around the
issue by adding all directories in lib/puppet to the $LOAD_PATH prior

Keystone client utilizes the auth_url provided to it in order to
discover the appropriate end point for the action. It will either use
the publicURL or the adminURL it gets in the service catalog for the
identity service. UNLESS caller to the keystone client hard sets the
endpoint key, in which case keystone will blindly use it instead of
looking in the catalog. Because rally was setting it, rally also had to
set it differently when doing admin level stuff, but rally doesn't have
to do that at all. Rally can rely on the service catalog and let
keystone sort it out.

This change removes manually setting endpoint and just passes along the
auth_url to keystone. This obviates the need to define an admin_port in
a deployment configuration, and reduces the number of tests that need to
be ran.

A warning will be issued if a deployment defines an admin_port, however
the admin_port itself will be ignored. This provides some backwards
compatibility with existing deployments.

We have several requirements for graph storages, that will
satisfy all parties:

- Store graph definition externally to nailgun, in fuel-library,
  because fuel-library devs should be able to modify graph configuration,
  based on changes in puppet modules
- Validate any data that nailgun will store, and validation should
  happen at the time data is received by nailgun
- It should be possible to migrate data to required format, on upgrade,
  if we will decide that it is necessary
- It should be possible to modify graph per cluster, and per release,
  for flexibility of debugging and development, also it may
  help with maintenance tasks

To solve this issues 2 db fields was added:

Cluster.deployment_tasks
Release.deployemtn_tasks

It will be possible to read/modify both of this fields by next api request:

GET/PUT release/<rel_id>/deployment_tasks
GET/PUT cluster/<cluster_id>/deployment_tasks

Also note that deployment configuration for old release will be stored in
nailgun code in orchestrator/graph_configuration.py module

all works fine, but unfortunately the ""auth_url"" will be replaced

endpoint may be unavailable if we're working through some

As workaround, we can explicitly create a keystone client for v2.0,
and none of discovering will be performed and the endpoint will not
be replaced implicitly by keystone client.

The new drbd driver has a couple needed 3'rd party libs
that aren't in the global requirements.  That means that
any time there's an attempt to import the driver things
blow up due to import errors.

The great thing is that the author took care of things in
unit tests by creating mocks, but we still have the problem
of the driver itself, and this causes us to be unable to do
things like genconfig.

This patch just wraps the 3'rd party libs into a try/catch
block, sets them to None if they're not on the system.

Also, move the global dbus.array variable into init and
make it a member variable.

In case of DHCPv6 stateless subnets, we should inform DHCP clients about
other configuration values available from DHCP server. This is done by
setting O (other) flag in RAs, which is controlled by AdvOtherConfigFlag
setting in radvd case.

Since radvd configuration file becomes quite complex, migrated its
generation to Jinja2.

Added a basic unit test that checks that flag is set for stateless mode
and not SLAAC. For stateful, it doesn't really matter whether other flag
is set, so no need to expect any value of it.

No more unit tests seem to be needed: conditional prefix generation is
already covered in test_l3_agent, and other statements are common for
all ipv6_ra_modes.

This patch provides an alternate implementation of
the OS::TripleO::Compute::SoftwareConfig which uses Puppet
to drive the configuration. Using this it is possible
to create a fully functional overcloud compute instance
which has the compute node configured via Puppet
stackforge modules.  This includes all the Nova, Neutron,
and Ceilometer configuration required to make things work.

In order to test this you'll want to build your images
with these elements:

 os-net-config
 heat-config-puppet
 puppet-modules
 hiera

None of the OpenStack specific TripleO elements
should be used with this approach (the nova/neutron/ceilometer
elements were NOT used to build the compute image).

Also, rather than use neutron-openvswitch-agent to configure
low level networking it is recommended that os-net-config
by configured directly via heat modeling rather than
parameter passing to init-neutron-ovs. This allows us to
configure the physical network while avoiding the coupling to
the neutron-openvswitch-element that our standard
parameter driven networking currently uses. (We still need
to move init-neutron-ovs so that it isn't coupled and/or deprecate
its use entirely because the heat drive stuff is more flexible.)

Packages may optionally be pre-installed via DIB using the
-p option (-p openstack-neutron,openstack-nova).

So there's a major problem in the iscsi code (and has been
for quite some time).  The tgt show command sometimes seems
to be corrupt and the issued command is actually a tgt create.
The result is that we already have a tgt and the call raises
which then causes the operation to fail.

An example of the issue:
  Stdout: Unexpected error while running command.Command:
  sudo cinder-rootwrap /etc/cinder/rootwrap.conf tgt-admin
  --update iqn.2010-10.org.openstack:volume-f055d3c5-db7a-
  484e-9d0d-b98495439413
  Exit code: 22
  Stdout:
  Command:tgtadm -C 0 --lld iscsi --op new --mode target
  --tid 1 -T iqn.2010-10.org.openstack:volume-f055d3c5-db7a-
  484e-9d0d-b98495439413
  exited with code: 22.
  Stderr: u'tgtadm: this target already exists

What's disturbing however is that in that section of code
we're sending a --op show!!  Could be something we're
doing with our member executor?  Or maybe something to
do with the new oslo concurrency code?

Regardless, his patch intends to provide a clear marker for
ER in the case that create export fails due to the
target entry already existing.

Also this patch will enable us to go ahead and just use
the existing target rather than bomb out and fail everything.
Root cause of why we're getting a second create is still
unknown and needs addressed, but this might help in getting
more info as well as keeping things stable until we address
the root issue.

This change is part of a multi-part change set to handle obsolete and

that is now obsolete. The change here is to delete the file from

modules that used to include exception.

The change is modeled on the change that was implemented in
oslo-incubator when this module was deprecated. See review
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/39314

wsgi.py will be deprecated in another change so the only change being
made here is (effectively) to extensions.py

We can't delete the file in openstack/common because there is still a

delete_subnet in Ml2 plugin instead of using SELECT FOR
UPDATE deletes the IPAllocations that can be auto-deleted
straight away.
An exception is raised if there are ports that cannot be
autodeleted.

delete_network in ML2 plugin tries to delete all ports
and subnets before performing the network deletion.
No lock is needed here - if some other process modifies
the Port or Subnet table, adding new items, the network
deletion will fail because of a violation of a foreign
key contraint.
In that case the operation will be retried.

Copy all of TMP_MOUNT_PATH into the ramdisk so that

Includes a workaround for a bug in Dracut that caused the copy
to fail.

Also moves init instead of copying it so we don't conflict with
the Dracut init.

to api, which will cause problem when we sync with oslo-incubator.

This patch simply uses client as an alias of api.

XenAPI.  This fixes that breakage
