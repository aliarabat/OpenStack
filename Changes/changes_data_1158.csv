In debugging a failing test (test_update_heartbeat) I observed that
the test was asserting incorrect values and also that the order of
parameters to assertEqual were inverted. It appears that the order of
parameters to assertEqual is a more widespread problem.

The correct order makes the assertion message more useful.

Per discussion on the mailing list [1], I think moving to
implementing a full plugin with appropriate mixins is the
preferred approach for OVN. OVN implements it's own control

ML2 drivers since OVN can also control physical devices

The swift functional test job was changed to run
tox -e func as sudo [1]. The job first runs functional tests
against keystone, then repeats the tests against tempauth.
The second part of the job requires SWIFT_TEST_CONFIG_FILE
env var to be set to cause the tests to run against tempauth.
The introduction of sudo in [1] causes this env var to be lost,
so the tests run against keystoneauth again.

A tell-tale is that the second run of the functional tests should
output ""SKIPPING FUNCTIONAL TESTS SPECIFIC TO AUTH VERSION 3"" before
the first line of test results. This has been missing since [1] was
merged.

The patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/138562 fixes
the problem of qrouter or snat namespaces of deleted routers
being left behind on controller nodes. Infrequently the
snat namespaces are still being left behind.

The reason is that when routers are updated, the L3 agent
request the latest router information from the API server.
If the router has already been deleted, the dictionary
entry for ""gw_port_host"" is already gone. Then the L3 agent
won't be able to delete the snat namespace.

The patch uses the ex_gw_port info in the RouterInfo cache
to get the gw_port_host name instead of ri['gw_port_host'].

The ""Go"" button on the instance log page will be disable after user clicked on it. User needs to refresh the page again to make the button enable.
 
Steps to reproduce.

1. Spin up an instance.
2. Once the instance is up, click the View Log action.
3. On the view log page, enter some valid value on the Log Length text box.
4. Click ""Go"" button.
5. Once the page is refreshed, you will notice that the Go button become disable forever.

The root cause is due to Horizon button will be disabled once user submitted a form.
This behavior works great with regular form submission such as create an instance etc.

However view log page seems to be a single page application. That is, browser does not need to refresh the page to view the log with updated log length. Therefore, we need to mark the ""Go"" button
to be enabled all the time.

This change adds more logging to the extensions and provides return
values which are used in the command_result property on

The agent framework should be more resiliant to errors that can occur.
Most of the errors are temporary and simply need a retry.

This change set adds two pieces:
 - Retries down to the API for list functions.
 - A general retry mechanism to the rpc_loop for all subclassed agents.

Adds a unit test for the retry within the rpc_loop as well.

Crypto middleware needs to arrange for alternative
values of etag and content-type to be sent to container
servers with updates, since these will be encrypted with
a different key than the etag and content-type stored on
the object server.

This patch modifies the object server to overwrite the etag
and content-type values in the container update headers with
values that may optionally be specified by middleware in
X-Backend-Update-Override-* headers.

Using the X-Backend- prefix ensures that these headers
cannot be sent or seen by clients.

A new probe test verifies the propagation of override
values from an internal client through the proxy, to
object server, to container server and then returned
in a container listing.

The volume driver is a new construct that will connect the I/O Server to
a backing Cinder Volume.  This is a bit different from a standard
localdisk that will be provided via Glance.

This change set refactors the Glance disk work into a disk directory.
The cinder volume driver is then defined in a new 'volume' directory.
This will contain the driver volumes, such as NPIV and vSCSI.

The volume driver is built off the LibvirtBaseVolumeDriver model, but
can't extend that directly as that does contain libvirt specific code.
Eventually, we may be able to provide a common volume driver super class
that all drivers can utilize.

https://review.openstack.org/#/c/138215/

_dnsdomain_get was using for update locking, which would not be
permitted for a read transaction. Inspection showed that this locking
was redundant in any case, so this change also removes it, and
refactors the 2 callers (dnsdomain_register_for_project and
dnsdomain_register_for_zone) to avoid the redundant query.

floating_ip_bulk_destroy was creating a session, then not using it
while it iterated over given ip ranges. Instead, it was creating a new
session for both retrieving and deleting floating ips.

Because these updates now happen in a transaction, they must be
committed before calling the reservations api, which expects to be
able to see the changes.

Note that this function still races:

* between querying floating ips and deleting floating ips
* between populating project_id_to_quota_count and updating quota

It needs to be re-architected. This change simply makes the current
behaviour more efficient.

The default ssh connection plugin will cause a task to fail if a

cause a number of builds to fail.

This patch adds a new connection plugin called ssh_retry and sets it as

Do not sync requirements to possibly capped library's master branch

We've hit a situation where a project (pycadf) is listed and capped
in stable/icehouse requirements.txt.  pycadf is also listed in
projects.txt. As part of the requirements integration test, we are
attempting to update pycadf's master branch with stable/icehouse
requirements, and failing because of new dependencies in pycadf that
are not managed by stable/icehouse's GR.

This updates integration.sh so that when we're testing a stable branch,
we are only syncing requirements to other projects have stable branches.
This avoids trying to sync stable requirements into library's master
branches.

In CR next testcases are fixed:
1. tests.storage.test_storage_scenarios.CounterDataTypeTest.
test_storage_can_handle_large_values
Currently we use for assertion 16-decimal number, but in
postgresql double precise type used for counter_volume.
So it supports only 15-decimal accuracy. Test volume should line
with the practical upper bound on storable value in any backend
that the test hits and in this CR used 15-decimal assertion number.

2. tests.storage.test_storage_scenarios.GetEventTest.
test_generated_is_datetime
Issue is in traits order for asserted events. In mysql it's
alphabetical  asc and something else in postgresql.

 Due to the fact that we are using a nova lock utils
 if the compute nodes have a shared file system, then
 the locking is valid for all compute nodes.

 In order to enable an administrator this option,
 we provide a new configuration parameter to enable
 multiple compute nodes to use the same cache folder
 on the back-end data store.

 NOTE: this can only be done when the compute
 nodes are running on the same host or the compute
 nodes have a shared file system.

We've hit a situation where a project (pycadf) is listed and capped
in stable/icehouse requirements.txt.  pycadf is also listed in
projects.txt. As part of the requirements integration test, we are
attempting to update pycadf's master branch with stable/icehouse
requirements, and failing because of new dependencies in pycadf that
are not managed by stable/icehouse's GR.

This updates integration.sh so that when we're testing a stable branch,
we are only syncing requirements to other projects have stable branches.
This avoids trying to sync stable requirements into library's master
branches.

Rally repository includes openstack.common module with modules from
oslo-incubator(modules are listed in openstack-common.conf file).

All those modules can be splitted by 4 categories:
 1. logging modules
 2. aas related modules
 3. cliutils
 4. config

Modules from first category were graduated to separate lib, so we can remove
them and use `oslo.log`.

Modules from second category are not really used and will be not used,
because Rally-as-a-Service will use flask microframework instead of
pecan(modules from oslo-incubator are designed for pecan).

Since oslo core team did not plan to graduate `cliutils` module from
oslo-incubator, so there are no reasons to sync this module with oslo, we
can copy needed functions and maintain them in our repo.

Additional to rally.openstack dir, modules from oslo incubator are located
in tools dir.
tools/config modules works pretty bad, opts from rally.osclients always lost
during automated config generator.
`oslo.config` lib provides a better way to autogenerate config sample of
Rally. It requires new entry point, which returns a list with all opts(look
at 'rally.common.opts', 'setup.cfg' for more details). Since all opts are
used in one place, their names were unified.
Also config was updated(via `tox -egenconfig`).

tools/rally.bash_completion file is moved to etc dir, because etc dir
corresponds better and it gave us ability to remove whole tools dir

We put some warning statements in a while back for
lvs and vgs commands that lasted more than 60 seconds
so we could easily query issues in the gate.

Since then we've made a number of changes to improve our
LVM interactions including the use of an LVM conf file with
a filter for only the VG's Cinder uses.

There's one issue remaining however where during the instance
rescue test in Nova where LVM get's stuck trying to open
devices that no longer exist.  Part of this I think is due
to some manipulation that Nova/KVM does on the attached volume
when the test is run, but also the rescue process in Nova
uses LVM volumes as well and does some moving around and mounting
of devices.

The result is that LVM calls can take quite a while
(greater than 100 seconds) to complete during the rescue process.
This doesn't result in any failures, just that the rescue process
slows things down dramatically and is a pretty heavy process.

Also, the newer versions of process utils include completion
timing in the logs so we don't really need this any longer eve
to query timings and get info.

This patch removes those log statements, and proposes we
document somewhere that rescue operations on a setup that
includes c-vol service and nova-compute service on the same
node will temporarily impact LVM performance.

In Ironic we want to be able to use the IPA ramdisk as the default ramdisk
for our deployments. Since that ramdisk is a heavier than our previous one
we need to bump the memory size from 512MB to 1GB to be able to test it
in gate. It's important to note that since the concurrency job needs 3 VMs
we will still run it using the old ramdisk until we can solve the problem.

Plus, for normal jobs where we bumped the RAM size we are lowering the
number of VMs created from 3 to 1, because only 1 VM get's used anyway.

This patch is making use of the new DEVSTACK_LOCAL_CONFIG that allows
passing arbitrary config options to devstack-gate.

Removes the public_router_id option from tempest.conf, which results in
RouterNotFound failures before the NetworkbasicOps tests can actually commence.
Removing this option allows the tests to proceed.

According to the tempest.conf.sample file, this should only ever be set
when neutron's `allow_overlapping_ips` setting is False. (It is set to
True currently in os-ansible-deployment).

The Nova os-baremetal-nodes endpoint is effectively a proxy for the Ironic
API.  The API schema on the tempest side is too strict, does not reflect
the documented Nova responses and does not reflect the documented Ironic
responses.  Specifically, the node resource properties may be strings or
integers and Nova documents them currently as strings.  This updates the
Tempest schema to accept both.

Current code might delete local handoff objects incorrectly
when remote node requires whole of the objects at poking
because empty cand_objs won't be applied to the delete candidate
objects list.

This patch ensures the delete candidate objects list always
will be updated (i.e. it will be empty list when the poke job
find whole local objects are required by remote), and then,
handle deleting objects correctly according to the delete
candidate.

This patch includes a test written by Clay Gerrard at [1].

Previously a user could place any value the host header of their
http request to Barbican and the result returned would have
the correct URL in the body, but the response location header was
built using the provided (and possibly malicious) host value from
the request header.

Resolved this by ensuring that the location header in the response
field matches the URL returned in the body.

Also added functional tests to ensure that this exposure won't
reappear.

This patch will not allow the 3PAR iSCSI driver to pick another
iSCSI IP from the hp3par_iscsi_ips list during a nova live-migration.

Nova expects that the IQN will be exactly the same as it's attaching
the volume(s) to the new host during live-migration. This conflicts
with the Cinder settings such as ""hp3par_iscsi_ips"" which allows for
multiple IPs for the purpose of load balancing.

Currently, for cold migration, there is a presumption of success unlike
live migration. The instance's host and node fields are updated to the
destination host after the disk and network are migrated to the
destination, but before the images are fetched from glance and applied
(in finish_migration). This makes it impossible to do a fallback to
copy from the source host if the needed image isn't found in glance,
as the source host has already been blown away on the instance, when
migration isn't actually finished yet.

This change moves the assignment of instance host and node to the
finish_migration step, after images have been fetched and applied,
when migration is actually finished.

We have a lot of new angular widgets and panels coming, and some of them
will need access to configs stored in settings. Right now, the default way to
get them is through _conf.html or _script.html. We should really fetch them
through the new REST layer instead. This ensures we are following the same
pattern already set up for angular panels and services.

This version:
- add localstorage for caching config front-end

Once you run './redstack kick-start <datastore>' the image is cached.
If you then pull a more recent copy of the trove-integration repo and
run kick-start again, it will use the cached image.  It will do this
even if the corresponding elements have changed.

This fix checks all the files in the elements directory and prints
out a message if the cached image directory is older than any of
the files that it is built with.  An option to force a rebuild of

This handles the happy and slightly-less-happy paths for EC GET and
HEAD.

In the happy path, enough fragment archives are found to reconstitute
the object. Also, 404s in EC containers work.

Theoretically, EC GET will resume downloads like replicated GET if an
object server fails halfway through. That's not really tested yet,
though. There are tests for some of the lower-level functionality, but
there isn't one that kills an object server partway through.

The approach is basically Clay's approach with the two object
controllers. The proxy server picks the right one based on the
container's storage policy. The vast majority of the old
ObjectController is the same, but the class name changed to
BaseObjectController, and then there's a couple derived classes to
hold EC-specific and replication-specific behavior.

During code development a number of items were re-evaluated so the following
changes were made:

* Instead of a tempauth admin_groups configuration option, we use a
  require_group option. Two reasons:
  1) The .admin group concept is pretty much baked into the existing
     code and tests. A change would be extensive and hard to review.
  2) require_group is closer in concept to keystoneauth's service_roles
     configuration option.

* Originally reseller_admin_role and allow_overrides were proposed to
  allow a prefix. On reflection, it was concluded that it does not make
  sense for these to only apply to specific prefixes.

* Removed the concept of internalURL (in Service Catalog) becaused
  this is not easily configurable in Keystone.

Also corrected or clarified examples by fixing or changing group
names, role names and paths in various places.

This is a functional test that boots a server via the cli, creates a
volume, and tries to attach it via the cli (which causes a failure due
to completion cache code). Note: the failure actually happens *after*
the attach command is dispatched, so the volume attach will still
work, the user is presented an error though.

Many TODOs remain for future patches. The test also tries to document
what was learned about the CLI redirection to cinder API, which was
introduced when Cinder was split out, but was tribal knowledge that
was lost in the mists of time.

This change is a rewrite of the tests, maintaining their original
purpose. The tests no longer touch the database as they mock
allocate_fixed_ip, which is a much cleaner unit boundary with its own

Any resources which work with headers - mostly Container and Object in
object_store - are not currently working properly due to the case
sensitive nature of the attributes being in a traditional dictionary.
Any header props *set* on those resources which are then sent to the
server are ok, which is why we've been able to set and then receive our
own values,  but any that are received would have to be in the matching
case that the prop is setup as. This is not generally the case, as
setting metadata on containers or objects in Horizon or other control
panels uses capitalization, which ends up not matching up properly when
we convert the server values into a resource.

This change implements a CaseInsensitiveDict which keeps the original
user-set values around and then keeps a dictionary mapping a lowercased
version of the key to the user-set key. It implements the typical
MutableMapping operations.

basic/detail requests were done, and exposes it through the proxy with

Currently we have a somewhat bogus internal equivalence between the
""json"" parameter type and the MAP property type.  This is a problem
when exposing json parameters via provider resources, because the
schema of the exposed property does not exactly match the capabilities
of the underlying parameter.

Specifically, json parameters can take strings (json serialized list or
map), and also lists and maps directly.  Currently, we can only pass
maps, which means some data, for example a list of maps (which is possible
when interacting directly with a json parameter) is not possible when
using the same parameter abstracted via a TemplateResource.

To work around this add a flag which relaxes the type rules and enables
some coercion of map values, only when they're going via a schema derived
from a json parameter.

This change set provides some refactorings that make the code easier to
read and maintain.  The key changes are:
 - Support fixtures in a similar way that nova_powervm does.  This
   reduces the amount of mock up code required for testing.
 - Rename the powervm_sea_agent to sea_agent.  The PowerVM is already
   part of the namespace (due to the folder it is in).  This was
   creating too long of a name for use.
 - Change the connection utility to be PVMUtils.  Simpler name more in
   line with how the function has evolved.
 - Incorporated some code comments from an earlier change set that was
   early merged.

Having DATABASE_QUERY_LOGGING enabled results in devstack turning
on verbose mysql query logging. This results in a log file
/var/log/mariadb/mariadb-slow.log that grows to 10's of GB in
size in very little time (few weeks if that). Developers never
seem to notice this exists until their host OS runs out of disk
space due to this logfile that is never truncated.

Very few people will ever look at this logged data, so a more
sensible default is False, to make the out of the box setup be

Instead of doing inline setup of the API service in integrated_helpers
extract this functionality to a fixture so that it can easily be
reused in other functional tests.

The setup work to patch the global CONF to be able to run the API
server is also extracted into a fixture, and the inline setup in
integrated_helpers is removed.

fake_network=True is already set in the global conf_fixture used by
nova.test, setting it again here is redundant (also, aren't deep
inheritance stacks in tests fun‽)

The _get_flags support is still required because ~ 13 tests manipulate
the extension lists with it (though they make no other changes). We
should semantically extract that concept so that a test can declare an
extension list more abstractly, and we get that to the OSAPI fixture.

For some reason -n doesn't work with arrays, probably becuase
the array has an entry by the array's indexed value is empty.

By quoting it we get it as one unit, which behaves as expected.

ML2 agents tend to support a rebuild of the bridges upon a restart of
the agent.  This change set provides a baseline for the agent such that
it rebuilds properly upon boot up.  The clean up should:
 - Ensure that each Neutron Port is served via the Network Bridge
 - Remove any non-required VLANs off the bridges
 - Only removes VLANs that aren't in use, whether it is managed by
   Neutron or externally.

The clean method also runs periodically during query.  It does this as
it is a moderately expensive method call.  Future change sets will
optimize this flow.

toposort implements a topological sort in Python. The above change

The library is fairly simple. I would expect it to be updated rarely.

It is python 3 compatible.

It is not packaged for either Ubuntu or Fedora as of February 2015.

Its function is not covered by any other currently required library

A feasible, but undesirable, alternative to using this package would
be to implement a topological sort function in OpenStack.

The cache completion was causing a bug where 'nova volume-attach' would
then try to query Nova for volume information using a URL that was not
valid.  This caused it to appear that the attach had failed.

Additionally the idea of making extra API queries for a bash completion
cache should be thought throught more.

For some of the apis like add_route, delete_route, add_gateway., etc
passing the ip_version is optional as iproute2 library internally derives
this information based on the arguments like CIDR/ip_address etc.
However, for apis like get_gateway, list_onlink_routes and delete_gateway
we will have to include the ip_version to get the required info. Currently
these api's only return IPv4 routes. This patch includes the necessary
changes to retrieve IPv4/IPv6 routes and is required for IPv6 use-cases.

Because of the new gating system (gate-training-guides-tox-slides), we need to
cleanup all existing RST files.

There is a small rendering problem with Landslide in the Upstream training
and all the Title slides (empty slides with only a Title). The check doesn't
like ""empty"" slides (""Document or section may not begin with a transition.""),
Landslide deals with this by ignoring errors
(https://github.com/adamzap/landslide/issues/94), but our gating check does
not. I temporary changed all such slides to normal ones.

I also had to change training-guides/landslide.sh a bit (a quick hack so that
it works as expected).

* RootHelperProcess and AsyncProcess have duplicate functions so we merge
all functions of RootHelperProcess in functional test to AsyncProcess
in common lib.
* Add optional param 'wait_cmd_start' for AsyncProcess to wait for the
command of the child process to start executing before it can return to
main process. This solves concurrent call in the main process, which
depends on the start of the child process. Defaults to False.
* Add optional param 'read_std_to_queue' to enable/disable reading result
into a queue. Defaults to True.

of RootHelperProcess.

This reverts commit 4c8cefb98a425382204df2f38f24e6b5b71520dd.

The cache completion was causing a bug where 'nova volume-attach' would
then try to query Nova for volume information using a URL that was not
valid.  This caused it to appear that the attach had failed.

Additionally the idea of making extra API queries for a bash completion
cache should be thought through more.

make use of scripts which are located in the repository which is
cloned. This is done to improve flexibility - if the check needs to
change, it can be done within the script instead of submitting a review
to the project-config.

This commit also implements the commit check as a voting check across
all branches, and also changes the merge check from the lint check to
the commit check.
