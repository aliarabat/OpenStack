Some projects (like neutron) provide their own docs job, so we should
use it instead of running build_sphinx directly.

The use case to maintain a custom docs job is f.e. to enable sphinx
warnings in gate. They were enabled before for neutron under assumption
that gate relies on the job, but it's not the case, as it turned out.

Note that projects that want to expose the tox job to gate should have
it defined in tox envlist so that 'tox -l' returns it.

The certificate fetch function code was complicated because you
passed in a string to pick the certificate type. This was a
holdover from before keystoneclient was used because it was
building the paths to the certificates. Now auth_token is just

We currently use both ci_testing and ci_testing_zuul to define
whether we are being run from CI. However, ci_testing_zuul
required a hostname match to be defined, and ci_testing
depended on the ZUUL_CHANGES environment variable, set in
OpenStack CI. This was a little confusing.

This change splits up the boolean values which control
CI-related tasks in the following way:

ci_testing - Used for general-purpose CI tasks that are not
tied to the OpenStack CI infrastructure
ci_testing_zuul - Used for CI tasks that are specific to
the OpenStack CI infrastructure
ci_testing_zuul_changes - Used for CI tasks when
ZUUL_CHANGES is set.

Also, move away from the old hostname-based check to confirm
whether we are running under OpenStack CI as this could prove
to be fragile. Instead, look for the ZUUL_BRANCH environment
variable.

map a high level application into HTTP, and some of the constraints in
doing so. The purpose is to provide a common background around what

RESTful APIs so that we can be on a common ground when debating

Beaker(puppet testing tool) has plugable hypervisor backends. Create one
project to manage the 'ssh to localhost' backend and one to hit the
nodepool api (rest or gear) remotely.

The aviator builders are here because they are actually just good solid
ruby tests. If this works out we can look at refactoring some generic
ruby test builders.

The beaker-localhost hypervisor backend can be used instead of the None
we are using now. This is more hygenic because we can specify exactly
how to behave instead of counting on fallback behaviour that may change.
There are some things this wont fix such as using ssh at all and
managing sshd_config. I've been talking about writing our own hypervisor
for several weeks now so I'd like to at least get it stubbed out as a
potential extention point.

The beaker-nodepool hypervisor might better live in stackforge/. It is a
hypervisor for beaker that interacts with the nodepool service to
provision nodes. I will likely use this with a standalone nodepool (no
zuul) for another project. It makes sense to keep this close to the
nodepool community(infra) but that isn't a technical requirement.

they were still usable.

Python 2.7.9+ and 3.2.6+ limits the number of maximum headers in httplib to 100
[1,2,3]. This setting is too low for Swift.

By default the maximum number of allowed headers depends on the number of max
allowed metadata settings plus a default value of 32 for regular http headers.
If for some reason this is not enough (custom middleware for example) it can be
increased with the extra_header_count constraint.

After a utils.spawn_n call we lose the context for logging because it's
not in the local thread store.  This was causing log lines to miss
context.  Additionally a call to context.get_admin_context() would add
that context to the local store making it appear that the context had
changed during a request.

This wraps methods being called with spawn_n so that they add the
context to the local store immediately.

TestEncryptedCinderVolumes passes for the ceph job today but it's a
false positive since the rbd volume driver in cinder does not return the
'encrypted' key in it's connection_info dict from the
os-initialize_connection API to Nova, and Nova keys off 'encrypted' in
connection_info to see if it should run the volume encryption provider
when attaching the volume (in the case of the libvirt driver in Nova).

Cinder change I03f8cae05cc117e14f7482115de685fc9f3fa54a sets the
'encrypted' key in connection_info for rbd volumes which then makes Nova
attempt volume encryption but that fails for the rbd volume type since
it's not currently supported in Nova. Eventually the tests fail in
Tempest because the volume status does not go to 'in-use' since the
attach failed.

This change adds a config option so that the encrypted cinder volume
tests can be skipped in the ceph job until rbd volume encryption is
supported in Nova.

An alternative to a new config option would be to check if the
CONF.volume.storage_protocol is 'ceph' and raise a skip exception for
bug 1463525, but given the number of other cinder volume drivers that
might have this same issue I figured it was best to make Tempest
configurable rather than hard-code all of the invalid storage protocols
in the test.

Added a special datastructures (CoercedList, CoercedDict and CoercedSet)

The instances of these structures are returned when the values of

subsequent calls which are going to add new elements to the fields'
colelctions will be processed by the overridden methods of new
datastructures, thus the new elements will be coerced and the exceptions
risen if the coercing is not possible.

This also fixes a bug in TestObjMakeList which was specifying incorrect

It was not leading to failures as the items of this collection were not

This change allow the moving of swift components off of the
controllers. This change adds four new heira values that can be used
to install swift on nodes other than the controllers. The values are:

*) swift_master_role - The role used to designate the primary swift
                       node. Defaults to 'primary-controller'.
*) swift_nodes - The list of swift nodes that will be configured.
                 Defaults to using the controller(s) from heira
*) primary_swift - A boolean used to indicate if this is the primary
                   swift node. This is used to determine how to
                   distrubute the ring files. By default, this uses
                   the 'primary_controller' setting from hiera.
*) swift_proxies - A list of swift nodes that swift proxy is running
                   on.  By default, the controllers are used.

This commit contains 2 unrelated fixes, updates the sample config to
reflect changes in a recent oslo.log release and remove direct calls
to fixtures cleanUp(). Normally we don't want to do this and should
have only 1 fix per patch. However, because they are both breaking the
tempest gate at the same time and preventing anything from landing if
we don't land them in a single patch neither fix will be able to land.

The fixtures 1.3.0 release started enforcing that manually calling the
cleanUp() function for a fixture that was created using useFixture()
was a bad idea. It's basically saying we don't want to manage the
fixture lifecycle but at the same time want to manually run cleanUp().
This enforcement included in the new release has been causing several
unit test failures when running with that release. This commit
addresses this by removing all the uses of this call straightup as it
turns out it was unecessary, or changing the tests to not rely on it
anymore.

This reverts commit 1d61c5f736b9df7253a1939fe55f1875f988d1f4,
which reverted ee51ef72d37a02005a7733b7f2faf7236db850a1 due
to an issue with the allocation pools being mis-aligned with
the last address of a v6 subnet.

IPv6 does not have a subnet broadcast address so the last IP
address can be used as a regular address. This patch tweaks the
automatic allocation pool generation to include that last address
on v6 networks.

This was found because
NetworksTestDHCPv6.test_dhcp_stateful_fixedips_outrange makes the
assumption that the default generated pools cover the entire usable
address space.

This reverts commit 9a6536de6e1a7fe9b2552adc142e254426b82b6f.

We pulled all of the plugins out of the tree, many of which still inherit
from neutron test classes. This change then stated that we no longer
support testing other plugins. I think this is a bit premature and should
have been discussed under the subject 
""Neutron plugins can't use neutron plugin unit tests"" or something
similar.

Normally, a Fixture which raises an exception on setUp() doesn't call
cleanUp(). In case the framework raises an exception during the setUp of
such a fixture (specifically, the EnvironmentFixture, responsible for
creating all the processes and resources), it won't cleaned.

A specific function that can raise an exception like this is if one of
the processes failed to start. In this case, an eventlet.timeout.Timeout
exception is raised and the cleanUp is never called. This patch adds a
try-except block around the timeout-invoking function and makes sure to
cleanUp() the resources before re-raising the error.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

This change addresses the bug where inaccurate line numbers / ranges
are displayed when an issue is detected in a multiline statement.

There's been a Python issue open since 2012 about this:
http://bugs.python.org/issue16806

Two main parts to the commit:
 - Modify StatementBuffer so get_next() will allow lookahead without
   popping the item off the buffer.
 - Add cleverness to visit() so if it does come across a multiline
   statement, it updates the context linerange based on information
   pulled out of the StatementBuffer.

Also of note, the commit includes several new tests for fix
verification. Seemingly non-deterministic test results were driving
me batty until the need to move the BanditResultStore 'resstore =
OrderedDict()' call from class-level to object instantion became
obvious.

Installing Python to a ramdisk takes quite a long time because of
the way dracut checks for dependencies of every single file
installed.  We could avoid that, but then we might miss a required
library file.

This change alters the installation method to speed up
the process.  First, it creates a list of files that are needed and
then installs them all at once using inst_multiple instead of calling
inst on each file separately.  This doesn't make a huge difference,
but in my testing it is marginally faster.

Second, and more significantly, we don't need the *.pyo and *.pyc
files as those are simply an optimization to speed up module
loading.  Because the deploy ramdisk is a short-lived operation,
we probably lose more time transferring those extra files to the
target system than we save in improved load times.

In my testing, these two changes netted about a 20% improvement
in build times, and about 13% decrease in image size.

Neutron has a lot of concepts that some users don't want or need to
understand, but must be configured if 'nova boot' is to succeed in
a Neutron-based deployment. For this reason, the bar has been set
a little too high for those users migrating from a Nova-network based
deployment (where network are pre-defined by the admin), to a Neutron-
based one, where users get to define their own networks.

Documenting how administrators can ease this transition is required,
this spec is a step at addressing this, and outlines the options and
some possible future enhancements for Neutron.

This reverts commit e5f6ed69e0031900f97da185b5363ebd3dd60c0c.

This was an attempted workaround for the notifier issue.
It's not needed now that the fake notifier has been fixed,
so restore the default behavior.

Also remove conf imports which were added in commit d9b9ac
to fix commit e5f6ed.

If we change configuration files right after installing service
packages, automatically started services may pick up changed
configuration files rather than the default files they were packaged
with.

If the neutron-l3-agent starts with our custom configuration file which
refers to the external bridge br-ex while that bridge is not there
(yet), the port is permanently marked as unavailable (vlan tag=4095).

In such a case, a line like this can be found in /etc/openvswitch/conf.db:
{""_date"":1435514607570,
""Port"":{""20b0e96c-6103-46e6-a234-a4d5439eece7"":{""tag"":4095}}, ""_comment"":""
ovs-vsctl: /usr/bin/ovs-vsctl --timeout=10 set Port qr-4be1ab91-60 tag=4095""
,""Open_vSwitch"":{""e00f3d6f-e55a-419a-a605-141021026dee"":{""next_cfg"":15}}}

For additional information, check this neutron bug:
Neutron openvswitch-agent doesn't recover ports from binding_failed status
https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1399249

This is another race -- waiting for a few seconds before changing the
configuration files fixes the problem. The alternative used in this
patch is to stop the neutron-l3-agent before editing the configuration
files and to start it only once the bridge is ready.

When using 'preserve ephemeral', we save the disk layout information
so that if a rebuild is requested, we can check that the disk layout
hasn't been changed by the user.

This information (ephemeral_gb, swap_mb, and root_gb) was being
saved in the node's driver_internal_info['instance'] by
iscsi_deploy.parse_instance_info(), which may be called several
times and by e.g. validate(). However, the information should only
be saved when a node is being deployed to, and not before.

Now the information is only saved when a node is being deployed to.

code that was introduced in commit

This patch changes the generic volume migration logic to support
non-attachable volumes.  Previously in generic volume migration, each
volume was attached locally and dd was executed on the block device
paths to move volume contents from source to target.  This patch adds an
'is_attachable' method that volume drivers can use to express whether or
not they support local attachment.  If one or both of the volumes
involved in a migration operation cannot be attached locally, the
manager will now attempt to open a file handle for both volumes and move
data from source to target using file I/O.  This allows drivers like RBD
to participate in volume migration using file I/O when it would
otherwise be impossible as attachment is not supported.

Because an instance of both source and target volumes is necessary to
open the needed file handles, the migration logic is moved from the
volume driver into the manager.  A previous approach attempted to leave
the logic in the volume driver, but instantiating a new driver at that
layer became too messy.

Support for RBD is included as a reference for other drivers that wish
to take advantage of this alternative approach.

Using file I/O will bypass our I/O throttling code as it uses cgroups to
limit block device traffic.  A solution for this will come in a future
patch.

This change is part of a set that adds neutron support to existing

methods.

is assigned to an instance without worrying about the specific service,

Open ended queries are usually not a good practice since it is not possible to
predict the amount of data that is returned to the client. This generates issues
like client time-out or data flood.

The proposal is to always have a limit for queries that do not significantly
restrict the scope of the response and provide a link to retrieve the other
chunk (or rest) of the available data.

Tests for scheduler.rpcapi are very weak. Even changing keyword
arguments names passed to call and cast methods in this module
doesn't trigger unit tests failures. This commit adds keyword
arguments validation to prevent problems similar to ones caused
by bug 1467841 in backup.rpcapi. I've also fixed argument order
in assertEqual usages there.

The Heat contraints group was missing the initial
dependency on Keystone, causing Pacemaker to Heat before or
in parallel to Keystone.

Given Systemd can define dependencies in the unit files, this was
additionally causing an unmanaged start of Keystone making
cluster initialization to fail (with Keystone start timeout blocking
all the depending resources).

Also moves Keystone -> Ceilomter constraint on top of Ceilometer
constraints group for clarity.

Make sure that multiple consoleauth processes can run in the
same environment without external memcache. The main problem
with that setup was about tokens not being available to other
services at the same time. (they were cached only in one daemon)
As a side-effect the change also allows restarting consoleauth
processes without losing tokens permanently.

External interfaces and behaviours do not change. Tokens will be
written to the database as well as the usual cache. If the cache
does not hold the token, the database will be checked.

All database operations happen via the conductor interface.

Depending on the number of requests for tokens in the environment
it may be necessary to cleanup the console_auth_tokens table from
time to time.

A pradict task could be added to do console_auth_tokerns table clean
up works.

in OSC we accept rules as a list, without wrapping it into top level

If instance is in soft_deleted state then subsequent calls to delete
api with instance name fails whereas the same succeeds if called
using instance id. This same issue also exists if user attempts to
delete server with instance name using force-delete command.

The main reason why delete and force-delete commands fails with instance
name is because internally it calls list method which doesn't fetch
instances that are in soft_deleted state and it returns error message
""No server with a name or ID of '<instance name>' exists.

Added 'soft_deleted' option in '_get_server_search_options' method
to allow '_get_servers' method to return instances whose vm_state
is 'SOFT_DELETED'.

This change makes it possible for OSAD to instruct yaprt to NEVER
do anything with tempest and the requirements that are being
brought with the requirements that can cause issues with un-versioned
requirements. This flag simply instructs yaprt to index the repo
as a item in the report but in this case absolutely no requirements
will be indexed or built for tempest.

This was done because tempest does not version anything and its
forward movement makes it impossible to maintain a consistent stack
and for our purposes, we install tempest in a venv using an isolated
install so none of these tempest requirements are necessary for us
to have to deal with.

We shouldn't be able to bump global requirement versions if that
would be incompatible with the current test set of versions. To assess
'works' we need to run them in tests which means that we need to
update upper-constraints.txt at the same time. We don't test all
versions however, so just checking that the constraints version is
compatible with the updated global requirements is sufficient.

This adds a dependency on the pypa packaging library. The library is
maintained by the authors of setuptools and pip, is Apache V2, in good
condition and Python 3 ready. Its a test-only dependency so I don't
think the distro packaging status matters. This is *the* reference
library for packaging facilities on Python.

If we've got two identical patterns one of them needs to fall
through or have them both in the same block.

It appears there was some merge confusion with

5f8b3cb631688ec65629fffaf0f8b7615a16c511

This tries to get the correct the original intent: flat out disable
for ceilometer and disable depending on branch for keystone.

This patch adds VersionedObjects abstraction layer to volume backups.
The object derives from CinderObjectDictCompat, so it supports both
object (obj.prop) and dict (obj['prop']) syntax to access properties.
Complete move to object notation will be made in a follow up clean up
patch.

Add a volume driver which can use Virtuozzo Storage, which
has filesystem interface and so volume driver has a similar
workflow to NFS and SMBFS drivers.

At this point the driver contain minimal set of features. Because
I think some refactoring should be done in RemoteFS drivers before
further development. For example code, which deals with image formats
should go to the RemoteFS class. So I don't add qcow2 images support

When the full threshold of a pool is exceeded, VNX does not allow
more LUNs to be created in the pool unless -ignoreThresholds is
specified explicitly. The following logic is added to address
the issue.

If reserved_percentage is configured in cinder.conf,
get_volume_stats will simply report the specified value.

Otherwise, the driver will check a new boolean option
ignore_pool_full_threshold.
* If the option is set to False, the pool full threshold will be
considered when calculating reserved_percentage.
* If the option is set to True, original logic is used for
reserved_percentage.

If ignore_pool_full_threshold is True -ignoreThresholds will
be added to force the LUN creation.

partial revert of Iffd6001c337fa692cc3925778eeb98dda46b2c78.
we are not able to revert the patch to support those chasing trunk.
this patch makes original migration a noop for future cases and
adds a follow up script to revert migration if already applied.

it does not revert ids that are under the domain of ceilometer and
are known to be within 128 char length, specifically:

- message_id
- message_signature
- event_id (alarm)
- alarm_id

Rather than using the Python provided logging module that reimplents the
whole syslog protocol and pointing it to /dev/log (which is not
portable), we use the system calls from the syslog module, which are
portable and default to the behaviour we actually want.
