There are two important reasons for this change:
 - Other OpenStack components contain this code already.
 - Heat store references on client/constraint/version plugins in
   setup.cfg and and stevedore uses these references, so we should
   install Heat after changing this part of code. As example look patch
   https://review.openstack.org/#/c/86978/ for grenade job, where
   heat-engine can not find two constrainsts due to changing their code
   place between releases.

Adding version 1.3.7
1.3.x angular is needed for Horizon launch instance work.

This was dependent on the following (done):
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/142520/

Xstatic-Angular 1.3.7 includes the following packages:

XStatic-Angular-Cookies
XStatic-Angular-Mock

They can be removed, but this apparently needs to be done
in a multi-step process. The interdependency chain,
(horizon has dependency on the old packages) causes
an integration test to fail. So, if we follow the normal
process, then we have to do it in the following order.

1) The newer pakage has to be added to global requirements
2) a) The new dependency has to be added to Horizon
   b) Old dependencies must be removed from Horizon
3) The older packages must be removed from global requirements
   - change 145096

At least this what I can tell how to make it all
work following processes since I can't modify the
requirements across projects in the same patch set.

The previous version of these tests fetch data directly from the data service
and from congress and compares the two responses.  However, the test is not
synchronized with whatever inserts data into the data service, so when the
test starts, the data service might not have all the data.  While the test is
running, the data service can get more data and give the data to congress.
This causes the test to think congress has data that the data service does
not, leading to a KeyError.

This changes makes the test fetch data from the data service and congress each
time the test tries to compare the two.  This ensures that eventually, the two
datasets converge.  It also avoids the KeyError when the congress data has
something the data service does not.

This patch migrates the keystone_tenant provider to use the universal
openstack client instead of the keystone client. It uses the openstack
parent provider in openstacklib to handle multiple authenticating
methods. The keystone_tenant type uses the openstacklib openstack
utility to add a new auth parameter to the keystone_tenant type.

This patch also moves functionality for parsing keystone.conf for the
service token back to the keystone module from openstacklib. It creates
three tiers of inheritance: Keystone_tenant < Keystone < Openstack, so
that keystone-specific functionality can stay in keystone.

It also adds a flush method which should help improve performance.

The os-floating-ips extension translates the floating IP information
from the network API for the response but is only checking fields based
on what comes back from nova-network, which is using the FloatingIP
object. The neutronv2 API returns a different set of keys for the
instance/instance_uuid which the API extension doesn't handle and
therefore doesn't show the associated instance id for a given floating
IP.

The network APIs should return consistent data formats so this change
adds the expected key to fix the bug in the API extension (since the API
extensions shouldn't have to know the implementation details of the
network API, there are some extensions actually checking if it's the
neutron API and parsing the result set based on that).

This change will be used to backport the fix to the stable branches.

The longer term fix is to convert the neutronv2 get_floating_ip* API
methods to use nova objects which will be done as part of blueprint
kilo-objects in a separate change.

Conflicts:
        nova/tests/unit/network/test_neutronv2.py

NOTE(mriedem): The conflict is due to the test modules being
moved in Kilo, otherwise the code is the same.

While rebuilding IPAllocationPools, Neutron is using netaddr.iter_iprange
(a generator that produces IPAddress objects). For an IPv6 subnet, this is
a costly operation and is causing Neutron Server to hang. This patch
addresses the issue by replacing netaddr.iter_iprange with netaddr.IPRange

Metadata filtering logic in it's current form is tightly coupled with
compute code. To make this filtering logic usable for filtering
metadata of other resources, it is being moved to utils.py file. The
filtering metadata logic is going to be used for filtering volume and
volume snapshot metadata in the EC2 API, at the very least.

There were no unit tests present at all to test the filtering logic.
Those have been added too, and in the process of writing unit tests,
a bug was found: a single character value of a resource metadata
(e.g. 'c') matches when a filter is specified which contains
that character as a part of input matching string (e.g.
all resources which has a metadata value = 'taco')

The bug has also been fixed, and accompanying testcase added

Having an instance and an attached volume on the same physical host
(i.e. data locality) can be desirable in some configurations, in order
to achieve high-performance disk I/O.

This patch adds an InstanceLocalityFilter filter that allow users to
request creation of volumes 'local' to an existing instance, without
specifying the hypervisor's hostname, and without any knowledge of the
underlying back-ends.

In order to work:
- At least one physical host should run both nova-compute and
  cinder-volume services.
- The Extended Server Attributes extension needs to be active in Nova
  (this is by default), so that the 'OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host' property is
  returned when requesting instance info.
- The user making the call needs to have sufficient rights for the
  property to be returned by Nova. This can be achieved either by
  changing Nova's policy.json (the 'extended_server_attributes' option),
  or by setting an account with privileged rights in Cinder conf.

For example:
  Instance 01234567-89ab-cdef is running in a hypervisor on the physical
  host 'my-host'.

  To create a 42 GB volume in a back-end hosted by 'my-host':
    cinder create --hint local_to_instance=01234567-89ab-cdef 42

Note:
  Currently it is not recommended to allow instance migrations for
  hypervisors where this hint will be used. In case of instance
  migration, a previously locally-created volume will not be
  automatically migrated. Also in case of instance migration during the
  volume's scheduling, the result is unpredictable.

This is my alternative proposal which, I admit, is a pretty dramatic
departure from our current charter and organization. In summary, I've
changed the role of the TC from Judge to Advisor, removed the notion of
Programs entirely, and defined OpenStack Projects as source code that is
recognized as enhancing the experience of OpenStack users that lives in
the openstack/ code namespace.

A follow-up patch will define some of the tags that will be used to
convey useful information about a project's purpose, integration,
release cadence, named liaisons, operational status, etc.

A related patch moves some of the content of the programs.yaml file to
the project-config repository:

Currently neutron-ns-metadata-proxy runs with root permissions when
namespaces are enabled on the l3 agent because root permissions are
required to ""enter"" in the namespace. But neutron-ns-metadata-proxy
permissions should be reduced as much as possible because it is
reachable from vms.

This change allows to change neutron-ns-metadata-proxy permissions
after its startup through the 2 new options metadata_proxy_user and
metadata_proxy_group which allow to define user/group running metadata
proxy after its initialization. Their default values are
neutron-l3-agent effective user and group.

Permissions drop is done after metadata proxy daemon writes its
pid in its pidfile (it could be disallowed after permissions drop).

Using nobody as metadata_proxy_user/group (more secure) is currently
not supported because:

* nobody has not the permission to connect the metadata socket,
* nobody has not the permission to log to file because neutron uses
  WatchedFileHandler (which requires read/write permissions after
  permissions drop).
This limitation will be addressed in a daughter change.

Add a tool (derived from taskflow's similar tool)
that can turn the state machine defined in ironic
into a dot diagram.

This diagram is much easier to look at then trying
to mentally create a similar diagram; this makes it
easier to see issues and to visualize the state machines
valid states and transitions.

For this change we need to add back in the state machine
__iter__ method so that we can correctly iterate over the
states and transitions (and events that will cause those
transitions).

Imagine a 3-zone ring, and consider a partition in that ring with
replicas placed as follows:

* replica 0 is on device A (zone 2)
* replica 1 is on device B (zone 1)
* replica 2 is on device C (zone 2)

Further, imagine that there are zero parts_wanted in all of zone 3;
that is, zone 3 is completely full. However, zones 1 and 2 each have
at least one parts_wanted on at least one device.

When the ring builder goes to gather replicas to move, it gathers
replica 0 because there are three zones available, but the replicas
are only in two of them. Then, it places replica 0 in zone 1 or 2
somewhere because those are the only zones with parts_wanted. Notice
that this does *not* do anything to spread the partition out better.

Then, on the next rebalance, replica 0 gets picked up and moved
(again) but doesn't improve its placement (again).

If your builder has min_part_hours > 0 (and it should), then replicas
1 and 2 cannot move at all. A coworker observed the bug because a
customer had such a partition, and its replica 2 was on a zero-weight
device. He thought it odd that a zero-weight device should still have
one partition on it despite the ring having been rebalanced dozens of
times.

Even if you don't have zero-weight devices, having a bunch of
partitions trade places on each rebalance isn't particularly good.

Note that this only happens with an unbalanceable ring; if the ring
*can* balance, the gathered partitions will swap places, but they will
get spread across more zones, so they won't get gathered up again on
the next rebalance.

Enables optionally disabling strict validation, which atm just
disables the value part of properties validation.

This is needed for a similar reason to bug #1347571, which
conditionally disables value validation when inter-resource
references cause a default pre-create value to be evaluated by
a custom constraint (e.g the default resource name returned by
get_resource until a resource is actually created).

This flag enables a similar fix for StackResource, so we avoid
strictly validating before create, otherwise the nested stack
validation fails when the default resource name is passed in
during validation, even though create-time validation would succeed.

The bug (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+bug/1337761) reports that 
""publish_sample"" is a main cause of performance degradation as a result of
 re-measurement without the ""self.publish_sample()"" execution.
The publish_sample publishes samples to pipeline. The sample is sequential
ly published. A GET/PUT request is published twice and a DELETE request is
 published once. The performance is degraded with the behavior above. 
Therefore, publish samples on asynchronous from main thread. The performan
ce is improved by reducing the publishing cost.

Changes as follows:
 * Create a Greenthread pool.
 * Publish samples on other threads.
 * Manage samples by Queue.
 * Retry when it failed to publish.
 * Add two parameters (publisher_workers, and publisher_expire) to config.

This patch introduces the concept of a 'retargetable' functional api
test.  Such a test targets an abstract client class, and by varying
the implementation of the client, the test can target multiple
backends.

The test added by this patch (test_network_lifecycle) can be run
against the programmatic plugin api (for configured plugins) via both
tox -e functional and tox -e dsvm-functional.  The latter env is used
by the gating neutron-dsvm-functional job.

The test can also be run against a live Neutron service via 'tox -e api'
which will soon be run as part of the check queue by the
neutron-dsvm-api job [1].  Running this tox env requires
devstack-deployed Neutron and Tempest.

The intention is to refactor the existing plugin tests
(e.g. NeutronDbPluginV2TestCase) to use this model.  Functional tests
don't have to isolate functionality - they just need to exercise it -
so fewer tests will be required.  The new tests will be able to target
plugins directly rather than through the wsgi stack, so execution time
will be decreased.  The refactored tests should be easier to maintain
and take less time to run.

Perhaps best of all, since the same tests will be able to target a
deployed service in the neutron-dsvm-api job, the deployed behaviour
of api changes will finally be able to gate merges to the Neutron
tree.

Notable parts of the change:

- tests/api
  - base_v2 -      defines the client interface (BaseNeutronClient)
                   and the base class (BaseTestApi) for the
                   retargetable test (test_network_lifecycle)

  - test_v2_rest - implements the client interface for the tempest
                   rest client and configures the retargetable test
                   with scenarios for json serialization

- tests/functional/api
  - test_v2_plugin - implements the client interface for the
                     programmatic plugin api and configures the
                     retargetable test with scenarios targeting the
                     linuxbridge and openvswitch plugins

- tests/unit
  - refactor bits of the existing plugin tests for reuse

New version of oslo.i18n released and some things
moved around (internal private modules in the lib).

This should be fine and shouldn't matter to us, BUT
it seems we had some hackery going on in our unit tests
that were being lazy and importing and manipulating the
private library.

This patch removes those cases and fixed up the cinder.i18n
helper method for enable_lazy to accept a bool (which is how
the libraries method works to begin with).

There were several tests in test_faults that were actually
performing and comparing translations of messages.  These
tests aren't quite working now because they had a number
of things they imported from private variables and methods
in the i18n module.  Honestly I'm not sure of the value of
testing those things here anyway, but for now I've just
added a skip to those and we can sort out long term fixes
and plans later.

This avoids storing direct copies of incoming objects and
makes sure that we always merge incoming objects (if a
saved object already exists) or create a copy of the
incoming object if it does not exist when storing.

On retrieval we also always return copies instead of
returning the data that is stored internally to avoid the
problems that can be hard to detect when users (engine
or other) modify those source objects.

This patch performs multiple refactorings of conductor/manager.py:
- move a few class methods closer to where they are invoked,
  to improve readability
- move and rename async helper methods out of the ConductorManager class:
    _do_node_deploy, _do_node_teardown,
    _provisioning_error_handler, _power_state_error_handler,
    _do_sync_power_state
- do_node_deploy now sets conductor affinity after error checking,
  though this should have no functional impact
- Moving _do_sync_power_state out of the main class required
  returning the count instead of updating the counter directly.
- Consolidated a LOG.warning and LOG.error message within
  _do_sync_power_state into a single LOG.error. Both were being logged
  within the same exception block.
- Refactored _do_sync_power_state to improve readability, and in the
  process of this refactoring, a bug in the unit tests was found:
  fail_change=True was not properly tested.
- Corrects issue with max_retries running an extra attempt.

A future patch should move these methods into conductor/utils.py.

The os-floating-ips extension translates the floating IP information
from the network API for the response but is only checking fields based
on what comes back from nova-network, which is using the FloatingIP
object. The neutronv2 API returns a different set of keys for the
instance/instance_uuid which the API extension doesn't handle and
therefore doesn't show the associated instance id for a given floating
IP.

The network APIs should return consistent data formats so this change
adds the expected key to fix the bug in the API extension (since the API
extensions shouldn't have to know the implementation details of the
network API, there are some extensions actually checking if it's the
neutron API and parsing the result set based on that).

This change will be used to backport the fix to the stable branches.

The longer term fix is to convert the neutronv2 get_floating_ip* API
methods to use nova objects which will be done as part of blueprint
kilo-objects in a separate change.

Relying on [1], property Dimensions isn't required, but
this template has no Default value for Dimensions
(thereby making it required). This patch fixes that omission.
Besides that, parameters have wrong parsing, because if
parameter with type 'CommaDelimitedList' has default
value '', parameter's parsing result would be [u''] instead
of []. this is wrong, so this patch fixes it.

requests provides a method, where(), which returns the location
of the CA bundle. One is provided with the package but it
recommends that distros override this. Both Fedora and Ubuntu
do this, and provide a means of installing additional CAs into
the bundle. This allows devstack to add its own self-signed CA
to the global bundle. Not having this causes subtle failures.

Cleaning up log messages and thought it
would be useful to make it ""easier"" to log the
volume/snapshot/backup/image id's more easily.

Unlike the Nova Instance work that was submitted this
key will work with any db ref object that has a ""name""
member.  Most OpenStack objects have an internal name
that is built using the UUID of the resource object.
Resource objects in Cinder for example use:
  ""<resourceName-uuid>""

For those that don't have the name member, we also
give the ability to set resource as a dict, with
keys 'type' and 'id' that will form the same string.

With this change, LOG calls in projects can be sent like:
  LOG.info(_LI('begin some operation'), resource=dbref)
or
  LOG.info(_LI('begin some operation'), resource=
           mydict{'type': 'volume',
                  'id': '40e0f194-0ccb-422f-a543-c5f9022acb6f')

The result will be the resource identifier prepended to the msg:

  INFO cinder.volume.manager [-]\
  [volume-40e0f194-0ccb-422f-a543-c5f9022acb6f] \
  succesfully deleted volume

This will be in addition to work being done to put the same info in context,
then we'll automatically pick this info up from context if it's there but still
allow it to be overridden with the extra keys in this change.

This commit adds some basic pinning logic that will allow us to make
pinning placements taking into consideration hyperthreading capabilities
of the host (and instances if set).

_numa_fit_instance_cell_with_pinning is the central method that will be
called for each NUMA cell that will eventually be called from
numa_fit_instance_to_host for instances  that will require explicit CPU
pinning.

None of the methods here are meant to be exposed as public methods to be
called outside of numa_fit_instance_to_host, however since they contain
all the placement logic it is useful to test them separately.

This enhancement is useful for determining which hosts will

trove-manage db_load_datastore_config_parameters will fail if
the datastore_version on which it's being run is marked as
inactive (aka active is set to 0).

this is not correct, because it's completely reasonable to want
to update/refresh a datastore_version's configuration-group's
parameters even if it's inactive.

examples:
- you're working on rolling out a new datastore_version, so
  you have it marked as active=0 until the go-live date.
- you've rolled out a new datastore_version and want to
  mark the old version as inactive. instances built prior
  to the inactivation are still on the old version, and
  can still utilize their still-assigned configuration-groups,
  hence the parameters should be updateable by the
  administrator.

With this change both the API and Functional job will benefit
from the use of gate hooks. This is especially useful to make
the API job emit the test results the same way other jobs do.

NOTE: Changes are applied to both contrib directories under
neutron/tests and neutron/tests/functional; these two directories
are supposed to be in sync until change [1] merges, after which
we can drop neutron/tests/functional/contrib, in favor of

Description:
Stale GRE and VXLAN tunnel endpoints persists in neutron db this should be
deleted from the database. Also, if local_ip of L2 agent changes the
stale tunnel ports and flows persists on br-tun on other Compute Nodes and
Network Nodes for that remote ip this should also be removed.

Implementation

Plugin changes:
Added host column in 'ml2_vxlan_endpoints' and 'ml2_gre_endpoints' table.
Added delete_endpoint method for deleting the stale endpoints from db.
Modified tunnel_sync() method to accommodate these changes.
Modified testcases in test_type_vxlan.py
Modified testcases in test_type_gre.py

Agent changes:
Added tunnel_delete rpc for removing stale ports and flows from br-tun.
tunnel_sync rpc signature upgrade to obtain 'host'.
Added testcases for TunnelRpcCallbackMixin().

This patch-set only deals with plugin side changes.

This commit adds the basic framework for validation code needed
for the common cert API.  Note that there is a slight change to
the blueprint in that for the stored-key type, we expect to see
a container_ref rather than a public_key_ref, so that certain
validations (like access to the private key) can be done.

We expect subsequent commits to fill in the missing logic in the
functions and enable the relevant tests.  Also, once this process
is complete, it makes sense to refactor the Validator code along
the lines of bp/split-validator-module.

We currently have a horrible hack for upstart where we run our services
with stdout and stderr piped into logger. There are lots of issues with
this, such as upstart has a hard time knowing which PID to track.
Conveniently, python logging knows how to syslog, so why not just use
that!

This changes the default behaviour of os-svc-daemon to create a python
logging.conf so services log directly to syslog.

This also changes the default upstart respawn limiting to be 2 fails in
10 secs. This is becauce making upstart monitor the actual service
daemon was causing some services to respawn loop due to time it took
them to fail.

Since radvd 2.0, the daemon does not use daemon_fork() function from
libdaemon, but instead calls Linux daemon() function directly. It also
passes (1, 1) arguments when logging method (-m) is either stderr (the
default) or stderr_syslog. The second argument's value = 1 means that
stderr is not closed and left there for (some) log messages.

For neutron, it means that corresponding execute() call that spawns
radvd and expects the invoked process to close stderr does not ever get
completed. The current thread that spawned radvd is locked waiting for
radvd to exit, which does not ever occur unless the process crashes or
receives a signal.

Since L3 agent gives exclusive access to updates queue for each router
to one of processing threads only, it means that the thread that got to
serve a radvd-powered subnet will not proceed and not update any new
ports or other changes to the router anymore.

Passing -m syslog makes radvd 2.0+ close stderr and return to execute()
caller, proceeding with router update processing. The same arguments
should work for old (pre 2.0) versions of radvd too, so passing them
unconditionally.

We could instead use -m logfile and pass appropriate -l <logfile>
argument to radvd to make it log to a log file located in router's
namespace storage path. Though that would be not in line with what
dnsmasq processes currently do for dhcp agent, where we log all messages
to syslog, so sticking to syslog for radvd for consistency.

Juno changes:
- tests: we need to construct RouterInfo to get router namespace name.

This blueprint l2gateway describes a solution to extend
overlay networks into VLANs which are external to the
cloud environment via a gateway, either software or hardware.
The spec proposes a set of APIs that will abstract
a gateway into logical resource(s) and then manage
them.
