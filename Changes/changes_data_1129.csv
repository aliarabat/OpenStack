ML2 mech drivers have no direct exposure to security groups,
and they can only infer them from the associated network/ports.
This is problematic as agentless ML2 mech drivers have no way of
intercepting securitygroups events and propagate the information
to their backend, or more generally, react to them.

This patch leverages the callback registry to dispatch such events
so that interested ML2 mech drivers (or any interested party like
service plugins) can be notified and react accordingly.

This patch addresses create/update/delete of security groups and
create/delete of security groups rules. Other events may be added
over time, if need be.

This patch is only about emitting the events. The actual subscription
and implementation of the event handlers will have to take place where
deemed appropriate.

Revert fix from bug #1329050, which adds a plugin panel to its dashboard's
class. Adding a plugin panel to a dashboard whose class has its panels defined
in a tuple will fail because the new plugin cannot be appended to the tuple.
The code errors out before the panel gets added to the dashboard's panel list.
However, at this point, the panel has already been registered with the
dashboard. This causes Dashboard.get_panels() to see the panel in its registry
but not in its panel groups. Consequently, the panel gets put in the ""Other""
panel group instead of its configured one, as described in bug #1378558.

By not adding the the plugin panel to its dashboard's class, the panel gets
added to its dashboard's panel list. Now the original issue from bug #1329050
resurfaces. The root cause of that is that every time Dashboard._autodiscover()
is called, it instantiates all its panel group classes, wiping out any panels
previously added to any of the panel groups. Avoid this by always processing
all the plugin panel groups before any of the plugin panels, which also ensures
that the panel groups exist before their panels.

Making this change exposed an issue where the Horizon URLs were being loaded
twice during the plugin infrastructure's unit tests, causing plugin panels to
be added multiple times to their dashboards. Fix that by removing the second,
unnecessary call. Also create a second test plugin panel group and panel to
test the scenarios described in the two bugs addressed here, adding two panel
groups at a time.

As both Ubuntu and the MariaDB repositories carry packages with the same
names, apt package pinning is required to ensure that the packages we install
come from the right repository. This patch adds a pinning preference file to
ensure that the packages we install come from the MariaDB repository.

Due to the OpenStack CI images having conflicting packages installed in the
base image, this patch also includes the removal of these packages during the
AIO bootstrap to ensure that the deployment succeeds.

For environments where the same two packages are installed on the hosts prior
to the deployment of os-ansible-deployment, they would need to ensure that the
packages are removed first. This has been seen in environments where
monitoring tooling has installed the packages as a dependancy.

3) DHCP port if enable_dhcp is True, or update to True
4) Others go into allocation_pools
Above 1) to 3) are created by default, which means if CIDR doesn't

This fix is to add some restricts to the issue:
A) When subnet create, if enable_dhcp is True, /31 and /32
   cidrs are forbidden for IPv4 subnets while /127 and /128 cidrs are
   forbidden for IPv6 subnets.
B) When subnet update, if enable_dhcp is changing to True and there are no

We currently can disable computing signature for metering message,
but HBase still uses signature as a dimension to generate unique row
key, this will lead to different samples treated as same one.

Message id should be used in stead of message signature, because
id will always exist and also unique.

Currently, the all_tenants=1 search option is being passed all the
time for 'nova delete' commands in order to enable 'nova delete' by
name to work across tenants, for those that have all_tenants access
in the nova policy.json. This however breaks all 'nova delete' for
non-admins when policy has been configured to allow only admin to
list servers across all_tenants.

This patch changes 'nova delete' to take an option --all-tenants to
get the functionality to delete by name across tenants. This is
similar to how 'nova list --all-tenants' works.

The current code in the servers api assumes only text files will be
provided as userdata. That is, the data is utf-8 encoded before it
is base64 encoded and sent. This breaks for binary userdata files,
(example, gzip files) as they can't be utf-8 encoded.

This change ignores specifically the exceptions that are raised
when utf-8 encoding is attempted on non-text data: AttributeError
and UnicodeDecodeError. These exceptions will be ignored to let
binary files proceed to the base64 encoding step.

service.py had some code where the child process would catch the
SIGTERM from the parent just so it could exit with 1 status rather
than with an indication that it exited due to SIGTERM. When
shutting down the parent doesn't care in what way the child ended,
only that they're all gone, so this code is unnecessary.

Also, for some reason this caused the child to never exit while
there was an open connection from a client. Probably something
with eventlet and signal handling.

Manual import of Translations from Transifex. This change also removes
all po files that are less than 66 per cent translated since such
partially translated files will not help users.

This updates also recreates all pot (translation source files) to
reflect the state of the repository.

This change needs to be done manually since the automatic import does
not handle the proposed branches and we need to sync with latest
translations.

This is part of importing of translations, there are no new
translations for this project, thus only the pot file gets updated.

The use of weakref was introduced as a preventive measure to avoid
potential OOM kills, however that limited our ability to employ
certain functions as callbacks, such as object methods (see [1] for
an example).

Since the adoption of the callback registry, it has been observed that
callbacks are generally long lived (for the entire duration of the
process they belong to), therefore this limitation appears to be too
restrictive at this point in time.

Some might argue that it's better safe than sorry, but until we
have some evidence of actual OOM kills, it's probably best to take
the bolder action of removing the adoption of weak references and
deal with the potential fallout, should it happen.

We can't call child_template() from a validate in ResourceGroup
as it accesses nested(). So move the validation to validate_nested_stack()
so we can control the test template used for validation.

Unfortunately coverage for this got removed during recent test rework

Manual import of Translations from Transifex. This change also removes
all po files that are less than 66 per cent translated since such
partially translated files will not help users.

This updates also recreates all pot (translation source files) to
reflect the state of the repository.

This change needs to be done manually since the automatic import does
not handle the proposed branches and we need to sync with latest
translations.

Note: This is part of importing of translations, there are no new
translations for this project, thus only the pot file gets updated.

A flag (ENABLE_PROFILER) was added to redstack.rc that controls
whether OSProfiler is enabled.  Since this depends on Ceilometer,
Ceilometer is also installed if set to true.

Several configuration variables were added as well to redstack.rc
that can be used to control the behaviour of the profiler.

ENABLE_PROFILER is set to 'false' by default, but can be turned
on easily by adding 'ENABLE_PROFILER=true' to options.rc or by
the command line 'ENABLE_PROFILER=true ./redstack install'.

The current pin priority does not force apt to switch packages that are
already installed to the appropriate MariaDB packages. This results in
deployment failures when other packages like mysql-common happen to be
deployed on the host already for whatever reason.

This patch sets the pin-priority to 1001 which tells apt that the conflicting
package should be replaced, even if it requires a downgrade.

This patch also sets all apt package installation tasks to force the
installation in order to facilitate the downgrade where necessary.

trying to find same host for the new instance.

I3ad7864eeb2f959549ed356a1e34fa18804395cc didn't include any regression unit
tests to validate that the method won't ever log too often again,
reintroducing performance drop in later patches. It didn't play well
with stable backports of the fix, where context was lost when doing the
backport, that left the bug unfixed in stable/juno even though the patch
was merged there [1].

The patch adds an explicit note in the code that suggests not to add new
log messages inside the loop to avoid regression, and a unit test was
added to capture it.

Once the test is merged in master, it will be proposed for stable/juno
inclusion, with additional changes that would fix the regression again.

The loopback handling in the Linux kernel limits the filenames of
files associated to loopback devices, see also linux/loop.h.
This is reflected also on userspace, as kpartx will silently do nothing
(exiting with 0) when requesting to remove a filename longer than 64
characters, as that name will obviously not match the truncated
filename. The result of this is that, when extracting qcow2 images for
the first time, if the qcow2 filename is long enough then the loopback
device will not be removed, remaining as stale in the host.

As a workaround, use a temporary file name when convering a qcow2 image
to raw, instead of using the base name of the qcow2 file.
While this still will not fix the issue when manually using a long
temporary directory (e.g. TMP_DIR=/very/long/etc...), at least should
avoid it in other cases.

It's possible to hit a similar race condition for server groups with
the ""affinity"" policy. Suppose we create a new group and then create two
instances simultaneously. The scheduler sees an empty group for each,
assigns them to different compute nodes, and the policy is violated.

To guard against this, we extend _validate_instance_group_policy()
to cover the ""affinity"" case as well as ""anti-affinity"".

Once undef and unused are enabled, legacy code will throw over 365 errors.
Remember that undef check for undefined variables while unused checks
for unused variables, both are good for quality control.

1. Clean up legacy code
2. Ignore legacy code

Since legacy is stable enough, cleaning it up might have higher risk of

W/o this fix, the timeout command is used with rabbitmqctl
wrapper, which uses a 'su' when invoked as not a rabbitmq user.
This is an issue as the 'su' changes the original
process group. And if the timeout command expired, it would kill
only processes in this original process group, leaving orphaned
commands what do not belong to whis group anymore.

The solution is to issue all timeout wrapped rabbitmqctl commands
as the rabbitmq user in the OCF script.

of routers being synced and it happens even if debugging

This patch adds a new ControllerEnableCephStorage option
which can be used to install and configure Ceph storage
(OSD) on the controller node.

The default is to have this disabled by default (this is
probably a more production like setting).

The motivation for this change is to help facilitate CI
jobs which actually use Ceph. Right now we have an issue
where once the Heat stack finishes Ceph is configured
and ready, but Cinder volume (required by our CI
devtest_overcloud.sh test) may or may not have had
enough time to recognize the amount of storage
on the remote Ceph storage nodes. Waiting another
periodic cycle for Cinder volume to recognize the
actual amount of storage on the remote OSD nodes
would work but there isn't a good way to do this
ATM. The right solution here is probably to
implement Heat breakpoints in our CI. As we haven't quite
landed that change, another option is to simply
make the controller node also be a Ceph storage node.
Since this runs as ""step 2"" within the controller
it ensures that the OSD will be available and thus
Cinder volume will register the correct amount of
storage on startup.

Enabling this feature also matches what we do with Swift
storage on the Controller (although we should provide
an option to actually disable this as well).

is 'ip', a CIDR is completely enumerated into all of its
addresses so 10.100.0.0/16 results in ~65k entries. This
meant a single allowed_address_pairs entry could easily
exhaust an entire set.

This patch changes the hash type to 'net', which is designed
to handle a CIDRs as a single entry.

This patch also changes the names of the ipsets because
creating an ipset with different parameters will cause an
error and our ipset manager code isn't robust enough to handle
that at this time. There is another ongoing patch to fix
that but it won't be ready in time.[1]

The related bug was closed by increasing the set limit, which
did alleviate the problem. However, this change would also
address the issue because the gate tests run an allowed address
pairs extension test with the CIDR mentioned above.

The build host might not necessarily have a complete set of dirs
required in its PATH. It will likely be better to statically code a

Some distros (ex: archlinux) are lacking some dirs commonly found in a
PATH. If this is used as a host OS, it will transfer this incomplete
PATH into the chroot, where other guests (ubuntu, centos) will fail to
find basic binaries due to the lack of a /bin entry.

This patch narrows down the race window between the filter running and
the consumption of resources from the instance after the host has been
chosen.

It does so by re-calculating the fitted NUMA topology just before consuming it
from the chosen host. Thus we avoid any locking, but also make sure that
the host_state is kept as up to date as possible for concurrent
requests, as there is no opportunity for switching threads inside a
consume_from_instance.

Several things worth noting:
  * Scheduler being lock free (and thus racy) does not really affect
  resources other than PCI and NUMA topology this badly - this is due
  to complexity of said resources. In order for scheduler decesions to not
  be based on basically guessing, in case of those two we will likely need
  to introduce either locking or special heuristics.

  * There is a lot of repeated code between the 'consume_from_instance'
  method and the actual filters. This situation should really be fixed but
  is out of scope for this bug fix (which is about preventing valid
  requests failing because of races in the scheduler).

Manual import of Translations from Transifex. This change also removes
all po files that are less than 66 per cent translated since such
partially translated files will not help users.

This updates also recreates all pot (translation source files) to
reflect the state of the repository.

This change needs to be done manually since the automatic import does
not handle the proposed branches and we need to sync with latest
translations.

Note: This is part of importing of translations, there are no new
translations for this project, thus only the pot file gets updated.

With bumping PyECLib up to 1.0.7 on global requirements,
we can use the ""reconstruct"" function directly instead
of the current hack doing decode/encode on reconstructor.
That is because the hack was for treating PyECLib < 1.0.7

@errors_out_migration decorator is used in the compute manager on
resize_instance and finish_resize methods of ComputeManager class.
It is decorated via @utils.expects_func_args('migration') to check
'migration' is a parameter to the decorator method, however, that
only ensures there is a migration argument, not that it's in args or
kwargs (either is fine for what expects_func_args checks).
The errors_out_migration decorator can get a KeyError when checking
kwargs['migration'] and fails to set the migration status to 'error'.

This fixes the KeyError in the decorator by normalizing the args/kwargs
list into a single dict that we can pull the migration from.

'page_size' is used by the dashboard, limit - by the engine, and right
now both of them have the same assumed semantics.

This change makes the client accept both of them (with priority for
'page_size'). This approach should be changed later, if we introduce
some client-side filtering: in this case 'limit' should define the
number of items requested by the client and the page_size should define
the number of items got from the API in each request. Right now this is
not the case, so these two parameters are quite interchangeable.

The switch to the community management layer mixin introduced
several bugs in the NSX-mh plugins.
This patch:
1) Stops creating centralized SNAT interfaces for NSX distributed
   routers. The NSX backend does not need those and they therefore
   only waste IPs and create confusion. This is done by providing
   an empty implementation for the relevant methods.
2) Does not query l3-agents when removing router interface. This
   is causing errors during interface removal and preventing router
   removal, as the NSX plugin does not use l3 agents at all.
   This patch provides an empty implementation for the relevant
   method thus preventing the DVR mixin from doing any sort of
   operations pertaining l3 agents.
3) It ensures DVR router interfaces are taken into account in the
   management of metadata network for routers.

Currently it is pretty cumbersome to specify the puppet module one wants
to test since they are put in the image during build.

The idea of this commit is to allow one to specify a list of module s/he
wants to override for a given run

A puppet-modules file ($TRIPLEO_ROOT/puppet-modules) is formatted as follow:

tripleo https://review.openstack.org/stackforge/puppet-tripleo master
refs/changes/58/175958/2
rabbitmq https://github.com/me/puppetlabs-rabbitmq mybranch

Both puppet-tripleo and puppet-rabbitmq will be overiden in the images
at /opt/stack/puppet-modules/ to apply the one that were specified in
this file.

The Windows SMBFS driver inherits the Linux SMBFS driver,
overriding Windows specific methods.

This commit Ic89cffc93940b7b119cfcde3362f304c9f2875df added the
volume name as an extra argument to the _do_extend_volume in order
to check if differencing images are pointing to backing files other
than the according volume disks.

Although this is not required on Windows, this method should accept
this extra argument in order to have the same signature as the
method it overrides. At the moment, this raises the following
exception:

TypeError: _do_extend_volume() takes exactly 3 arguments (4 given)

Update quota multi-value in one request is not an atomic operation, so
even if a quota is invalid (e.g., volumes has a non-integer value),
some values may change but the response code is 400.

This patch will make sure the quota limits are of integer type for all
the requested quota keys before updating the database.

In order for users to take advantage of COW volumes created from
a glance image, Cinder must be configured to use Glance API version
2 (default is 1). In version 2, the required boot metadata (kernel_id
and ramdisk_id) are no long stored in the 'properties' dict, but as
standalone fields in the GET response from glance. The existing cinder
parser for the glance request is not aware of this and the volume
created form a v2 image will lack this required metadata.

This was causing the recent Ceph CI gate failures for
test_volume_boot_pattern.

Current approach is an error prone, because Debian repos may contain
metadata that doesn't fit our pinning template. Yes, in some cases
our template will work (and it does with upstream Ubuntu and Fuel),
but we want to be flexible and cover all cases.

In order to set corrent pinning, we have to use repo's metadata and
that means download repo's Release file, parse it and create pinning
based on it. In that case we'll use all available pinning rules, so
all possible issues will be up to repo maintainer and not because
we're using error prone approach.

A 'packages.filter()' method was ignoring the 'limit' kwarg parameter by
overriding it with the value of 'page_size' parameter of the
DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE constant if the 'page_size' was not set.

'page_size' is used by the dashboard, limit - by the engine, and right
now both of them have the same assumed semantics.

This change makes the client accept both of them (with priority for
'page_size'). This approach should be changed later, if we introduce
some client-side filtering: in this case 'limit' should define the
number of items requested by the client and the page_size should define
the number of items got from the API in each request. Right now this is
not the case, so these two parameters are quite interchangeable.

* add iburst - send packets with less interval if server unreachable

* add tinker panic 0 - time can be stepped a lot

Currently, nothing prevents the port status to be changed to BUILD
state when get_device_details() is sent by a host that doesn't own
the port.
In some cases the port might stay in BUILD state.
This could happen during a live-migration, or for multi-hosted ports
such as HA ports.
This commit allows the port status modification only if the port
is bound to the host that is asking for it.

This patch fixes a race-condition that occurs when the
scheduler tries to check for dvr serviceable ports before
it schedules a router when a subnet is associated with
a router.

Sometimes the dhcp port creation is delayed and so the
router is not scheduled to the l3-agent.

Also it boosts the scheduling performance on dvr-snat
node for scheduling a router.

This patch will provide a work around to fix this race
condition and to boost the scheduling performance
by scheduling a router on a dvr-snat when
dhcp is enabled on the provided subnet, instead of checking
all the available ports on the subnet.

It's also unclear how useful this is given we already have
the test_preserve_preexisting_port test which is
essentially testing the same scenario, except it's not
run on stable/icehouse or stable/juno since preserving
pre-existing ports in nova wasn't fixed until Kilo.
