This commit reorganizes the validation cli args into:

--validation-errors-fatal
--validation-errors-nonfatal
--validation-warnings-fatal
--validation-warnings-nonfatal

Errors are fatal by default. This is change from the previous behavior.
However, the change is not all that impactful since many of the fatal
validations aren't actually handled by the existing
--validation-errors-fatal.

Warnings are not fatal by default.

The new cli args give better explicit control over how the validations
are handled. This is done in preparation for the subsequent commits in
this patch series to make sure that all validations that are run by
tripleoclient are properly handled by these cli args.

The test_create_ebs_image_and_check_boot test in Tempest does the
following:

1. create volume1 from an image
2. boot server1 from volume1 with delete_on_termination=True and wait
   for the server to be ACTIVE
3. create snapshot from server1 (creates image and volume snapshots)
4. delete server1
5. create server2 from the image snapshot (don't wait for it to be
   ACTIVE - this auto-creates volume2 from the volume snapshot in
   cinder and attaches server2 to it)
6. delete server2 (could still be building/attaching volumes in the
   background)
7. cleanup

There is a race when booting server2, which creates and attaches
volume2, and deleting server2 before it's active.

The volume attach completes and updates the bdm.volume_id in the DB before
we get to _shutdown_instance, but after the delete request is in the API.
The compute API gets potentially stale BDMs and passes those over RPC to
the compute. So we add a check in _shutdown_instance to see if we have
potentially stale volume BDMs and refresh that list if so.

The instance.uuid locks in build_and_run_instance and terminate_instance
create the mutex on the compute host such that the bdm.volume_id should
be set in the database after the volume attach and before terminate_instance
gets the lock. The bdm.volume_id could still be None in _shutdown_instance
if the volume create fails, but we don't have anything to teardown in cinder
in that case anyway.

In the case of the race bug, deleting the volume snapshot in cinder fails
because volume2 was never deleted by nova, so the test fails in
teardown. Note that there is still potential for a race here, this does
not eliminate it, but should narrow the race window.

This also cleans up the logging in attach_block_devices since there
may not be a volume_id at that point (depending on bdm.source_type).

keepalived fails to respawn after crash for > 1.2.11 version.

When keepalived starts, it spawns vrrp thread to monitor vrrp forked
process. It also creates a vrrp pid file. When the process is killed, and
it's restarted, the the new keepalived process runs with -P, so
when we validate whether we are already running,  we check vrrp pid file.
Since we never clean up the file before starting the process, and the process
dies without a chance to clean up the file as part of its signal
handler, respawn never works.

keepalived_respawns test should be skipped until bug is resolved.

When a subnet dict was being created, it was calling
_make_network_dict to get the 'shared' flag for the

function would iterate over the subnets on the passed in
network object, which would trigger a database lookup
of all of the subnets.

This patch just separates the 'shared' flag calculation out
into a separate function that both calls can leverage.

The role was changed to make it compatible with the OpenStack
CI. The changes effect defaults, handlers, and the tests for 
the role and adds gitignore/review files. 

The changes essentially get the role to a state where its passing
the tests which are spinning up a galera cluster, adding users 
and databases, and then testing integrity from every node. The 
tests specifically ensure we're able to guarantee that after the
role runs everything works. Previously to these changes the role
assumed everything was working and nothing had been done to 
guarantee cluster state. 

In the handler changes, the temporary ""sst"" directory is cleaned up
should the handler restart fail. This ensure that a node is in a clean
state if a leftover sst directory was on the disk which would cause 
a node to fail to join a cluster or bootstrap. Additionally the 
environment variable ""MYSQLD_STARTUP_TIMEOUT"" is now being passed
into the init script because the defaults are not being sourced
at the init script runtime. 

In the task changes a new configuration file, that is part of the 
mariadb package, is being removed which has unforeseen options within
it causing no logs to be created.

the default option ""galera_innodb_additional_mem_pool_size"" was removed
because its no longer valid within MariaDB10 and we'd never caught that
error message until now.

The tests were updated to support running the role from a user which 
was not root.

Commit 421850636755a256e8750a7017a28ef072ebcbb4 includes
devstack neutron scripts which triggers a dependency issue
happens in df-ext-services.sh.

df-ext-services.sh which doesn't run under devstack directory cannot
locate $TOP_DIR which points to devstack directory in plugin.sh.

In this patch, we dynamically locates and updates $TOP_DIR
in df-ext-services.sh.

to create_volume, delete_volume and create_cloned_volume to avoid race

in the implementation of delete_snapshot method for snapshot in the next
patch. Also it adds update provider_location and host to mark device as
used to avoid race with other threads. It uses object notation instead
of dict notation to a volume and snapshot.

Currently quotas are sometimes checked in cinder.volume.manager,
and other times checked in cinder.volume.api. This patch is one of
two commits that aim to make these checks more consistent by moving
calls from the manager to the API. This way, we can give the user
feedback before launching the RPC call. If the quotas fail to update,
an exception will be raised in the API to inform the user before
the action takes place unless the force option is set to True.

Instead of launching two separate build jobs in our CI infrastructure,

are short, the setup of the images takes a long time, so this is
friendlier to our CI infrastructure.

Use the pep8 environment as common lint target and merge the bashate job
into it.

into line with all other OpenStack projects.

This is a first implementation of adding TLS termination to the load
balancer in the controllers. The implementation was made so that the
appropriate certificate/private key in PEM format is copied to the
appropriate controller(s) via a software deployment resource.

And the path is then referenced on the HAProxy configuration, but this
part was left commented out because we need to be able to configure the
keystone endpoints in order for this to work properly.

When it gets to submitting & reviewing patches for the project documentation,
it is very convenient to surf through the docs generated by Sphinx in a special
Gate job. The problem is that Sphinx uses in gates a theme which is different
from that used on ReadTheDocs. So the docs generated in gates look differently
from the docs that we have on ReadTheDocs, while the desired behaviour is to
have the same Sphinx theme both on ReadTheDocs and in gates.

Currently murano project has documentation on read the docs

This enables pacemaker maintenantce mode when running Puppet on stack
update. Puppet can try to restart some overcloud services, which
pacemaker tries to prevent, and this can result in a failed Puppet run.

At the end of the puppet run, certain pacemaker resources are restarted
in an additional SoftwareDeployment to make sure that any config changes
have been fully applied. This is only done on stack updates (when
UpdateIdentifier is set to something), because the assumption is that on
stack create services already come up with the correct config.

I took and rewrote a lot of this driver in an out of tree tool for
doing simple power control of amt systems (as amttool no longer works
with new nucs). It's still early, but it means you can drop pywsman
entirely as a dependency, which makes the code less fragile, and more
testable.

This is a first couple of steps in what it would be to convert this
driver. I'm on vacation next week, so pushing in completely broken
state to hopefully inspire someone else to run with it.

We had previously forced nova net with just devstack to not touch eth0
as it is unable to reconfigure it properly on OVH. Instead we use an
internal bridge which is detached from the test host's networking.
However we wrote the config to the wrong localrc when running grenade on
OVH.

Fix this by properly selecting the localrc file based on the test mode
variable. This should write the new networking config to the proper
config file separating grenade + nova-net's network from the test host's
networking.

Many projects like Nova, Ironic etc have implemented the
microversions for versioning their APIs.

Tempest is going to tests those microversions -
I57b78b4c0543b6fb0533b556886a19a03297555e.

For testing microversion in Tempest on gate, we need to set
a valid range of microversion in Tempest config and based on that
Tempest will run appropriate tests.

This commit adds the below range options for compute microversion testing-
- [None, 'latest'] - for master branch as default
- [None, None] - for tests running on v2.0
- option to set the range.

handle this multi-type argument in nearly the same manner. To unify
that usage we can just have a utils method that breaks the multi-type
argument into its components and uniformly use that in drivers.

  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lmysqlclient

It appears Percona-Server-devel package provides a broken
/usr/lib64/libmysqlclient.so that points to nonexistent
libmysqlclient.so.18.

Fix the build by installing MariaDB-shared package from the mariadb
repo that contains the missing file.

Solar provides flexible orchestration and resource management
framework for deploying distributed systems. It leverages abstraction
layer over commonly used configuration management systems like puppet,
ansible etc. to enable complex, multi node orchestration. Solar can be
used as separate tool for quick prototyping deployment topology, but
as a framework it can be also integrated with existing tools used to
configure and deploy distributed systems including OpenStack clouds.
Solar also provides control over resulting changes by introducing
changes log and history for deployment entities. This enables more
control over lifecycle management of infrastructure.

These projects have no stable branches and if they will get them, the
jobs should most likely run there, so remove the branch filter that
filters out all stable branches.

Implement Neutron plugin for stateless architecture. For creating operation,
it simply stores a resource entry in top layer database; for updating and
deleting operations it checks if there exists a resource routing entry, if
so, it not only updates database in top layer but also sends request to bottom
layers; for query, it returns data in bottom layers if routing entry exists,
otherwise returns data in top layer.

Plugin does not maintain routing entries itself, the creator of bottom layer
resources is responsible to add routing entries.

For test purpose, DevStack plugin script is updated to start two other Neutron
servers to simulate bottom layer services.

For now, effectively there could be multiple trusts with the same
project, trustor, trustee, expiry date, impersonation. The same
combination can have multiple trusts assigned with different roles
or not.

Patch fixes this issue by adding unique constraint to the trusts
database model. If two requests create trusts with the same
trustor, trustee, project, expiry, impersonation, then the second
request would bring up an exception saying there's a conflict.

This can help to improve specific trusts identification and
improve user experience.

get_token_data is used to gather various data for token. One of the
checks it does is verifying that the authenticated user is a trustee.
Before Fernet, it was used during token issuing.

Impersonation in trusts substitutes information about user in token,
so instead of trustee, trustor is stored in token.

With Fernet tokens, get_token_data is used during token validation.
In case of impersonation, user_id, stored in Fernet token, is id of
the trustor, but the check described needs this id to be id of the
trustee.

Move the check to happen only on token issuing.

adding the judgment of 'unavailable' size.

Found that pylint 1.5.0 and astroid 1.4.1 generate new errors for pylint
testing. Also, if pin pylint to 1.4.4, which is done in neutron, will have
breakage, because pylint 1.4.4 is not compatible with astroid 1.4.x.

For now, fix is to pin these two in tox.ini to pylint 1.4.4 and astroid
1.3.8.

Later, can implement pep8-constraints job and target for VPN repo, and
that will handle the constraints.

In long term, can migrate to pylint 1.5.0 and resolve the warnings/errors
that crop up. Note: looks like the fixes are not backwards compatible.
Will see if this commit will force pep8 job to use the ""right"" versions.

creates nova.compute.api.SecurityGroupAPI object 183 times. This patch
caches the object after the first creation. Since there are two ways
one can instantiate that API, we cache each independently, dropping the

Instead of having 'self._check' be called at the stat

and placed on the function instead. This way it is a little
more explicit than having it called at the start of each
method.

This also adds a check to ensure the engine has been validated
before it is ran (and the decorator takes into this into
account as well).

There are occasionally some client-specific things that would be handy
to be able to configure about behaviors. For instance, the only config
file that ansible's openstack inventory has is clouds.yaml. Rather than
teaching os-client-config about such things, allow a pass-through config
section. Apply key normalization to _'s like other configs, and merge
the clouds and secure files so that the sections behave like other OCC
config sections.

However, API doc also mentions ""Create image member"" as the API

During the volume ref creation in clone_image_volume
we were including a _name_id attribute which is invalid
in the base olso object.  The result is silent failure
for a key error. Note that the comments for the column
in the db specifcally state ""do not call directly"".
The variable is also denoted as private by the _ prefix.

Fix this by just popping the ""_name_id' attribute.

In addition there were a number of things that needed
some cleanup:
1. Don't iterate over list of tuples to get K/V for dict
   Just use Dict(xxxx)
2. Don't use delete dict.key
   This isn't safe, because if the key DNE you'll get a key exception
   Instead use pop which is safe if key DNE
3. Add an error message when this fails, because currently the logs
   don't give an operation a chance of knowing it failed, let alone
   an opportunity to debug it

Finally the cache volume creation is still calling the db
directly and doing a resource create as opposed to
using the new volume object create handler.  I went ahead
and converted this to use objects, however that resulted in
breaking two of the volume-->image unit tests that use cinder
as a glance backend.

I've opened bug 1525773 for those issues and added a skip
to the tests in question.

2.12 - Exposes VIF net-id attribute in os-virtual-interfaces. User will be
able to get Virtual Interfaces net-id in Virtual Interfaces list and can
determine in which network a Virtual Interface is plugged into.

novaclient.base.Resource class is a parent class of VirtualInterface resource.
Since `Resource` is a universal interface for any resources and doesn't
require hard-code attributes which describe partial resource, there are no
required changes to support this microversion in ""novaclient as a lib"".

""novaclient as CLI"" doesn't provide an interface for VirtualInterface yet
(see bug 1522424 for more details). When it will be implemented, we will need
to check that new attribute is displayed correctly.

Based on the fact that 1522424 is not resolved and novaclient.base.Resource
class has enough tests, this patch doesn't require any tests.

Also this patch fixes representation of VirtualInterface resource.

Puppet OpenStack CI is hitting this bug:
https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4149

It affects the latest bundler release that is used in Puppet OpenStack
CI jobs (and breaking syntax3 and unit3.x).

The patch that fix bundler has been fixed but is not in the latest
release.
We had 2 options to fix it:
* patch 26 modules with the dependency in Gemfile, plus backport patches
  in stable branches, which is around 100 patches + 100 other patches
  when bundler is fixed (200 patches).
* patch jenkins/jobs/puppet-module-jobs.yaml to pin bundler with a
  previous release, until bundler has a new release.

Puppet OpenStack group decided to choose option #2 and fix it by pinning
Bundler to 1.10.6.

Bundler team does not seems ready to provide a release:

The wrap_exception decorator that attempts to send a notification when
exceptions occur was not sending all the arguments it was intending to.
It relies on getcallargs to get the arguments and argument names for the
called method but if the method has another decorator on it getcallargs
pulls information for the decorator rather than the decorated method.
This pulls the decorated method with get_wrapped_function and then calls
getcallargs.

get_wrapped_function was moved to safeutils because utils.py can't be
imported by exception.py without a circular import.

A few tests were updated to include the id on the instance object used.
This was done because serialization of the object includes the
instance.name field which assumes that id is set to populate the
CONF.instance_name_template.  When id is not set it triggers a lazy load
which fails in the test environment.

The getcallargs method was written under the assumption that self was
not passed in as an argument even if the function being introspected
took self as an argument.  Since safeutils.getcallargs is modeled on
inspect.getcallargs which does require self to be passed in the wrong
interface was being provided.

The initial user of getcallargs was therefore calling it incorrectly and
this usage was copied to other places.  However this led to strange
failures when someone attempted to call the method correctly.  So this
patch fixes callers of getcallargs, and removes some code from the
implementation that is not necessary once the usage is fixed.

os-svc-install script calls.  This patch also adds sets pipefail
where apropriate to pass dib-lint and fixes a small spelling nit.
