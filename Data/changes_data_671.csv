Implements RBAC tests for the following policy actions:
  - events:list
  - events:show

However, events:list can be covered by the 2 events endpoints
below:
  - list_events

Consequently, this patch adds 2 tests, one test for events:show,
and one test for events:list, with 2 client calls that correspond
to that policy action underneath swithToRbacRole=True.

Earlier we placed these files in the jenkins user's homedir. That was
causing a problem so the cache directory was moved into /opt and
symlinked for backwards compatibility[1]. However, the jenkins user
doesn't have write access to directories created by root and will fail
to write files to that directory in devstack-gate[2][3]. This patch
changes the ownership of the cache directory back to the jenkins user so
that it should work the same as it worked when the directory was in the

Similar to change I498791614fd456ab67c453cad691f7658d107123,
we can avoid an unnecessary network retrieval by making the network
part of the subnet context lazily loaded by allowing None to be
passed into the subnet context.

If a driver does need items off of the network, the context will
trigger a lookup at the time of reference.

All tempest tests that are located in single class always run
serially. And one of our classes that performs lots of different
share migration tests takes about 20 minutes. So, split them up
to separate classes to speed up test run.

This fix also includes a trivial optimization to the 'opposite driver
modes migration test' as was proposed in
commit 1181a80bf6473d3fe7ed83c0b1df7c738c2a71e5.

The policy.json file is currently read continually by the
services and is not only read on service start. We therefore
cannot template directly to the file read by the service
(if the service is already running) because the new policies
may not be valid until the service restarts. This is
particularly important during a major upgrade. We therefore
only put the policy file in place after the service restart.

tasks to simplify them and reduce the tasks/code a little.

This patch adjusts the DHCP agent to lock based on

sync_state calls are still protected with a reader/writer

In Swift, we have a public access endpoint ""/info"", which
returns basics like version number, maximum object name length,
and such. When a user accesses it, the request travels the
pipeline, including authtoken, and since it has no valid token,
a message is logged. At some installations, monitoring agents
poll ""/info"" to see if Swift is up, and this floods the logs.

It would be best for us to dispose with this message altogether,
but I am concerned that operators of other services may find
this message useful. So, let's only mark it as a debug level.

The existing version of the callback fixture patches the global var
_CALLBACK_MANAGER, which, is returned from the callback registry
via _get_callback_manager() using a singleton checking pattern.
While this is fine in a number of cases, the implementation of
_get_callback_manager() will enclose a reference to the
_CALLBACK_MANAGER under certain testing conditions causing the fixture
to not work properly.

This patch proposes that we just mock the _get_callback_manager() return
value, which works in all cases.

No release note included because this only changes internal semantics.

Setting up rules to allow DHCPv6, DHCP, and RAs from specific
IP addresses based on Neutron resources has a few issues:

1. It violates separation of concerns. We are implementing logic to
   calculate where an IPv6 RA advertisement or DHCP advertisement
   should be coming from in the security group code. This code should
   not be trying to guess IPv6 LLAs, know about subnet modes, DHCP server
   implementations, or the type of L3 plugin being used. Currently all
   of these assumptions are baked into code that should only be
   filtering, which makes it very rigid and brittle when it comes to
   other implementations for DHCP and/or RAs.
2. It has scaling issues on large networks. Every time one of these
   provider rules is updated, it triggers every L2 agent to refresh
   all of the security group rules for ports in that network, which puts
   significant load on the server.
3. It's main purpose: preventing spoofing of RA[1,2] and DHCP packets,
   has long been superceded by preventing VMs from acting as DHCP/RA
   servers[3][4].

This patch completely removes all of this logic and just returns
static provider rules to the agents that allow all DHCP server
and RA traffic ingress to the client. This addresses the issues
highlighted above since the code is significantly simplified and
the provider rules don't require refreshes on the agents.

Now that the provider rules never change, the RPC notification
listener on the agent-side for 'notify_provider_updated' is now
just a NOOP that doesn't trigger any refreshes. The notification
was left in place on the server side for older version agents
that have stale IP-specific provider rules. The entire notification
can be removed in the future.

The one open concern with this approach is that VMs will now be
able to receive DHCP offers from other DHCP servers on the same
network that aren't being filtered (e.g. a VM with port security
disabled or another device on a provider network). In order to
address this for DHCP, this patch adds two rules that only allow
DHCP offers targeted to either the broadcast or the correct client
IP. This prevents incorrect offers from ever reaching the client.
For RAs, this patch just allows all RAs so we may pick up
advertisements from other v6 routers attached to a network;
however, the instance won't actually be allowed to use bad addresses.

Libvirt does not set the MTU of the tap device it creates when creating
a bridge interface. It also does not set the MTU of the bridge itself.
This cannot be fixed on the Nova side since libvirt doesn't appear to
have support for setting MTUs on bridges until version 3x.

This results in a situation where the first VM tap interface attached to
a bridge will always have an MTU of 1500. The Neutron agent will then
add in VLAN/VXLAN interfaces with the correct MTU; however, the bridge
MTU will still be pinned to the smallest interface MTU attached to it.
This breaks jumbo frames until all small MTU tap devices are removed
from the bridge.

This patch explicitly sets the MTU on tap devices to match the network
MTU when processing the device.

We will have to carry this workaround until we stop Nova from
plugging taps into bridges[1] or until we drop support for older
libvirts on the Nova side and have it set the MTU.

This bug was introduced by change
I53c0eb57da956b36f09731d25db989719e9bc9dc which reverted automatic
setting of tap MTUs to match those of the physical device.

It is possible that _update_port_binding_for_instance() is called
without a migration object, such as when a user unshelves an instance.

If the instance has a port(s) with a PCI device binding, the current
logic extracts a pci mapping from old to new devices from the migration
object and migration context.  If a 'new' device is not found in the
PCI mapping, an exception is thrown.

In the case of an unshelve, there is no migration object (or migration
context), and as such we have an empty pci mapping.

This fix will only check for a new device if we have a migration object.

This is an integer that defaults to zero. This can be used by API services

the test was to verify, in Newton, that the blocker migration caught the thing

is not worth the acrobatics that would be required to keep it working. (Note
that we haven't even had such tests for many of our blocker migrations)

Similar to change I498791614fd456ab67c453cad691f7658d107123,
we can avoid an unnecessary network retrieval by making the network
part of the subnet context lazily loaded by allowing None to be
passed into the subnet context.

If a driver does need items off of the network, the context will
trigger a lookup at the time of reference.

The Subnet model has a relationship to Network that is only
used for bumping the revision of the network. However, loading
the network loads all of its relationships as well so we end
up wasting a bunch of time loading segments, DHCP agents, etc all
for no reason. During a subnet update, we get the subnet from the
DB several times (policy engine, before update, after update,
and dhcp agent scheduler) so the slowness in get_subnet is amplified.

The recent switch to subqueries[1] has made loading all of this
unrelated data much more expensive since each relationship requires
a query, which was likely what brought this problem to the surface.

This adjusts the relationship to just load the standard attr object
of the network directly so we can still bump the revision of the network
without having to load the network itself.

This resulted in a ~20%-30% reduction of time spent in single update-subnet
operations on my dev environment (1sec to 650-850ms).

In a microversion 1.7 change PUT /resource_classes/{name} so that
creation and existence validation of a custom resource class can
happen in a single request and prevent the previous behavior of
being able to update a single resource class to a new name, which is
not desirable.

The previous update_resource_class is still in place to support
microversion 1.2-1.6.

The original resource-classs.yaml sets the default microversion
header to 'latest' so for those existing tests that are using the
old style of PUT, a '1.6' header has been added. New files for
version 1.6 (to add a ""no 1.7 behavior here"" test) and 1.7 (testing
the new PUT behavior and explicitly verifying POST to create is
still around) are added.

After creating the container or configuring the bind mounts for
the container, we used a task to wait for SSH to respond on the
container, using the Ansible wait_for module trying to connect to
port 22.

When managing containers in Ansible using other connection plugins
that use LXC commands on the physical host to execute modules,
there may not be an SSH daemon running within the container. In
these situations we can accomplish the same check without SSH by
using the wait_for_connection module (new in ansible 2.3) to verify
that Ansible has a working execution path into the container, but
not necessarily via SSH.

For whatever reason, the source-repositories caching element is
running in the very early extra-data phase of disk-image-builder.
cache-devstack is instructing source-repositories to put the cached
urls into /home/jenkins/cache/files (55-cache-devstack-repos makes up
the list of images to download from devstack; the other two are just
pre-configured URLS).

This causes a problem when trying to add the jenkins user later in
jenkins-slave/install.d/20-jenkins-slave.  Since source repositories
has already created /home/jenkins, useradd won't do it again and does
not copy in any of the skeleton files.

This moves the extra-data phase caching into /opt/cache, which is
probably a more logical place for it anyway.  To maintain the status
quo, after we create the jenkins user, symlink ~jenkins/cache/files to
this new location.

This was probably going wrong with puppet too.  I'm guessing it just
ignored the existing homedir when creating the user.  I have tested
this by building trusty and stopping the build before and after the
useradd calls in 20-jenkins-slave.  ""/home"" was empty, the useradd
creates the user, group & directory, the symlink is made correctly and
/opt/cache/files appears populated as usual.

shared provider characteristic, and this patch adds it
MISC_SHARES_VIA_AGGREGATE along with a fairly lengthy explanation of the

When the percona-cluster charm sets an access-network but the default
unit-get address is not on that network extra shared-db relations get
executed. This is specifically a problem when running upgrades and
trying to avoid API downtime.

The root cause is that the access-network is not checked until the
SharedDBContext is consulted. But then db_joined function will
change it back to the wrong ip on subsequent runs.

This change adds a check for access-network on the relation during
the db_joined function and pushes IP selection off to
get_relation_ip.

Charm helpers sync to pull in changes to get_relation_ip.

lazy-load physically will not work if we're in the cell, and is

The definition of TemplateResource.regenerate_info_schema() has the effect
of changing the semantics of handle_update() in odd ways. For all other
resource types, self.properties is set to the existing properties
definition of the resource at the time that handle_update() is called
(passing the new resource definition as an argument. However,
TemplateResource is an exception because regenerate_info_schema() replaces
self.properties with the new values from the new resource definition.

To reduce confusion and make all resources consistent in their semantics,

The current mechanism implemented in
https://review.openstack.org/458890 does not work
and causes jobs to fail when multiple dependent
patches are included in a patch. This is due to
the spacing in the values of ZUUL_CHANGE_IDS.

This mechanism instead outputs the data to a
file which can be appropriately sourced by the
functional test script to achieve the same goal
and be less of a maintenance burden.

So currently when we create an IPv6 VIP in puppet the
services running on the node where the VIP is, are susceptible
to using the VIP as a source address in their communication.
When the VIP relocates to another node, those TCP connections
using the VIP as a source will be hanging until a TCP timeout
kicks in.

There are many ways to guide the kernel in a source address selection
with IPv6 (call ""ip -6 addr add <...> "" with the ""noprefixroute"", use
address labels, or simply set the deprecated option on the created
ip address). We are choosing address labels because it is already
supported in the resource-agents package and seems the recommended
way of doing things.

This allows to do:

   local_address = eth0

And let bagpipe-bgp determine that the IP address to use as the local address
is the first IPv4 address of eth0.

It is still allowed to directly specify an IP address:

   local_address = 10.0.1.1

This change also applies the same behavior for dataplane_local_address.

The puppet-redis module makes use of the exec puppet tag to copy the
/etc/redis.conf.puppet file to /etc/redis.conf. We need to explicitly
enable it otherwise our redis container will pick up the default redis
configuration and not the one that was generated with puppet.

Also creates the /var/run/redis directory on the host since we bind
mount /run, and ensure the container sets the correct ownership on the
directory.

Finally, configure redis to not daemonize otherwise the container ends
up in a restart loop.

In change Ib62001c03e1e08f58cf0c6e0ba07a8879a584084 we switched the
rabbitmq queues HA mode from ha-all to ha-exactly. While this gives us a
nice performance boost with rabbitmq, it makes rabbit less resilient to
network glitches as we painfully found out via
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1441635.

This is the THT part of the change that changes the default to
ha-mode: all.

NB: not clean cherry-pick due to the added metadata_settings line in
master

This patch is reproposal of change proposed by Andreas at
I12d1310b8df30f5fbae4cb9c8e804d34c20ee7c9 planned for Ocata.

The goal is to provide nova the required portbinding information
for live migration. This spec proposes to allow a port to have
a second inactive binding. During migration, the host that
runs the instance has the active binding, while the binding
belonging to the other host is inactive.

A new API is required to externalize this new inactive binding.

Ubuntu Xenial adds several services to its base image that we don't

all containers we run. This consuming resources and is making our base

packages which removes the services.

After configuring networking in the container, we used a task to wait
for SSH to respond on the container, using the Ansible wait_for module
trying to connect to port 22.

When managing containers in Ansible using other connection plugins that
use LXC commands on the physical host to execute modules, there may not
be an SSH daemon running within the container. In these situations we
can rely on the Ansible ""ping"" module to verify that we can execute
tasks within the container, despite port 22 not being reachable
in all instances.

This is a re-implementation of https://review.openstack.org/386835 in
an Ansible 2.2 compatible way.

The policy.json file is currently read continually by the
services and is not only read on service start. We therefore
cannot template directly to the file read by the service
(if the service is already running) because the new policies
may not be valid until the service restarts. This is
particularly important during a major upgrade. We therefore
only put the policy file in place after the service restart.

This patch also tidies up the handlers and some of the install
tasks to simplify them and reduce the tasks/code a little.

1. What is the problem?
Multi-region test has been added to our check/gate jobs, but the
test just installs Tricircle via DevStack and doesn't provision
any resources like network/subnet/router/server, so Tricircle
functionality is not tested.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
Add a script in the test to create a basic network topology via
central Neutron and check if local resources are correctly created.
In the topology, two tenant networks are connected by a router, an
external network is attached to the router. We boot one server in
each tenant network and associate a floating IP to one of the server.

This patch also fixes a problem brought by
(1) Eliminate lookup of ""resource extend"" funcs by name
https://github.com/openstack/neutron/commit/92372b982f2cc9f7cda8ac3f3b3e78e46201720f

(2) Defer service_plugins configuration
https://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack/commit/a8204752e32ff619aa4d94409d7427bee0c50864

We can put these changes in a standalone patch, but let's first put them
here to test by this smoke test.

3. What features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
to realize the solution?
Tricircle functionality can be tested.

The proxy server on occasion has error limited a node by the time the
test runs, causing the proxie's node_iter failing to iter out this
error limited  node. As the test uses a default FakeRing with no
extra handoffs, on this occasion we only get 2 requests which is not
enough for quorum, causing it to return a 503.

This patch sets the error_suppression_interval to 0 when creating
the proxy server. Meaning a node effectively isn't error_limited.

A change was done in puppet-ironic:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/457478/

It broke TripleO upgrades because ironic-dbsync.log used to be owned by
root:root and now it's managed by ironic user in puppet-ironic, which is
good.

Because we want to support existing deployments, we need a way to handle
the new owership change, so let's do it in a upgrade task in
undercloud.py. Puppet will be able to run ironic-dbsync and we'll remove
this workaround after Pike release.

As described in the new in-line comment, the point of
devstack-early.txt is to capture output from stack.sh before it
switches itself to devstack.txt.

When stack.sh starts, it just does ""set +x"" ... this means tracing is
coming out on stderr.  ansible consumes all out and then, when the
command finishes, prints stdout and *then* stderr.  This is really
quite useless for tracing purposes, where obviously you want the
tracing interspaced with any command output.

To avoid this, redirect stderr to stdout on these ansible calls.  This
will ensure everything comes out sequentially.

When retrieving resource usage, the current code calls subnet_list
twice for shared=False/True, but 'shared' attribute of subnet is
not defined in the Networking API and actually there is no need to
use it (even though it works as expected accidentally).

What we need here is to specify tenant_id as a query parameter
with a single API to limit the scope to a given project.

The same way can be used for network_list() and router_list() calls
and it is more efficient. By doing so, we now need only one
network_list() call.

Previously translated messages are included in log messages
and it was determined what language is chosen by users.
It makes difficult for operators to understand log messgaes.

This commit tries to use English messages for all log messages.
The following policies are applied based on the past discussions
in the bug 1406333 and related reviews.

- English messages are used for log messages.
- log messages include exception messages if possible
  to help operators identify what happens.
- Use ID rather than name for log messages
  as ID is much more unique compared to name.
- LOG.debug() in success code path are deleted.
  We don't log success messages in most places and API calls to
  back-end services can be logged from python bindings.

We have signaled many times the use of API extensions to change the API
has been deprecated, including:
04f8612aa99e618767a85d2f674ecdfc01955ff7

This patch ensures we no longer check any of the discoverable rules when
compiling the list of extensions to list in the API. This stops users
from being able to use policy to hide certain API extensions. This was
never that useful, but now you can't turn any extensions off and we
report the API version number, it is basically useless.

Note the change in the policy cmd unit test is to ensure now there are
no rules that use the ANY rule, we correctly check we return an empty
list of rules that match.

It is possible that _update_port_binding_for_instance() is called
without a migration object, such as when a user unshelves an instance.

If the instance has a port(s) with a PCI device binding, the current
logic extracts a pci mapping from old to new devices from the migration
object and migration context.  If a 'new' device is not found in the
PCI mapping, an exception is thrown.

In the case of an unshelve, there is no migration object (or migration
context), and as such we have an empty pci mapping.

This fix will only check for a new device if we have a migration object.

Currently, when a new process is spawned on Windows, the
subprocess module is used. When it will run from inside
a greenthread it will try to set non-blocking mode on the
anonymous pipes that it creates for the process stdin, stdout
and stderr. This is not supported in Windows.

This patch changes the usage of subprocess.Popen with
CreateProcess and implements non-blocking I/O using NamedPipes.
The files obtained from CreateFile on the NamedPipe will be
passed as stdin, stdout and stderr to the new process spawned
with CreateProcess. In order to communicate with the new
process, overlapped structures are used to ensure that
the greenthread will not be blocked.

The Host entry in /etc/ssh/ssh_config file on Fedora 25+ is commented
because there is an Include directive and the custom settings have
been moved to a file there.
This leads to a failure when the augeas lens tries to write to that
files. If I read the schema correctly, the lens assumes that the Host
entry is available/uncommented (this it was the case before in Fedora,
and in CentOS and RHEL, and in Debian/Ubuntu, where a customization
is a applied to the upstream default file, which is used as it is now
in Fedora).
This maybe could be an issue of the lens which may not assume that
key, but I'm not sure whether is possible.
In the meantime, use the existing customization file on Fedora,
instead of /etc/ssh/ssh_config.

The systemd unit 'TimeoutSec' value which controls the time
between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived
sessions to drain while preventing new ones from starting
before a restart or a stop.

The 'RestartSec' value which controls the time between the
service stop and start when restarting has been reduced from
150 seconds to 2 seconds to make the restart happen faster.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides

after merge of [1] to manila and usage of 2.6+ microversion in Manila UI.
The reason why [1] had influence is in changed share view that became
incompatible with 'choices' in UI that depend on share type names.
So, start using correct field 'share_type_name', that will set default
value for share type omitting the need to set it manually all the time,
it also will trigger correct snapshot ID selection for request.
Also, fix logic for second+ attempt, where we were using different set

This patchset changes this behavior, by appending IPAllocations to the

The policy.json file is currently read continually by the
services and is not only read on service start. We therefore
cannot template directly to the file read by the service
(if the service is already running) because the new policies
may not be valid until the service restarts. This is
particularly important during a major upgrade. We therefore
only put the policy file in place after the service restart.

This patch also tidies up the handlers and some of the install
tasks to simplify them and reduce the tasks/code a little.

This creates a specific slice which all OpenStack services will operate
from. By creating an independent slice these components will be governed
away from the system slice allowing us to better optimise resource
consumption.

See the following for more information on slices:

See for following for more information on resource controls:

* https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html

Tools like ``systemd-cgtop`` and ``systemd-cgls`` will now give us
insight into specific processes, process groups, and resouce consumption
in ways that we've not had access to before. To enable some of this reporting
the accounting options have been added to the [Service] section of the unit
