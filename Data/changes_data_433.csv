We always run DB sync in deploy_tasks, ensuring that the database is
up to date. We should follow up with online data migrations
too.

Doing this via docker_config has 2 purposes:

* We can easily ensure this happens in a container with the right
  config files mounted.

* We can even apply this via a minor update. This is important because
  we'll have to backport this all the way to Pike and apply it there
  using Pike containers, before upgrading to Queens containers.

There's an additional issue to consider: In Puppet service variant we
ran the online migrations for release X before upgrading to X+1, but
the proposed Docker variant migrations for X run with upgrade to
X. This means that when switching from non-containerized to
containerized, we'll need to run migrations twice, to correctly switch
between the aforementioned approaches.

It is possible for volumes, created from storage pools
which have zero-padding disabled, to contain previous data. This
change prevents these volumes from being created by default. A
user can override this behavior by acknowleding the possibility
with a configuration option.

This is a squash of the four commits that led to the final state in
rocky to not allow the creation of any type of non-zero-padded volumes
to be created. This adds a config option that defaults to the safe
behavior. It is backporting a new config option, and a change in default
behavior, but it should be acceptable in this case so that the security
vulnerability can be addressed.

When HA router's interface on host is going DOWN but router
is still available on this host, L2 population
mechanism driver will now send to other hosts info to remove
fdb unicast entries to this port on host.

It will not send FLOODING_ENTRY because this port is still on
host but in standby mode and might be transformed to master
in future.

This solves issue with migration router from Legacy to HA.
In such case, port which was originally attached to legacy
router is transformed to be HA backup port before changing
its status to DOWN.
Now in such case unicast entries to this port and backup
node will be removed properly so packets to HA router will
be really send to host which is master node for router.

Bug 1789878 describes why the current implementation of traffic
redirection for router fallback has been defeated by change
Ib6ced838a7ec6d5c459a8475318556001c31bdf which was brought in the neutron
ovs firewalling code.

This change moves the place where we put a higher priority
rule to override the NORMAL action to the ACCEPTED_EGRESS_TRAFFIC_NORMAL_TABLE,
which is added by I60d299275effd9ef35c8007773d3c9fcabfa50fa to
re-introduce a single table where NORMAL happens for egress traffic.

This change anticipates the release of neutron 13.0.1 which
will include https://review.openstack.org/599622 . A simple
recheck will be sufficient to progress this change once the
actual release has been made.

The current bluestore disk label naming is inconsistent with the
filestore. The filestore naming format is that the disk prefixes
belonging to the same osd are the same and the suffixes are
different.

This patch keeps the bluestore's disk naming as well.

Current iSCSI device detection checks for the presence of devices based
on the scan time, so it checks for presence, sleeps, scans, and checks
again.  This means that if the device becomes available while we sleep
to send another scan we won't detect the device.

This patch changes this, making the searching and the rescanning
independent operations operating at different cadences.

Checking for the device will happen every seconds, and the rescans will
happen after 4, 9, and 16 seconds.

lxc3 deprecates many legacy config keys [1].

This change ensures that containers created on systems with lxc3
use the appropriate apparmor config keys. At this point we do not
need to address lxc2->lxc3 upgrades as these would only occur
during a Xenial->Bionic in-place OS upgrade, which is an unsupported
upgrade path.

Now that we're using the general templates, we can slim down
the role test definitions. We can also remove tests which are
not being watched, or which are fundamentally broken. With
this we can also remove unused scripts/plays.

We do the following:

1. We remove the 'ssl' job, given that the person working on
   that is no longer doing so, and no-one else has picked up
   the work.
2. We promote the centos-7 distro_install job, given that it
   is now working.

The help for the [pci]aliases config option was confusing in that it
wasn't clear how to specify multiple aliases. The default value being []
made it seem like you ought to be able to specify a list as:

 alias = [{...}, {...}, ...]

This won't actually work; you instead have to say:

 alias = {...}
 alias = {...}
 ...

So this patch adds a multi-alias example to the help string and
explicitly calls out the fact that you can't use list values.

See the referenced bug for more details.

We started generating container image parameters from
ContainerImagePrepare stack parameter. However, this processing was
done in deployment workflow, and as such it was used only when the
full deployment was performed, it was skipped during updates and
upgrades, resulting in ContainerImagePrepare parameter being
effectively ignored, and the conainter image URLs pointing to their
default locations.

To correctly process the ContainerImagePrepare parameter every time
we're updating the deployment plan, we should move the logic from
deployment workflow to plan_management workflows. These are used on
deploy, update, and upgrade, and should contain such common logic.

Zun creates docker network by passing the subnetpool and subnet
to kuryr-libnetwork. However, kuryr-libnetwork has an issue on
unseting neutron ports if a subnetpool is passed.
This commit avoid passing subnetpool when creating the docker
network.

Note: we passed subnetpool to kuryr in before because
kuryr doesn't take subnet as an input at that time so
we pass subnetpool for kuryr to search for the subnet.
Right now, kuryr support directly taking subnet as input so
subnetpool is not needed anymore.

Horizon test setting no longer depends on nose and related stuffs.
This commit cleans up nose related dependencies.

The change was made in horizon Rocky-3,
so horizon 14.0.0.0b3 is required at least.

Filenames of test modules need to start with test_*
so that Django test runner detects them.
There is no test defined but it would be nice to adjust the filename.

In order to allow the ironic inspector dnsmasq service to
receive packets after the network service is restarted, the
bind-interfaces option should not be set.  Since the
ironic inspector is bound to the br-ctlplane interface,
its not necessary to set this field as this dnsmasq instance
will only service this interface.

From the dnsmasq man page (http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html).
-z, --bind-interfaces
On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address,
even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then
discards requests that it shouldn't reply to. This has the
advantage of working even when interfaces come and go and
change address. This option forces dnsmasq to really bind only
the interfaces it is listening on. About the only time when
this is useful is when running another nameserver (or another
instance of dnsmasq) on the same machine. Setting this option
also enables multiple instances of dnsmasq which provide DHCP
service to run in the same machine.

We do run another dnsmasq instance for neutron but that is bound to
the tap interface in the namespace.

This patch is fixing a problem which left the external/gateway's router
port with status DOWN even after the port was bound to a chassis.

Since the Logical_Router_Port table in OVNNB does not have a ""up"" column
(like the Logical_Switch_Port table has) the status of those ports can
not be updpated based on it. Therefore, this patch uses the ""chassis""
column for that. If the router port has the ""chassis"" column in OVNNB
database set, the binding and status ACTIVE will be set in Neutron
otherwise it status will be udpated to DOWN (if it's not DOWN yet).

When running our plugins we're seeing a severe performance impact in

There is no guarantee that all container IP addressess will be included
in an existing no_proxy environment variable. This will cause failures
when an http proxy is configured, but the proxy does not allow traffic
to 'hairpin' back to internal addresses.

This change forces no_proxy to the specific address of the kibana

When using distributed floating IPs, we set the external MAC
address and logical port fields regardless whether the LSP
is up. For the particular use of Octavia LB VIP, which doesn't
ever get bound, the floating IP associated to it will never
get the flows installed by ovn-controller.

This patch changes the mechanism so that the DNAT entries get
updated only on port up/down changes. If the port remains
down, the external_mac will be cleared and traffic to those
FIPs will still go through the centralized router.
When a port gets bound to a chassis, if DVR is enabled, the
mac_address field will be populated and traffic will go to
the compute node.

Scheduler hints are not really documented very well at all except
for being mentioned per scheduler filter in the admin configuration
guide, nor are they documented within relation to flavor extra
specs which are both used for impacting scheduling decisions and
are choices that a deployer has to make based on how they configure
their cloud.

This change adds a document about scheduler hints and how they are
similar to and different from flavor extra specs, including end
user discoverability and interoperability, and thoughts on which
should be used if writing a custom scheduler filter.

The TODO in the API guide is also resolved by linking to this

The cancel_all_events function was incorrectly assuming
that event tags didn't have dashes in them, but they all
do since they are either port or volume IDs, which are UUIDs.

Instead of just storing our event data indexed by the composite
event key, we should just store the name and tag distinctly so
that there is no question about how to dissect the two from the
key later. This is all internal record-keeping inside of the
compute manager, so we can change it to whatever we want.

This includes a slight change to the internal virtapi interface
for wait_for_instance_event(), which removes the ability to
pass composite event keys as strings instead of (name, tag)
tuples. In reality, none of the virt code was using the key string
format, so this just cleans up a few tests that were. It makes
that interface less ambiguous, which is good anyway.

In the legacy path we reparse a resource definition to refer to a different
StackDefinition when copying a resource definition into the existing
template (as the resource is updated) or into the backup stack's template.
However, the resources 'condition' may reference conditionals that are not
defined in the template it is being copied into (e.g. during a stack update
that creates a new condition), and in this case the destination template
will become unusable.

Since the fact that we care about the resource definition at all indicates
that the condition was enabled, just ignore the condition after reparsing.
This is consistent with what we do for 'if' macros, which is to resolve the
condition part during reparsing.

We always run DB sync in deploy_tasks, ensuring that the database is
up to date. We should follow up with online data migrations
too.

Doing this via docker_config has 2 purposes:

* We can easily ensure this happens in a container with the right
  config files mounted.

* We can even apply this via a minor update. This is important because
  we'll have to backport this all the way to Pike and apply it there
  using Pike containers, before upgrading to Queens containers.

There's an additional issue to consider: In Puppet service variant we
ran the online migrations for release X before upgrading to X+1, but
the proposed Docker variant migrations for X run with upgrade to
X. This means that when switching from non-containerized to
containerized, we'll need to run migrations twice, to correctly switch
between the aforementioned approaches.

This patch is fixing a problem which left the external/gateway's router
port with status DOWN even after the port was bound to a chassis.

Since the Logical_Router_Port table in OVNNB does not have a ""up"" column
(like the Logical_Switch_Port table has) the status of those ports can
not be updpated based on it. Therefore, this patch uses the ""chassis""
column for that. If the router port has the ""chassis"" column in OVNNB
database set, the binding and status ACTIVE will be set in Neutron
otherwise it status will be udpated to DOWN (if it's not DOWN yet).

There is a log message in the scheduler which dumps all instances
running on a compute host. There are at least 2 problems with this:
1. it generates huge amount of logs which are not really useful
2. it crashes when there is an instance with non-ascii name

Instead of fixing 2), just print instance UUIDs.

A new feature has been introduced in core OVN which allows to define
a group of ports and assign ACLs to those. This patch is making use
of the new feature if supported by the underlying OVS version.

As a result we'll be modelling Neutron Security Groups as OVN Port
Groups and we won't be adding one ACL per Security Group Rule per
port. Instead, just add one single ACL per Security Group. This will
also tackle the race conditions that we had for Address Sets as those
will just be used for Remote Security Groups and will be automatically
generated/deleted by core OVN in SB database upon Port Group creation/
deletion.

The major benefit of this patch is that we'll reduce the number of
ACL's dramatically, resulting in a performance leap as discussed at:
https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-discuss/2018-February/046166.html

This patch will address the migration of old Security Groups being
modelled as Address Sets if the OVN schema supports the feature. This
migration will be performed from the OvnWorker which is holding a lock
on the IDL. This ensures that the migration happens from only one worker
in the cloud and after it's done, all the neutron-server instances are
ready to use Port Groups.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

The tempest utility that is configured here will take a snapshot.
After the snapashot and test run it will delete any resources that
are not in the snapshot.

If a tenant creates a resource outside of the test run it will also
be deleted.

This is something which is not desirable in a live lab.

This patch aims to provide control to the end-user to define how
to perform the final cleanup.

This is problematic for time sensitive tests such as this one

https://github.com/openstack/os-brick/blob/master/os_brick/tests/

where the thread can be interrupted prior to final time measurement.
This may cause the test to fail randomly. Therefore, we need to
run the tests with the concurrency of 1 to avoid these kinds of
unpredictable failures.

be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

This patch also fixes another error. When the pre migation VM is created, we
test it by running the command '/sbin/ip'. In some of the cirros images
the right path is '/bin/ip'. So change this to the comand 'date'.

This change temporarily disable some tempests tests until
bug 1789878 is fixed.

Note well: this is a cherry-pick with modifications.
On stable/queens, bug 1789878 prevents all scenarios
tests from succeeding, or at least reliably so. This
is why this change skips all scenario tests.

Using the etcd v3 api causes vault to suffer from bug
https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/4961. But v2 has its own
issues *1. This patch switches back to using the v3 api but disables
vault from perfomring TLS certificate checks against the etcd
cluster. Given that the charm deployed vault only uses etcd to store
a token for HA and that token is inturn encrypted by vault it does
not seem a significant security risk.

*1 As Dmitrii Shcherbakov noted, the vault documentation
expresses reservations about the v2 api:

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/storage/etcd.html
""the Etcd storage backend supports high availability. The v2 API has
known issues with HA support and should not be used in HA scenarios.""

Instead of using openstack-tox-cover template, run the cover job
in the check queue only as the template would do.

The release-notes-jobs-python3 template is setup already, remove
indvidual jobs - they are redundant.

Remove jobs that are part of the templates.

The repo defined both voting and non-voting openstack-lower-constraints
jobs, only use the non-voting one. Remove the extra jobs. Add comment
on why the job is non-voting.

Update requirements constraint for packages since neutron and horizon
require newer versions.

Remove openstack-tox-docs jobs with required-projects - the way the job
is setup in tox.ini together with doc/requirements.txt, we do not need
these.

We always run DB sync in deploy_tasks, ensuring that the database is
up to date. We should follow up with online data migrations
too.

Doing this via docker_config has 2 purposes:

* We can easily ensure this happens in a container with the right
  config files mounted.

* We can even apply this via a minor update. This is important because
  we'll have to backport this all the way to Pike and apply it there
  using Pike containers, before upgrading to Queens containers.

There's an additional issue to consider: In Puppet service variant we
ran the online migrations for release X before upgrading to X+1, but
the proposed Docker variant migrations for X run with upgrade to
X. This means that when switching from non-containerized to
containerized, we'll need to run migrations twice, to correctly switch
between the aforementioned approaches.

Also, we are seeing random CI failures due to concurrency. Stestr is
running in parallel by default. See

https://stestr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MANUAL.html#parallel-testing

This is problematic for time sensitive tests such as this one

https://github.com/openstack/os-brick/blob/master/os_brick/tests/
privileged/test_rootwrap.py#L101

where the thread can be interrupted prior to final time measurement.
This may cause the test to fail randomly. Therefore, we need to
run the tests with the concurrency of 1 to avoid these kinds of
unpredictable failures.

A race condition may occur when concurrent agent scheduling happens,
since neutron-server uses multiple child processes to handle the agent
scheduling requests simultaneously.

The idea is to add inter-process synchronization locks on the top-level
scheduling operations of DHCP servers and routers to ensure the
scheduling decisions of a resource are atomic.
