Training labs parser will allow us to automatically parse RST code
to BASH. This BASH code in turn will be invoked by install-guides for
validating the install guides. To provide the correct information to the
parser for generating BASH code, there are a few changes required to the
RST syntax.

Introduces the following changes to RST syntax:

  - `.. end`

    This tag provides information for the parser to stop extracting the
    given block which could be code, file injection or configuration
    file edit.

  - `.. endonly`

    This tag provides information for the parser with the correct
    distro-switch logic for identifying distro-specific code.

    For .. only:: tags, it is better to avoid nesting. If nesting
    is not avoidable then it is preferable to add the .. endonly
    tag to close the outer block immediately.

  - Extra new lines in code-blocks

    Some commands in the code-blocks provides the expected output of the
    given command. This is not a BASH command which we want to run but
    rather some visual niceness for the users. These new lines provides
    the parser information to identify the end of the command. This
    basic logic would be something similar to find '\r\n' which at least
    for python means new empty line.

  - `mysql>`

    Introducing this operator for mysql commands. This could potentially
    be changed to `pgsql>` or similar for other SQL type databases.
    This allows the parser to identify mysql commands and then run
    them in mysql instead of in 'sh' or 'bash'.

  - `.. path`

    Introducing this tag to provide the parser with the information with
    the path of the configuration file. Using the description text for
    the same is not reliable since the description text may not be
    consistent.

This commit should ideally introduce all the syntax changes required for
the parser to convert the code-blocks in here to BASH code. These
changes should have no impact on the HTML output of the RST code.

Turns out I7dae83667a1aca92c552fbfaa1e90c6558e293bf had a mistake and
was unconditionally converting RequestSpec o.vo to dictionary just
before sending it to the scheduler. This wasn't noticed as scheduler
manager has compatibility shim in place that converts the dictionary
back into o.vo when it's received.

The problem this produces is that we cannot drop the compatibility
shim from manager until 4.0 scheduler RPC API. This commit fixes that.

In commit 4df0869, a ClientRouter was added to cache client connections
to cell message queues. The periodic task for removing stale clients
is called with an empty RequestContext, but this overwrites the copy
in thread local storage unless overwrite=False is specified.

This adds overwrite=False to the empty RequestContext to prevent it
from overwriting the thread local context. All of the other periodic
tasks use get_admin_context() which also creates a RequestContext with
overwrite=False.

Before this change we checked the cluster for any failed actions and
we stopped the upgrade process if there were any.
This is likely eccessive as a failed action could have happened in the
past and the cluster is now fully functional.

Better to check if any of the resources are in Stopped state and break
the upgrade process if any of them are.

We also need to restrict this check to the bootstrap node because
otherwise the following might happen:
1) Bootstrap node does the check, it is successful and it starts
   the full HA -> HA NG migration which *will* create failed actions
   and will start stopping resources
2) If the check now starts on a non-bootstrap node while 1) is ongoing,
   it will find either failed actions or stopped resources so it will
   fail.

    manage_systemd_service start ""${service%%-clone}""
    check_resource_systemd ""${service%%-clone}"" started 600

""""""

The problem with the above code is that it is open to the following race
condition:
1) Bootstrap node is busy checking the galera status via cluster check
2) Non-bootstrap node has already reached: start_or_enable_service
   rabbitmq and later lines. These lines will be skipped because
   start_or_enable_service is a noop on non-bootstrap nodes and
   check_resource rabbitmq only checks that pcs status |grep rabbitmq
   returns true.
3) Non-bootstrap node can then reach the manage_systemd_service start
   and it will fail with stuff like:
  ""Job for openstack-nova-scheduler.service failed because the control
  process exited with error code. See \""systemctl status
  openstack-nova-scheduler.service\"" and \""journalctl -xe\"" for
  details.\n"" (because the db tables are not migrated yet)

This happens because 3) was started on non-bootstrap nodes before the
db-sync statements are complete on the bootstrap node. I did not feel
like changing the semantics of check_resource and remove the noop on
non-bootstrap nodes as other parts of the tree might rely on this
behaviour.

In preparation for moving the current code into a new file but retaining
the existing dynamic_inventory.py entry-point, this change modifies the
main function so that can generate inventory without having to be in the
same directory as the env.d dir.

An initial attempt to move the `main` function of dynamic_inventory into a
structure like this:

    playbooks/
        inventory/
            env.d/
                <env files>
            dynamic_inventory.py
            lib/
                generate.py (contents of dynamic_inventory moved here)

resulted in errors when trying to access env.d due to using
os.path.join(__file__) inside the function. Also, incorporating this
change with the move would have resulted in a harder-to-review patch.

Instead, the `args` function will be left inside of dynamic_inventory.py
when `main` is moved out, so that the CLI-facing code is grouped
together.

Since the base environment was moved to a command line argument,
documentation was added as to its function, as well as the differences
from the --config argument.

As a side effect, this opens the door to running tests with multiple
environment layouts. However, none is added with this review.

The previous behavior for main took an arbitrary dictionary and looked
for keys within it. To decouple the main function from the args
function, this change instead formalizes the names for the arguments
to main, allowing for documentation of the expectations.

Since Ansible's default expected argument is `--list` and that would
collide with the Python `list` builtin function, the `kwargs` argument
is added to act as a catch-all. In practice, while Ansible passes the
list argument in, it does not change the script's behavior.

EPEL is not required when deploying OpenStack with RDO repositories.
In fact, it's causing some packaging conflicts for some dependencies,
and having it installed might cause some deployment failures.

To avoid this situation, let's disable its setup by default to improve
our user experience but add a note about why we disable it by default.

This module is now needed to get access to firewall for bridged frames,
as well as to /proc/ settings that are used by Neutron to enforce
firewall for all bridges.

Since nova-network does not pass -m physdev to any of its iptables
rules as Neutron does, the module is not automatically loaded, leaving
the firewall ineffective. For Neutron, the module loading is triggered
by the first -m physdev rule applied, so in general case there is no
visible breakage.

Throughout much of the v3 authentication tests, you'd see calls
directly into the token_provider_api. While this was convenient
because the backends were loaded automatically, it makes changing
the implementation of the backend harder because we're relying on
it in the tests by coding to it directly, instead of just testing
the behavior through the API.

This commit makes it so that all calls to validate a token actually
use the token API instead of passing tokens directly to the
token_provider_api, exercising a request from the controller to the
backend... no cheat days here!

Recently in If6ff35e91c3d35c2741332c7e739bb92b1234c54 a refactor of the
authentication in Mistral client stopped it accepting *args and now it
only accepts **kwargs.

kwargs were always expected, but Python will allow you to implicitly
pass them based on the order, but as this was removed and now **kwargs
is in the method signature it wont work.

This is a regression in mistralclient.

In commit 4df0869, a ClientRouter was added to cache client connections
to cell message queues. The periodic task for removing stale clients
is called with an empty RequestContext, but this overwrites the copy
in thread local storage unless overwrite=False is specified.

This adds overwrite=False to the empty RequestContext to prevent it
from overwriting the thread local context. All of the other periodic
tasks use get_admin_context() which also creates a RequestContext with
overwrite=False.

Since we have changed the authentication of API endpoints in nailgun
(/api/version specifically) we cannot expect HTTP code 200 from nailgun
anymore. The functional tests install and run nailgun, checking whether
it is ready to serve request by quering the /api/version endpoint and
waiting for HTTP code 200. The commit changes this logic to accept any
return code except 000, since any valid HTTP return code shows that
nailgun is ready.

In the Nova scheduler, a lot of logs are produced per request which
are never looked at. We could cache these log records in memory and
only handle them if the overall request fails.

This patch provides a SpoolManager which you can set up for EG 'api'
requests. You can then ask it for a SpoolLogger, which will get a name
like ""spool.api.<request id>"". You pass this logger to the request
processor, from which it will cache log records, and if there is an
exception you call #flush on it. The log records will be released and
propagate up to the ""spool.api"" logger, then ""spool"", then the root
logger. Configure these with your logging config file as usual.

If flush is not called then the log records will be collected when the
last hard reference to the SpoolLogger is removed. If you're worried
about lingering logger references, you can call clear to wipe the
records once you know you no longer need them.

Please check carefully for race conditions and memory leaks.

It's common to pass an object (EG an instance) as part of a log
record, then mutate that object. This isn't a problem normally as the
log record has already been formatted and emitted but if we're going
to spool log records, this could lead to misleading logs.

Allow a 'freezer' function to be provided, either on the SpoolManager
or via the 'spooling' context manager. This function must return a
record which will not mutate. copy.deepcopy is a valid freezer
function. Optionally, it may also prune the record so it takes less
memory to spool, providing all the information required by the
formatter(s) is retained. If no function is supplied, the record must
not be mutated (nor any object it refers to).

The count of records is a poor measure of the amount of memory
consumed. I imagine operators would prefer to limit their spools to
say 10MB each, instead of say 1000 records and hope that each record
is under 10KB.

This patch adds a means of so limiting, using pymple's asizeof method
to recursively size the log record. This is done after freezing, which
gives projects a chance to cut out unnecessary information.

Victor identified on Ic58dafceefde1b109721a58631c223522bf4cc9c that
log filters are only applied by the logger they are added to. That is,
if you apply a filter to the root logger, it's only checked for
records that are sent directly to the root logger. It is not checked
for records that propagate there.

This patch adds a global filter, which is applied to every logger. You
can then add filters to the global filter, which will run on every
record, regardless of which logger they are sent to. Three stages of
filter are offered, with the suggestion that 'pre' and 'post' filters
are used to modify the record while 'mid' filters actually filter or
divert records.

When sourcing the Keystone RC file, some of the variable options are
conflicting, and may provide the wrong information to a token request.
For example, If both OS_USERNAME and OS_USER_ID are passed, the
Keystone Client has to chose which one to add to the token request,
and it might not be the one the user expects.  The same is true for
any value that can be passed both by name and ID. In addition, some
of the combinations lead to cryptic error messages.

To clearly identify the users intention, the old environment is
cleared of all variables that start with the `OS_` prefix
before setting any new variables.

This is a less invasive fix than the patch at
I8684370ff1ad9387d0e2f450ce483b22b613a3c7 but
it is more hacky because its just skipping
the dynamic address from an RA rather than
preventing it from being assigned in the first
place.

It may be safer to merge this for RC2 than the
other one.

Those VMs are not managed by Nova and is used for emulating hardware
servers for Ironic. In multinode topology those VMs are created on
all nodes primary and subnodes. This patch adds an extra vxlan tunnel
and new bridge br_ironic_vxlan to provide connectivity between VMs on
different nodes.

There are several tests where the expected output
relies on order of strings generated from the arbitrary
ordering of dictionaries or sets. The new version of
tox causes that ordering to be different between tests
runs so tests must be resilient and test either the
content of the dicts or sets or their sorted output.

Note: These fixes are only of those cases where a failure
was generated. If there are issues in skipped tests, this
patch has not found nor fixed them. The vast majority of
skipped tests are related to availability of functionality
so there's little that can be done about that with the
current testing setup. The best we can do is be on the
lookout for failures that could be related PYTHONHASHSEED
down the road and fix them as they happen.

 * Before we run the commands to test some functions in the Tricircle,
   we need to import the environment variables. So it is necessary to
   describe this file ""admin-openrc.sh"" more clearly before test.
 * When creating pod instances for Tricircle and bottom OpenStack,
   this document lack the instructions for the parameter ""token"".
 * Some volume actions tests lacked in this document.

2. What is the solution to the problem?

""token"". We also add some volume actions tests in this document.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to

Currently there are incompatible services to be deployed
in the overcloud i.e. opencontrail which have dependency
issues with the overcloud controller.

This submission creates a new role called TestBed to deploy
third party and custom services in the overcloud.

How to deploy:

Update the content of environments/testbed.yaml to add the
new services to be deployed/tested in this new role. Then
deploy an overcloud using this env file.

i.e.

openstack overcloud deploy \
--libvirt-type qemu \
--ntp-server pool.ntp.org \
--templates /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates \
-e /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates/overcloud-resource-registry-puppet.yaml \

In mitaka, update_access merged with a known concurrency issue.
This concurrency has been randomly failing in our CIs. This change
adds a lock mechanism to prevent that, while rules are being removed
by a thread, a parallel thread adds back or handle the same rules
that are being removed.

Also, a late mitaka update_access patch [1] broke share migration access
rules consistency, thus leaving stale access rule data on share server
that hosted the share prior to its migration. This patch addresses this
by preventing the refresh mechanism from adding back rules
that are removed.

Remove block_device_mapping preperty for os.nova.server profile
based on following reasons:
1) block_device_mapping_v2 property is more flexibility than
block_device_mapping property.
2) For nova server create api, block_device_mapping parameter
can't coexist with block_device_mapping_v2 parameter. So we
does't need to keep two types block device properties in our
os.nova.server profile.

control_service class expects to have only one heartbeat thread.
But the service launchs a heartbeat thread everytime when
control_bus.start() is called. Thus control_bus has 3 methods
and sends 3 heartbeat messages always.

This adds a barrier to stop creating extra heartbeat threads in the class.

The archive_deleted_rows command in nova-manage is often-broken and
not well tested by us. We can test it to some degree in functional tests,
but running it against a real database with real deleted stuff in it
is a good idea. This adds a post-test hook and runs the archive so that
after a full test run in the gate, we'll see the output. Later, we should
make a failed run of this fatal, but for now, just run it so we can see
how close we are to being able to gate on it.

I931421ea introduced a callback to _create_configdrive from
_create_domain during a rescue that recreates the config disk of an
instance with an additional .rescue suffix. However due to a latent bug
neither the original or this recreated config disk are mapped to the
instance during the resulting rescue.

To correct this disk.config.rescue is now added to the disk_mapping for
the instance if a config disk is required during a rescue.

This cleans up stdout/stderr leaking in cmd testing by using the
pattern of MonkeyPatching stdout/stderr to a StringIO object where
appropriate.

The OutputStreamCapture fixture was using in one place, but that
actually is just about moving the output to the subunit stream. That
output will eventually be dumped at the end of the runs. When we
really don't want that to happen, we need to capture it directly.

This adds the $LOAD_PATH manipulation needed to find openstacklib from
the nova base provider code.  When compiling a static catalog (puppet
master --compile), the puppet master doesn't populate the plugin
directory before hand.  That means that either openstacklib won't be
found at all, or may be an old mismatched version.  This code is copied
from the keystone module which has similar needs.

SafeConfigParser supports interpolation on top of ConfigParser in Python 2,
and SafeConfigParser is deprecated in Python 3.2 and log warning
like "" DeprecationWarning: The SafeConfigParser class has been renamed to
ConfigParser in Python 3.2. This alias will be removed in future versions.
Use ConfigParser directly instead.""
So we can use ConfigParser if we don't need interpolation.

Currently, the quark project does not have documentation, so
the repo lacks the structure to support it. This job has now
become a blocker for PR's to the project. Since it is a part
of the python-jobs template, remove that template. Re-add
needed gates, such as pep8 and python27.

Conditional update method from the persistent OVO class is blindly
relying on persistent OVOs having an OPTIONAl_FIELDS attribute without
defining a default.

This patch adds an empty default so we can do conditional updates on
persistent OVO instances that don't have optional fields.
