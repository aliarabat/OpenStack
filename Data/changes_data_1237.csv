Now Swift writes it's proxy-server-logs into syslog as well as swift-proxy.log.
This behaviour is to be changed after adding oslo.logging into Swift.
From the other hand, we use pipeline.setup_pipeline inside Swift. And all swift-logging configs
become applied to Ceilometer's pipeline. As a result (in case of DEBUG is on) we see too many
Ceilometr-related messages in syslog.

node_locked_retry_attempts variable to zero.

A new unit test is added to check that the retry will work after first
getting a NodeLocked exception, then succeeding getting the lock on the
next lock attempt.

The default conf file locator needed to reference the file another level up.

The config file set/write did not work if more than one option was changed.
I'm not sure why but think it would be better to just read once, set the
options, and write at the end anyway.

If we are updating and a service is there but not mentioned in the conf file,
we change the conf to True so should also add the service to the available

The bug is caused by consecutive client calls when
fetching users' roles in a project.

The fix was to use the /v3/role_assignments endpoint.
Which retrieves all roles in a single client call
(dashboards/admin/projects/workflows.py:
UpdateProjectGroupsAction and UpdateProjectUsersAction).

The compatibility to the previous keystoneclient version
is maintained.

In a scenario with 1000 users with a role in a project
(using devstack), the time to render the Modify Users

This is a POC for seeing the level of changes necessary for moving
the ResourceTracker in Scheduler with an interface.

The main issue is how the RT is accessing Driver methods, as it
needs to backport all driver calls to the computeManager and pass
the values in the parameters.

There are still some open questions, see the changes with the FIXME
and NOTE comments.

_reclaim_queued_deletes will only find instances in SOFT_DELETED
state and delete them if they are only old enough. The quotas will be
committed when the instance was soft-deleted so that resource can
be used right after the soft-delete operation.

There are some concern about the quota inconsistency for the operation,
The only case that the quota might be inconsistent is
the compute node died between set instance state to SOFT_DELETED
and quota commit to DB; when compute node start again
it will have no idea the reservation is committed or not or even
expired, since it's a rare case, so marked as todo.

There are some alternatives if the problem need to be fixed, e.g.
able to find reservation when nova compute restart, so we can double
check whether the quota is committed or not.

This is a fix for the issues encountered when a service is not
configured or a service endpoint is not reachable. This fix
will add tolerance for these errors so that an error message is
displayed but the dashboard page will still load, not an error page.
This makes it easier for the user to recover by allowing them to
go to a different page, select a different region, or logout. This
makes sense in many cases such as when a region only contains an
image service endpoint, or when a single endpoint is not reachable
for whatever reason.

It also adds permissions to the panels that require compute or
image services so that the dashboard will not display them if
the service is not configured.

To test these changes you will need to set up your keystone service
catalog so that not all services are available in all regions, or
some of the service endpoints are not reachable.

Two new pages added: Settings page and ChangePassword page.
To test their functionality I wrote two tests:
1. test_user_settings_change
 * changes the system's language
 * changes the timezone
 * changes the number of items per page (page size)
2. test_password_change:
   changes the password, verifies it was indeed changed and
   resets to default password.

To allow the above I've made few changes in other places:
* projectpage - added the go_to_settings_page method.
* helpers - added Selenium's implicit wait for self.driver
  in order to use page_timeout for pages that don't load
  instantly.

The get_num_instances method impl simply asks libvirt
how many running domains there are. This is flawed for
a number of reasons.

 - It doesn't filter out 'Domain-0' on Xen
 - It doesn't count inactive instances

As a result the value is returns is inconsistent with
the number of instances shown by 'list_instances'.
This will cause the _sync_power_states method in the
compute manager to constantly try to re-sync the list
of instances.

Remove the flawed impl and just allow the base class
default impl to be used. This just does a len() call
over the return of 'list_instances'. Previously this
was quite a heavy API call, but with new enough libvirt
it can be completed in a single API call which should
be fine.

Manila's test framework is pretty old and requires update.

Changes:
- usage of nose replaced with testr
- now all the tests are thread safe
- added new options for run_tests.sh, such as --concurrency, --debug, etc...
- new '--concurrency' option for run_tests.sh defaults to 1, examples:
    ./run_tests.sh  # will run in 1 thread
    ./run_tests.sh --concurrency 2  # will run tests in 2 threads
- added tools/colorizer.py for colorizing output of testrun with run_tests.sh
- tests running with tox use as much threads as cores available by default
- examples of testrun with tox:
    tox  # will run test suites defined with 'envlist' in tox.ini, now it is pep8,py26,py27
    tox -epy27  # amount of threads is equal to amount of cores
    tox -epy27 -- --concurrency=2  # amount of threads is 2
    tox -epy27 -- --concurrency=4  # amount of threads is 4
- Added 'Database' class to manila.test module, for more conveniant db testing
- updated policy file 'manila/tests/policy.json' to allow share-network actions
- removed nose-related requirements
- added new requirements for testrepository, subunit

With merge of this change all old installed virtual environments become
incompatible and should be removed with ""rm -rf .tox .venv"" before testrun.

I attempted to use this function and found a few problems.

We shouldn’t unlink the file after closing it, because someone else could lock
it in between.  Switch to unlink before close.

If someone else locked the file between our open and flock, they are likely to
unlink it out from underneath us.  Then we have a lock on a file that no longer
exists.  So stat the filename after locking to make sure the inode hasn't
changed or gone away.

We probably shouldn’t unlink the file if we time out waiting for a lock.  So
move that to before the finally block.

The nova.api.openstack.compute.images modules was using the
nova.image.glance module directly, instead of using the new,
standardized nova.image.API module.

This patch corrects that usage and updates the associated unit tests to
use mock instead of the nova.tests.api.fake.stub_out_glance() method.

Copies the nova.tests.api.fake._make_image_fixtures() call to a new
nova.tests.image_fixtures module, and corrects a number of errors in the
original function, including not returning datetime objects for
timestamp fields (as the nova.image.API returns) and ensuring that the
ID field is a string in the returned fixture dicts.

The _make_image_fixtures() function and the stub_out_glance() function
will be removed in the next patch, which fixes up the image_metadata
module, which is the last unit test that uses them.

This change adds the get_by_metadata_key function to the AggregateList object
and the aggregate_get_by_metadata_key function to the DB API.

Previously, the only DB API function available for finding aggregates matching
a metadata key returned a dictionary of aggregated metadata. The
aggregate_get_by_metadata_key function returns all rows matching the specified
metadata key, and is called by the existing aggregate_host_get_by_metadata_key
DB API function.

The get_by_metadata_key function returns a list of Aggregate objects matching
the specified metadata key.

Prior to this change our heat templates define one virtual IP, which all
the services are bound to.

We wish to be able to segregate these endpoints: some need to be
accessible to ""the public""; some are only intended to be accessed within
the cloud; some are only for admin use.

This change adds a second VIP which we can use for binding only the
endpoints that are intended to be publicly accessible, leaving the older
VIP to be used for internal end points.

Haproxy is told to also listen on that new VIP so that we can expose selected
services via the new VIP, and keepalived is in charge of assigning the VIP to
control plane nodes.

This change has a proposed split of services between control-only and
control+public interfaces. Assuming our yaml parsers (in merge.py and
Heat) understand YAML anchors/aliases, and assuming I've got the syntax
right, this should get expanded so that all the control+public services
get their config defined from the same block without needing to repeat
it for each service. (AFAICT both merge.py and heat use pyyaml, which
does support aliases/anchors)

The default is left at binding to only the controlplane interface, so
that new services added to this map will default to being internal-only

Attempt to force-delete a volume if the regular delete times out in the
hopes that forcing the delete will actually remove the volume rather
than leak it and cause other test runs to fail.

This is only changing the non-admin tests for now to see if it helps
with stability, but a longer term consideration should happen for
refactoring the regular volume delete client calls with defaulting to
force-delete if they timeout, then we don't need this try/except logic
in every volume API test doing this same tear down.

Due to an assumption that libvirt live migrations work only when both
instance path and disk data is shared between source and destination
hosts (e.g. libvirt instances directory is on NFS), instance disks are
removed from shared storage when instance path is not shared (e.g. Ceph
RBD backend is enabled).

Distinguish cases that require shared instance drive and shared libvirt
instance directory. Reflect the fact that RBD backed instances have
shared instance drive (and no shared libvirt instance directory) in the
relevant conditionals.

UpgradeImpact: Live migrations from or to a compute host running a
version of Nova pre-dating this commit are disabled in order to
eliminate possibility of data loss. Upgrade Nova on both the source and
the target node before attempting a live migration.

If an error occurs during `_create_domain`, we need to ensure that the guest's
FS is unmounted from the host in all cases.

This is necessary because, if we leave the FS mounted to the host, the
`lvremove` triggered by `delete` won't work because the filesystem will
'still be in use'.

The solution is to wrap the code in a `try/finally` to ensure the cleanup
routines (which unmount) are always called.

This borrows heavily from the compute notifications code. The basic
idea is that there are few classes of samples that can be had
(Fan, Temperature, Voltage, Current). Within these are potentially
multiple individual sensors and values. In all cases the volume and
unit of a sample can always be extracted from the value of a
'Sensor Reading' key. The volume is cast to a float. If the value
is 'Disabled' the data is dropped.

Each subclass exists to allow flexible handling via stevedore, but
all activity is performed in the superclass.

The supplied good test data is the currently blessed sample from the
Ironic team. The bad test data tickles either skipping missing data or
producing warnings in the log.

Identifier and name construction is worth a close look because this
is an area of frequent discussion:

* resource_id is composed from node_uuid and sensor id
* meter name is based on the class name and is generic, only
  paired with a resource_id does it identify a specific sensor
* unit is parsed out of sensor data and mapped to SI units

In some cases Neutron might send events such as 'VIF unplugged'
for instances which are either being deleted or shelved. When
that happens there will be a failure in dispatching the event
to the appropriate compute node - as there is no host for the
instance.

As multiple neutron events can be stashed in a single call
it is important to avoid that this kind of errors will prevent
processing of other events in the same call.

This patch does not process events for instances without a host,
marking them as failed.

When the above condition occurs, the create event request will
return a 207 response code. For specific events, a 422
unprocessable entity code will be set.

This patch also preserve the characteristic that events are
returned in the response in the same order they were found in
the request.

commit 7c6ea39940380738b4b969ed4c1b11e45ecd2055.

The oslo alpha releases are only published as wheels because we
don't want to expose them to icehouse users who may still be using
pip 1.3 which doesn't know to ignore alphas.

We recently switched to bandersnatch based pypi mirror to allow
us to mirror these wheels.

However, the py26 unit test jobs on centos6 are failing because
an old version of virtualenv and pip is installed. The failure looks
like:

  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement oslo.config>=1.4.0.0a2

Monty has been working on a fix, but it's proving to be a whack-a-mole
situation with each fix showing up yet another issue. Let's remove
the alphas for now so that the auto-proposing bot isn't proposing
changes which we know are going to fail.

To avoid creating additional user_creds entries for every nested
stack, pass in the parent/owner stack user_creds_id.  This means
updates will work with trust-scoped tokens, and will remove the
overhead of creating a new trust for every nested resource.

This will also avoid the potential situation where a stack has been
updated (adding nested stacks) by a user other than the original
stack owner - if that happened, it would be impossible to delete
the stacks (owner and nested) as any user other than an admin,
due to restrictions on who can delete the trust.

Note the delete logic is modified so nested stacks no longer delete
the user_creds ID.  If we stick with this simple logic, it will
mean it's necessary to either delete all stacks before upgrading
or do a manual DB query to clean up any orphaned user_creds rows
when existing nested stacks are deleted (such a cleanup is probably
already necessary due to the previous patch fixing user_creds
handling for backup stacks)

Also modifies the stub_keystoneclient test call to make stubbing
the client in the parser test easier.

ML2 provider networks partial specs let admins choose some provider
network attributes and let neutron choose remaining attributes. This
change provides the implementation for GRE/VXLAN provider networks.

In practice, for GRE/VXLAN provider networks provider:segmentation_id
choice can be delegated to neutron, in such case neutron will try to
find a network in tenant network pools which respects provided
provider attributes.

fixes the suffix problem.

Having all the console scripts in one file means that we always pull
in all the dependencies. This presents a problem in downstream packaging,
for example, a distro alarm subpackage required pymongo dependencies
installed, even if not used.

This patch separates the console scripts into a 'cmd' module, the
way Nova does it. Eventlet monkey patching is done in the module's
__init__.py file.

For access to Swift objects, Sahara should be changed to generate a
Keystone trust between the user with access to those objects and the
Sahara admin user. The trust would be established based on the user’s
membership in the project that contains the Swift objects. Using this
trust the Sahara user could generate authentication tokens to access the
Swift objects. When access is no longer needed the trust can be revoked
thus invalidating the tokens.

The Devstack commit 3317437caca5eb769ab4c6d3ea7c5d3e062517e2 removed
the osapi_compute_extensions configuration option from lib/nova.

This caused a bug of Climate 1312368, I think that we should not remove
default value of osapi_compute_extension from devstack in nova as this
value is a multiple string option. Once the default value is removed,
then when we add another value of osapi_compute_extension in nova.conf,
the default value of nova.api.openstack.compute.contrib.standard_extensions
will be overwritted and this will causes a lot of HTTP 404 at Nova API.

The glance/cmd/control.py file contains a possible shell injection
vulnerability:

https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/master/glance/cmd/control.py#L134 .

Setting 'shell=True' here opens the possibility of shell injection
by setting server to something like '; rm -rf /'. This will cause
the command 'rm -rf /' to be run with the privileges of the user
that ran Glance.

The fix is to parameterize the input so that the command run here

Refactored migration tests due to use OpportunisticTestCase, removed
unused code and ``test_migrations.conf`` file.

This change allows tests use database ``openstack_citest`` only
for connection to the database backend. The main feature of this
approach is - for each migration test will be created new database
with random name. This will avoid migration tests of race conditions
and reduce tests intersection.

``test_migrations.conf`` file was removed, because we create test
database for migration test, so we no longer need test database credentials.

The fix for memory leakage in the related bug added a check for plugin
deallocation that performed a call to gc.collect() after every test.
This had the side-effect of increasing test execution time by ~50%, so
this patch makes the check optional via an environment variable
(OS_CHECK_PLUGIN_DEALLOCATION).

It may make sense to create a periodic job that runs with the check
enabled, but otherwise the check can be used by developers for
debugging purposes.

The unit tests were previously consuming an excessive amount of memory
(4GB+) due to plugin instances persisting in memory.  Deallocation was
not possible where a combination of circular references and mocking
was involved.  This patch ensures that only NeutronManager holds a
plugin reference and that all other references are instances of
weakref.proxy.  Residual memory footprint for tox executed on a
12-core machine has been reduced to ~1.3GB.  Plugin deallocation is
validated at the end of each test to prevent regressions.

This change also includes fixes to unit tests that depended on plugin
instances persisting across tests.

To this aim this patch slightly alters the current validation

the same routine sets default values which avoid the

Currently the v2 functional tests are run without the v2 registry enabled.

This means that bugs which are only seen when the v2 registry is enabled
may not be caught by the gate (eg #1308419, #1339775).

Here we enable some basic functional testing (eg image life cycle) with
the v2 registry enabled (in addition to the existing direct-to-database
mode). This should help prevent some types of bugs being introduced.

There is a plan to move some functional tests into tempest, at which
point these additional tests can be removed in favour of equivalent
tempest tests.

This patch adds the 'raise_on_len_mismatch' parameter to the
'delete_nat_rules_by_match' function. The plugin then leverages
this parameter for ensuring NAT rules deletion operations
are completed successfully even when duplicate rules are found
or no corresponding rules are found at all.

With this change, the 'remove_router_interface' operation will
correctly complete even in cases when NAT rules in Neutron and
the NSX backend are out of sync.

This patch also changes a check in delete_nat_rules_by_match in
order to make it less expensive.

In the event of an unrecoverable hardware failure, support needs to
relocate an instance to another compute so it can be rebuilt.

The changes involved in this patch are:
  [*] Add a new v2 extension to determine that the host argument
      on evacuate is now optional.(Extended_evacuate_find_host)
  [*] Doc regeneration.

DocImpact: The evacuate target host is now optional.
If 'host' field is not sent in the request, the scheduler will
determine the target host.
This will include nova client changes ( on the proper commit ) to support
this new optional parameter.

Puppet is really handy for initial configuration of the environment,
however it's actually really poor at running stack.sh because you
don't get any output as you go. This instead moves that to the
shell provisioning tool to make for a better interactive experience.

Client already supports -H/--header option when creating container
or uploading objects. This patch extends this option to support
Storage Policy.

e.g.,
    swift post con -H 'X-Storage-Policy:p1'
This creates one container 'con' with storage policy 'p1'.

    swift upload con obj -H 'X-Storage-Policy:p2'
This creates container 'con' with storage policy 'p2' and uploads
object 'obj' into it.

Also fixes segmented uploading to non-default storage policy container

When uploading large objects with segmentation to container with
non-default storage policy, there will be another 'xxx_segments'
container created, but with the default storage policy. This
results all the segments to be stored with the wrong policy.

This patch is for the Storage Policy feature, and also
compatible with old versions w/o Storage Policy support.

keyring is conditionally imported if available on your platform,
however not all versions of keyring actually work. Specifically
we have global-requirements of >=2.1,!=3.3, so we know those are
the only versions we believe work.

If you are on an older platform, using system installed
python-keyring, python-keystoneclient won't install a new version,
because it's optional, but then will use a terriblely old verison,
which explodes with dbus errors.

The fix is to be more explicit on import.

Back in the day, attempting to install argparse on python 2.7 would
result in failure, as the setup.py of argparse failed hard if it was
attempted. That seems to be fixed, and when we do filter it out of
the list now, we cause problems with python 2.6 and wheels (if we make
a wheel on 2.6 and it depends on argparse, the pbr code means that
argparse doesn't get added properly)

Remove the filtering so that our wheels can be universal.

``keystone.token.core.validate_auth_info`` has been deprecated

-Autoscaling templates were updated
-Verification that second instance is loaded was changed
(before we counted common number of instances with F17 image and waited until
this number increase, but that's not correct, that's why now we count instances which
belong to test stack and wait for scale-up)

Currently the ""router"" dashboard does not have its unit tests
run by default. This was beacuse the dashboard needed to be
turned on for these tests to be run and turning on this dashboard
was not mandatory.

However, now that the dashboards are pluggable, turning on the
router dashboard tests, and more specifically the Cisco N1K profile
tests is doable and necessary. This fix aims to remove the checks
put in place to run the tests only when the dashboard is available
and instead now run all the tests mandatorily

NotImplementedError is the name of the exception
(https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html).

NotImplemented is the name of a constant
(https://docs.python.org/2/library/constants.html).

It makes no sense to raise a constant. The exception should
be raised instead.
