Neutron Metadta Agent and Nova Metadata API are responsible for
providing cloud init with networking config, but also for injecting
keys. Our Tempest gates were having those services disabled which
resulted in VMs not getting correct keypairs. This made them impossible
to SSH into from Tempest tests.

This commit solves it by adding q-meta and n-api-meta services to
Tempest gates.

This change set bases the extra_specs processing in
resources_from_flavor and resources_from_request_spec on the new
ResourceRequest class and its from_extra_specs factory method.

resources_from_flavor is used by consumers who assume the compute node
is the one and only resource provider, so here we fold all the resources
together, even if they're coming from multiple groupings in the
extra_specs.  This will have to be fixed as soon as we have anything
using nested or shared RPs.

resources_from_request_spec now produces a ResourceRequest object which
is passed directly into the scheduler's get_allocation_candidates
method.  However, get_allocation_candidates currently just extracts the
(unnumbered) 'resources' dict out, resulting in precisely the
pre-existing behavior.  Later in the series, when GET
/allocation_candidates is prepped to accept it, this will be changed to
process the whole dict into the query string for GET
/allocation_candidates.

_process_extra_specs is no longer used, and is removed.

Currently, our integrity checking for objects is pretty weak when it
comes to object metadata. If the extended attributes on a .data or
.meta file get corrupted in such a way that we can still unpickle it,
we don't have anything that detects that.

This could be especially bad with encrypted etags; if the encrypted
etag (X-Object-Sysmeta-Crypto-Etag or whatever it is) gets some bits
flipped, then we'll cheerfully decrypt the cipherjunk into plainjunk,
then send it to the client. Net effect is that the client sees a GET
response with an ETag that doesn't match the MD5 of the object *and*
Swift has no way of detecting and quarantining this object.

Note that, with an unencrypted object, if the ETag metadatum gets
mangled, then the object will be quarantined by the object server or
auditor, whichever notices first.

As part of this commit, I also ripped out some mocking of
getxattr/setxattr in tests. It appears to be there to allow unit tests
to run on systems where /tmp doesn't support xattrs. However, since
the mock is keyed off of inode number and inode numbers get re-used,
there's lots of leakage between different test runs. On a real FS,
unlinking a file and then creating a new one of the same name will
also reset the xattrs; this isn't the case with the mock.

The mock was pretty old; Ubuntu 12.04 and up all support xattrs in
/tmp, and recent Red Hat / CentOS releases do too. The xattr mock was
added in 2011; maybe it was to support Ubuntu Lucid Lynx?

Bonus: now you can pause a test with the debugger, inspect its files
in /tmp, and actually see the xattrs along with the data.

Since this patch now uses a real filesystem for testing filesystem
operations, tests are skipped if the underlying filesystem does not
support setting xattrs (eg tmpfs or more than 4k of xattrs on ext4).

References to ""/tmp"" have been replaced with calls to
tempfile.gettempdir(). This will allow setting the TMPDIR envvar in
test setup and getting an XFS filesystem instead of ext4 or tmpfs.

THIS PATCH SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGES TESTING ENVIRONMENTS

With this patch, every test environment will require TMPDIR to be
using a filesystem that supports at least 4k of extended attributes.
Neither ext4 nor tempfs support this. XFS is recommended.

So why all the SkipTests? Why not simply raise an error? We still need
the tests to run on the base image for OpenStack's CI system. Since
we were previously mocking out xattr, there wasn't a problem, but we
also weren't actually testing anything. This patch adds functionality
to validate xattr data, so we need to drop the mock.

`test.unit.skip_if_no_xattrs()` is also imported into `test.functional`
so that functional tests can import it from the functional test
namespace.

The related OpenStack CI infrastructure changes are made in
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/394600/.

Also make ironic_tempest_plugins/__init__.py an empty file so 'diff'

Remove the following files, so 'diff' will be correct:

On iSCSI connections, when we are making sure that there no links remain
like /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-* we make several calls to os.path.realpath
which normal behavior is:

- If file path doesn't exist, returns the same file path
- If file path exists, return the real path

But there is a third option, and that is when the file did exist but it
dissapear right when the  call to os.readlink in posixpath:_joinrealpath

   path, ok = _joinrealpath(path, os.readlink(newpath), seen)

Which ends up raising an exception such as:

   OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
            '/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-20024f40058540081'

And because of this exception the detach will fail when it shouldn't.

This patch adds includes the call to os.path.realpath within a
try...except clause to prevent this race condition from unexpectely
making the detach operation fail.

A change was done in puppet-ironic: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/457478/.
It breaks upgrades and minor updates, as it tries run ironic-dbsync as ""ironic""
user, while the existing logs are owned by root.

This change adds an upgrade task forcing the correct ownership.

Many, many patches have gone into the master branch to
enable the use of depends-on for role tests and to make

ensures that this functionality is now available for this

The primary benefit for doing this would be to make use

This patch is introducing the maintenance mechanism for the database
consistency work.

The mechanism uses futurist [0] for running the two periodic tasks:
``check_for_incosistencies`` and ``cleanup_old_locks``.

The ``check_for_incosistencies`` task will compare the
""ovn_revision_numbers"" table with the Neutron's ""standardattributes""
table and check if there's any difference between the revision numbers.
If there're incosistencies it will the try to get a lock on that object
(introduced on previous patches) and sync that resource with the latest
in neutron. A OVSDB lock is used for this task as well to guarantee that
only one check is running in the entirely cluster.

The ``cleanup_old_locks`` task just clean up the locking table removing
locks that haven't been acquired for a certain period of time
(defaulting to 10 minutes).

The maintenance mechanism runs on its own OVN worker [1] so the OVSDB
lock doesn't conflict with the OVSDB monitor one.

Currently in this patch, only the ``network`` resource is being
addressed to keep it small and easy to review. New resources will be
added on subsequently patches.

The ``update_network`` method in OVNClient was updated to make the
""original_network"" parameter optional. The reason is because at the time
we are sync'ing it with the lastest version in the neutron database the
maintenance task won't have the ""original_network"" at hand. To keep it
simple, if that parameter is not passed to the ""update_network"" method
the whole resource will be updated skipping any comparison between the
original and the new.

This patch creates a new database table called ""ovn_revision_numbers""
which is responsible for keeping track of the OVN's resources revision
numbers (to later be compared with the Neutron's standardattribute
table).

A RevisionManager mechanism was introduced and integrated with the
locking mechanism so the revision number can be bumped before the lock
is released (if no exception has been raised). It's also used to compare
the object's revision number with the number in the database so, old
conflicting changes can be discarded. The integration looks like:

  with db_lock.acquire(<UUID>, <Type>) as lock:
      lock.init_revision_manager(<Object>)
      <code>

OR

  with db_lock.acquire(<UUID>, <Type>) as lock:
      lock.init_revision_manager(<Object>)
      if lock.is_revision_older():
          # Discard change and don't bump the revision number
          lock.bump_revision = False
      	  return
      <code>

If the ""<code>"" executes successfully (no exception is raised) then the
revision number for that object will be bumped at the end of the context
manager execution body (before the lock is released).

The revision number is also being saved in the ""external_ids"" field
in OVSDB.

As the first line of this commit says, this patch is only covering the
networks resources, other resources will be added later.

This patch is introducing a new locking mechanism for basic atomicity
when dealing with conflicting requests trying to modify the same
resource.

The usage is quite straight forward, the resource UUID and type is passed
as a parameter to the acquire() method and when more than one acquire()
is invoked using the same resource UUID only 1 worker will acquire the
lock, the rest will wait. For example:

  with db_lock.acquire(<UUID>, <TYPE>):
      # protected

A TTL mechanism is also present, if for whatever reason a worker that
acquired a lock crashes mid-operation the lock will be broken by other
requests after a timeout. The timeout can be configured via the
[ovn]/db_lock_ttl configuration option.

The resources affected by this patch are:

 - ML2: Networks, Ports, Subnets, Security Groups and Security Group
 Rules.
 - L3: Routers, Router Interfaces and Floating IPs.

Trunk driver is not needed to be initialized when ""trunk""
service plugin is not enabled.
On production environments it's not possible to base on
""service_plugins"" config option on L2 agent's side so this
driver is initialized always.
It cause problems on fullstack tests becasue there is race
condition between different ovs agents which consumes events
from Openvswitch monitor.
On fullstack tests however we can assume that agent's and server's
config are in sync so trunk driver can be initialized only if
""trunk"" service plugin is enabled on server side.

There are a lot of different approaches to deploy OpenStack to your
environment. Namely Puppet, Chef, Helm, Juju, Fuel, TripleO, Kolla
and probably more. The designated OpenStack operators would benefit
from high-level decision help when and when not to chose openstack-
ansible. This does not imply that one project is ""better"" than the
others.
This change adds a few bullet points to the docs which might help
designated operators to make their decision, because switching that
decision when the OpenStack cloud is in production might not be that
easy.

The resource tracker's _remove_deleted_instances_allocations() assumes that
InstanceNotFound means that an instance was deleted. That's not quite accurate,
as we would also see that in the window between creating allocations and actually
creating the instance in the cell database. So, the code now will kill
allocations for those instances before they are created.

This change makes us look up the instance with read_deleted=yes, and if we find
it with deleted=True, then we do the allocation removal. This does mean that
someone running a full DB archive at the instant an instance is deleted in some
way that didn't result in allocation removal as well could leak those. However,
we can log that (unlikely) situation.

""'NoneType' object is not iterable"" in the RequestSpec.from_primitives
method and the reschedule fails.

This adds 'group_members' to the _to_legacy_group_info method to set
the key.

The overcloud deployment playbook consists of several plays. Facts
gathered in a single playbook persist between plays, but by default
each play gathers facts from involved nodes before applying any
roles/tasks. That resulted in gathering facts many times.

This commit changes the deployment playbook so that we gather facts
once at the beginning, and then reuse them for subsequent plays.

Also any_errors_fatal is added to make sure that when one host fails,
subsequent tasks aren't attempted on the other hosts either.

When deploying a composable HA overcloud with a database role split off
to separate nodes we could observe a deployment failure due to galera
never starting up properly.

The reason for this was that instead of having the firewall rules for
the galera bundle applied (i.e. those with the extra control-port for
the bundle), we would see the firewall rules for the BM galera service.
E.g. we would see the following on the host:

tripleo.mysql.firewall_rules: {
  104 mysql galera: {
    dport: [ 873, 3306, 4444, 4567, 4568, 9200 ]

Instead of the correct mysq bundle firewall rules:
tripleo.mysql.firewall_rules:
  104 mysql galera-bundle:
    dport: [ 873, 3123, 3306, 4444, 4567, 4568, 9200 ]

The reason for this is the following piece of code in
https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/blob/master/docker/services/pacemaker/clustercheck.yaml#L62:
...
  MysqlPuppetBase:
    type: ../../../puppet/services/pacemaker/database/mysql.yaml
    properties:
      EndpointMap: {get_param: EndpointMap}
      ServiceData: {get_param: ServiceData}
      ServiceNetMap: {get_param: ServiceNetMap}
      DefaultPasswords: {get_param: DefaultPasswords}
      RoleName: {get_param: RoleName}
      RoleParameters: {get_param: RoleParameters}

outputs:
  role_data:
    description: Containerized service clustercheck using composable services.
    value:
      service_name: clustercheck
      config_settings: {get_attr: [MysqlPuppetBase, role_data, config_settings]}
logging_source: {get_attr: [MysqlPuppetBase, role_data, logging_source]}
...

Depending on the ordering of the clustercheck service within the role
(before or after the mysql service), the above code will override the
tripleo.mysql.firewall_rules with the wrong rules because we derive from
puppet/services/... which contain the BM firewall rules.

Let's just switch to derive from the docker service so we do not risk
getting the wrong firewall rules during the map_merge.

Tested this change successfully on a composable HA with split-off DB
nodes.

The current network deletion code doesn't follow the sequence as the

(like the operations push and pop in a stack) to release related
resources.

it create network segment first,
then mechanism_manager.create_network_precommit.
In the network deletion function delete_network:
it send related deletion events of resources.NETWORK

mechanism_manager.delete_network_precommit was triggered,

After restarting neutron-openvswitch-agent, the tentant network
connection would be interrupted for a while.

The cause is that the flow is not added immediately in default table
(table=0) of br-tun to resubmit to the right tunneling table before
the flow is removed by cleanup_stale_flows for its stale cookie.

Solution:
Substituting rpc.call for rpc.cast in _notification_host to make
sure that the flow won't be removed by cleanup_stale_flows before
an fresh flow is installed.

UpgradeImpact
DocImpact: _notification_host in L2populationAgentNotifyAPI now
           is a blocking operation.

port_pair_group resource depends on port_pairs. As per current
implementation, it is assumed that list of port_pair(dict
representing port_pair) is present in port_pair_group dict,
under key ""port_pairs"". But list of port_pair ""id"" is received
from database. It causes dependency calculations to fail.

Currently, if a RPC timeout occurs during a AMQP call, a full
firewall sync is performed by L2/L3 agent.

Full sync process_services_sync actually works as bellow in V2:

1. get_projects_with_firewall_groups RPC call is sent
2. neutron server respond with ALL projects
3. for each projects (even if project is not schedule on this agent):
   _retrieve firewall rules using RPC call get_firewall_groups_for_project

This process is really inefficient, it will just flood a neutron server
process which is already fully busy (cf: RPC Timeout on the first call).

This patch return to get_projects_with_firewall_groups call
only projects with firewalls which are scheduled on this agent.

Currently get_firewalls[1] calls get_firewall_routers for each tenant
firewall which performs a db query to get firewall router-ids, we should
instead perform a unique db query to get router-ids for all firewalls

This change optimizes get_firewalls[1] implementation by calling once
the new method get_all_firewall_routers instead of calling many times

This adjusts the policy engine to support looking up fields
of related resources for the 'field' rule type. This re-uses
the same logic that was introduced for the 'tenant_id' rule
type to lookup the tenant_id on the parent network.

DocImpact: If an operator wants to make subnets on external
           networks visible for regular users, he/she can now
           adjust the policy.json policy on get_subnets to
           include the rule 'or rule:external'.

We plan to have all projects that integrate with Neutron use the same
alembic environment (Neutron's) instead of having a separate alembic
env.py in each repo. This means that each project will need to label
their contract and expand branches uniquely.

With this patch we add support for branch labels of the form
  'networking-foo-contract'
  'networking-foo-expand'

We also support the old labels ('contract' and 'expand') with the
intent of backporting this patch to Mitaka so that projects can be
backwards compatible when they update their alembic branch labels. A
best effort will be made to backport this patch to Liberty also.

Support has been removed for label names starting with a ""liberty_""
prefix. Such labels temporarily existed during the Liberty cycle but
have now all been cleaned up.

The test works as follows:
 - test process (T) spawns a child process (C), which is the service-like
   process with one worker (W1)
 - this means the C spawns the W1
 - T sends SIGHUP to C, which sends SIGTERM to W1, reloads configuration
   and spawns a new worker (W2)
 - every time worker is spawned, it writes to a file and T then checks
   correct amount of bytes inside

In case test is run with Python 3, we never see data from W2. I was able
to track it down to oslo.service project [1] that spawns a
greenthread in W1 when SIGTERM is received from C. In Python 3, it
takes up to a minute to start executing the new greenthread.

This patch is to prove increasing timeout fixes the issue. It doesn't
solve the root cause that is likely in eventlet or oslo.service.

NOTE: It doesn't fix the test_restart_wsgi_on_sighup_multiple_workers
      test.

iterators. We can use dict.items instead, as it will return iterators
in PY3 as well. And dict.items/keys will more readable.
2.In py2, the performance about list should be negligible, see the

This change introduces a new module, nova.api.openstack.placement.lib,
with a class RequestGroup, which is to be used both by the placement API
internally (when parsing the querystring to GET /allocation_candidates)
and nova (when parsing extra_specs and producing said querystring for
said API).

The decision to put this into a placement-specific package is
deliberate: when placement gets split out, this should go with it, so it
can be imported by any placement API consumer.  In the meantime, we
accept that it will feel a little weird for nova code to import from a
placement API package; but this should be the only module for which that
happens - i.e. any other ""shared"" classes/utils should go in this same
module.

If we specify block migration, but there are no disks which actually
require block migration we call libvirt's migrateToURI3() with
VIR_MIGRATE_NON_SHARED_INC in flags and an empty migrate_disks in
params. Libvirt interprets this to be the default block migration
behaviour of ""block migrate all writeable disks"". However,
migrate_disks may only be empty because we filtered attached volumes
out of it, in which case libvirt will block migrate attached volumes.
This is a data corruptor.

This change addresses the issue at the point we call migrateToURI3().
As we never want the default block migration behaviour, we can safely
remove the flag if the list of disks to migrate is empty.

upgrade test previously implemented. The job and pipeline
is defined in-repo to ensure that the keystone team has
complete control over the voting status, pipelines it is
in, etc.

The test uses the 'upgrade' tox environment in the
openstack/openstack-ansible-os_keystone repository which
executes a build of two keystone containers using the
the head of the stable branch of keystone, then upgrades
to the proposed review. The upgrade is a complete rolling
upgrade using MariaDB as a database.

As ingres traffic to instance ports when using DVR uses same matching
openflow rule as openvswitch firewall driver, it happens that setting
admin_state_up of router deletes firewall rules.

This patch makes the deletion more strict because DVR and ovs-firewall
flows differ in priority. Thus using priority when removing DVR flows
won't affect ovs-firewall flows.

Many, many patches have gone into the master branch to
enable the use of depends-on for role tests and to make
use of the git clones put into place by zuul. This patch
ensures that this functionality is now available for this
branch too.

The primary benefit for doing this would be to make use
of the cached git clones provided by zuul to improve test
reliability.

The secondary benefit would be to have the ability to
use depends-on to test patches together.

However, this will come at the cost of requiring a tox
configuration change, and the implementation of the
tests/tests-repo-clone.sh and run_tests.sh scripts
across all repositories.

Many, many patches have gone into the master branch to
enable the use of depends-on for role tests and to make
use of the git clones put into place by zuul. This patch
ensures that this functionality is now available for this
branch too.

The primary benefit for doing this would be to make use
of the cached git clones provided by zuul to improve test
reliability.

The secondary benefit would be to have the ability to
use depends-on to test patches together.

However, this will come at the cost of requiring a tox
configuration change, and the implementation of the
tests/tests-repo-clone.sh and run_tests.sh scripts
across all repositories.

Required repositories which do not have a newton branch
are removed from the job definition.

TripleO Relies on package promotions for jobs to run but can build the
puppet-* packages as necessary for depends-on changes. The shared
tripleo queue as well as the excessive amount of resources taken
by this job configuration no longer justifies the additional coverage
they provide.  The Puppet OpenStack team believes removing these jobs
to be in the best intrest of the community to reduce the impact on the
upstream infrastructure as we already have enough coverage between
the existing puppet-openstack-integration and beaker jobs.

Additionally as TripleO is moving to containers and hopes
to remove these existing baremetal jobs during the Queens cycle. While
the container versions of TripleO jobs still use puppet today, they do
so in a fashion that is not necessarily supported by the Puppet
OpenStack community.

If a plan has been updated (or deleted and re-created), we don't want to
show validation results from before the update.

This plan excludes validation results, so the validation statuses are up
to date.

This removes the remaining legacy tests relating to
openstack-ansible repositories including the cross-repo
tests which were implemented for keystone, nova-lxd
and ARA.

The 'openstack-ansible' repo tests (both on-commit and
periodic) are being replaced by [1]. The cross-repo
tests will be re-implemented in a subsequent patch to
each repository using [2] in a similar fashion to
[3].
