When dynamically introspecting components by type, use the component object
itself instead of its name as a string.  When comparing against a string, we
create bugs due to code mangling: component names get truncated to shorter names
to save space, and our equality checks don't work.  Comparing against the
component itself solves this problem without having to sacrifice mangling
altogether.

The value and meaning of the word ""meritocracy"" has been a source of
much debate in many communities, open source and otherwise. For many
people it is considered exclusionary and something of a hallmark for
not being in tune with its negative connotations. Rather than
presenting our defenses against those negative connotations and
being more explicit about the local definition of a subjective term,
we can remove it in favor of something that is more direct.

The intent, in the past, has been that ""meritocracy"" is supposed to
be indicative of a community where the people who get on and do
things and get stuff done are the ones that become become leaders.
The problem with this is ""meritocracy"" is defined by those who are
already in positions of leadership and thus implicitly excludes
those who may be leading or attempting to lead (or ""do"") in styles
that are different from existing leaders or who come from
backgrounds different from the norm. These styles may have just as
much ""merit"" as any other.

The change here simply states what is the case: one of the ways we
achieve openness is by technical governors being elected from
members of the community, rather than being imposed from elsewhere.

Also in this change ""technical leads"" is adjusted to ""team leads"" to
reflect the current expansion of ""PTL"".

While Tempest's own plugin documentation recommends that
plugins only consume tempest.lib [0], the BaseTestCase in
tempest.test is more feature-rich, comprehensive, and fault-tolerant
than the BaseTestCase in tempest.lib.

Many plugins like keystone_tempest_plugin already use the
BaseTestCase in tempest.test. Also, QA PTL said it would be
fine to make the transition when asked in IRC [1][2].

This commit specifically:
  - uses the base tempest class pattern specified in
    `tempest.test.BaseTestCase`: skip_checks for skipping tests based
    on environment config settings; setup_clients for instantiating
    clients and client managers; resource_setup for setting up
    class-level resources; and resource_cleanup for cleaning up
    class-level resources
  - removes unusued helpers like verify_nonempty, except in classes
    that explicitly already use it
  - removes clearing credentials in tearDown because the code isn't
    even executed due to a bug introduced by
    I51434685555c1da92401891a60285bf52571b8b5
  - separate admin clients from non-admin clients by using os_admin
    vs os_primary

Choi,ianychoi,"Publish translated guides with publishdocs tox job

This patch proposes to publish translated I18n contributor guide(s)
using publishdocs tox job.

It assumes that the URL structure of translated guides would follow
https://docs.openstack.org/developer/i18n/[language-code] scheme.

publishdocs tox job first executes docs job
which builds the original guide, then it executes build-docs.sh
build-docs.sh shell script which outputs
translated I18n contributor guide(s) into [language-code] directory
from current docs job output directory.
Then it copies to publish-docs/developer/i18n directory including
translated guide(s). The directory will be synced through
infra jenkins job which is implemented later.

Note that specifying locale directory in conf.py is needed
to enable sphinx-build execution with locale files.

Based on the user actions (i.e., a new IPv6 subnet is created in an
existing network, a second IPv6 subnet associated to the router etc)
when there is a change in the port[fixed_ips], the information is not
propogated to the ODL controller since n-odl driver is filtering the
fixed_ips element in the port_update event. This is creating issues
for various use-cases. This patch removes the filter and fixes the issue.

This commit modifies the upstream gate config in kuryr-k8s so it
disables swift. It specifically sets the enabled services and marks the
KURYR_K8S_API_PORT var so it can be easily identified and tweaked in the
future, as it was colliding with the swift-proxy port.

In addition, it triggers the all-projects for tempest so the kuryr-k8s

When an instance is being rebuilt, or shelved and unshelved,
the VM gets destroyed and recreated, keeping the same neutron port.

neutron-ovs-agent doesn't tear down the port, and doesn't notify
the HyperVSecurityGroupsDriver that the switch port has been recreated
in any way, which will cause issues when adding the security group rules;
most notably, the default reject rules and the previously existing
security group rules wouldn't be added.

This patch pops the _sec_group_rules and _security_ports caches before
reraising the os_win.exceptions.NotFound exception, after which
neutron-ovs-agent will retry the port binding.

This issue doesn't affect the neutron-hyperv-agent, which notifies the
HyperVSecurityGroupsDriver when a port gets removed, updating its

When an instance is being rebuilt, or shelved and unshelved,
the VM gets destroyed and recreated, keeping the same neutron port.

neutron-ovs-agent doesn't tear down the port, and doesn't notify
the HyperVSecurityGroupsDriver that the switch port has been recreated
in any way, which will cause issues when adding the security group rules;
most notably, the default reject rules and the previously existing
security group rules wouldn't be added.

This patch pops the _sec_group_rules and _security_ports caches before
reraising the os_win.exceptions.NotFound exception, after which
neutron-ovs-agent will retry the port binding.

This issue doesn't affect the neutron-hyperv-agent, which notifies the
HyperVSecurityGroupsDriver when a port gets removed, updating its
caches accordingly.

The main improvement comes from using the Influxdb Line Protocol. The
encoding methods in line_utils.py are like the ones used in the influxdb
client but optimized for our data

Additional improvement comes from avoiding calls to encode('utf8') as
the influxdb client already does that.

On my test system, these changes increased the number of measurements
processed from about 2200/second to about 3700/second. Measurement
processing time is now dominated by Kafka. Approximately, 35% of time
is spent reading from Kafka and approximately 22% of time is committing
offsets. Only 10% of the time is spent writing to Influxdb. About 30% of
the time is spent converting messages from the json string read from
Kafka into the Line Protocol format for Influxdb.

Once monasca-common is modified to use the faster kafka library,
performance should be even better.

I did try using ujson, but my tests showed it wasn't any faster than
the json package.

Another problem is regarding the commit
d0c961a99f570ec1973bf5540ba9237b6720c848 from OVS that removed the
run, log, and db directories as part of the normal `make install`
process. These directories were expected to be in place, so this patch
is manually creating them before the DevStack module for networking-ovn
tries to set some permissions on them.

This moves the jobs that download images over the internet into a
separate -nv job.  We will work on getting the base images mirrored in
a similar fashion to how devstack does it, but it will take some time.

Now that nodepool has moved to Xenial builders, I think we can drop
the trusty-based testing.  I will follow-up on that shortly to reduce
the jobs here in the medium term.

This service allows configuring and deploying cinder-backup
containers in a HA overcloud managed by pacemaker.

The containers are managed and run by pacemaker. Pacemaker runs the
standard Kolla image but overrides the initial command so that
it explicitely calls cinder-backup. This way, we shield ourselves
from any unexpected future change in Kolla.
This container needs to use the 'docker_config' section to invoke
puppet (as opposed to 'docker_puppet_tasks'), because due to the HA
composability each resource creation needs to happen on the bootstrap
node of that service and 'docker_puppet_tasks' will only run on the
controller/primary role.

The pypi package 'docker-py' [1] has been renamed to 'docker' [2].
It is better to move to the new 'docker' package because the old
package will be deprecated and all the new features will go into
the new package only.

Package 'docker' has been added to requirements [3]. The old
package 'docker-py' is still allowed to be in the global requirements
during the transition period but it should be removed after all or
most of the projects finsih the migration.

With the latest iSCSI disconnect refactoring [1] we have introduced a
regression where not all devices are properly cleaned up on a multipath
connection if we are using target discovery.

On connection we do the discovery so we get the targets, but on
disconnection  the code is expecting to have all the ips, iqns, and luns
information on the connection properties, so it will only flush the
multipath and disconnect volumes that were connected using the
information from the connection property.

This patch fixes this retrieving the targets information from the
discoverydb that was gathered during the connection phase.

Output from discoverydb query looks like this:

A run_once task decides on a host without the
context of conditionals related to the task.
The filter is done prior to evaluating any
conditionals.

Also, only the neutron-server neutron.conf has
the database connection credentials as a
security measure, so it is not able to execute
the database migrations.

This patch ensures that the database migrations
are only run once, but are also executed
wherever neutron-server is. It also adds
multiple instances of neutron-server and
neutron-agents to better test against problems
of this nature happening again.

Additionally, the patch uses the handlers for
the offline migrations to ensure that

1. What is the problem
In the patch[1] for solving bug[2], we introduce an error that when
a fip is created with port ID and the bottom port is not there, the
fip body is not returned. Our smoke test doesn't find out this error
because it only affects the response, the fip is correctly created
in the database. But the log does show an error message.

2. What is the solution for the problem
Always return fip body. Unit test is modified to use the returned
body to ensure it's not None.

3. What features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to
realize the solution
N/A

Our drivers have already supported FC and iSCSI protocols.
Our drivers have two storage interfaces, named HORCM and SNM2.
Our drivers have already supported three kinds of pattern on our code,
HORCMFC and HORCMISCSI, SNM2FC and SNM2ISCSI.

This patch tries the following:
(1) refactor base libraries.
(2) refactor existing drivers based on libraries change.

Because these drivers commonly use our code, I found that it is
hard to maintain the present code. So I refactor our code drastically.

The new relationship of our code are following:
1. The most upper classes are HBSDFC and HBSDISCSI. These classes
   inherit VolumeDriver class. These classes have HBSDCOMMON.
2. HBSDCOMMON class has common methods with HORCM and SNM2.
3. HBSDHORCM and HBSDSNM2 classes inherit HBSDCOMMON.
   HBSDHORCM class has the characteristic methods for HORCM interface.
   HBSDSNM2 class has the characteristic methods for SNM2 interface.
4. HBSDHORCMFC and HBSDHORCMISCSI class inherit HBSDHORCM.
   These classes have characteristic interfaces respectively.

In some unit and functional tests self.assertTrue(False) was used
instead of self.fail(), which might be against readability.

Using assertTrue(False) gives the following message on fail:

  File ""C:\Python361\lib\unittest\case.py"", line 678, in assertTrue
    raise self.failureException(msg)
    AssertionError: False is not true

After replacing assertTrue(False) with fail():

  File ""C:\Python361\lib\unittest\case.py"", line 666, in fail
    raise self.failureException(msg)
    AssertionError: None

Although the results are the same (both tests failed), the
message 'False is not true' is unnecessary, and can be omitted
from the log by using fail().

group, serialised to ensure that:

1. The services are changed in the right order.
2. The API services remain available at all times during
   an upgrade (except when doing a db contract).
3. If services are sharing a host/container then the
   role execution will not execute twice on the same

Use admin creds for waiting for all RBAC tests that use waiters after
rbac_utils has switched to RBAC role. It is not necessary (though not
detrimental either) to do this during tearDown.

The reason why this should be done is because ""waiting"" entails calling
a ""show"" API action in a loop, until the resource reaches a desired
status. In other words, a policy action related to the ""show"" API action
is enforced -- which is problematic within the context of RBAC testing.

Add a NFS protocol helper class that can modify exports of a Ganesha
server based on share access rule changes. This allows the manila
guests to access shares in CephFS backend using NFS protocol through
NFS-Ganesha gateways.

And while adding the driver's helper class that subclasses Ganesha
library's GaneshaNASHelper2 identified minor issues in the
Ganesha library. Fix the issues by:

* escaping special character '=' in values of Ganesha conf's string
  options, except for option CLIENTS, by enclosing the values with
  double quotes.

* add a new callback interface to GaneshaNASHelper class to
  allow driver's to perform Ganesha FSAL specific cleanup.

The policy.json file is currently read continually by the
services and is not only read on service start. We therefore
cannot template directly to the file read by the service
(if the service is already running) because the new policies
may not be valid until the service restarts. This is
particularly important during a major upgrade. We therefore
only put the policy file in place after the service restart.

tasks to simplify them and reduce the tasks/code a little.

which executes the cinder deployment in a play per host

1. The services are changed in the right order.
2. The services remain available at all times during

3. Online data migrations are actioned once all versions

The current rolling upgrade implementation
relies on the role to orchestrate the rolling
upgrade. When the role is executed using
playbook serialisation, the db sync contract
is executed before all hosts are upgraded,
potentially resulting in data corruption.

This patch returns the role to the simpler,
best practice model of expecting that the role
is applied to a single host and that the
playbook handles orchestration. This method
can be used with any form of serialisation.

The rolling upgrade test is currently not setting
the endpoint correctly due to 'keystone_upgrade'
not being defined.

This patch removes the requirement to define the
var by ensuring that the role always uses haproxy.
This prevents having to remember to set the var
when doing development and makes better sense for
test purposes anyway.

This patch also serialises the upgrade and ensures
that the backend is set into maintenance mode when
the upgrade is actioned.

When a playbook runs os_keystone in serial, the
SSH and fernet key distribution are broken. This
fixes both items allowing the role to be run in a
serialized playbook.

An upcoming microversion in the os-hypervisors API is going to
return the compute node uuid value for the id field in the
REST API response, which means that links for paging are going
to be uuids.

This change updates the compute node paging code in the HostAPI
to handle a uuid marker by finding which cell that compute node
is in and then starts the page from there using our existing
DB APIs which page using id markers within the cell.

A set of functional tests is added to show how this works against
actual cell databases.

Note that nothing is changed for the cells v1 HostAPI since paging
compute nodes (added in microversion 2.33) is not supported for
cells v1.

Currently when multiple services share a host, the
restart order is random. This is due to an unordered
dict being used to facilitate the mapping of services
to their groups, names and other options.

Based on [1], this patch implements changes to the role
to ensure that services on the same host are restarted
in the correct order when the software/config changes.

This patch simply replaces the scheduler's use of GET
/resource_providers?resources=XXX with GET
/allocation_candidates?resources=XXX. The provider_summaries part of
the returned HTTP response is used to generate the UUIDs that winnow
the number of compute nodes retrieved by the filter scheduler during
scheduling.

Following patches will add in support for actually doing the claim from
the scheduler against one or more resources providers by examining the
allocation_requests part of the HTTP response and picking one that
contains the host the scheduler picked during it's _schedule() loop.

Galera clustering support. These packages are different compared to the
CentOS7 and Ubuntu ones so the way the cluster is being bootstrapped is
also different. The systemd service file can't be used for that, so we
need to modify the MariaDB configuration file on the boostrap node to
initiate the cluster. Moreover, files are installed in different places
so we need to modify the distribution files and templates to take that
into consideration as well.

the two tasks are split and tagged appropriately.

The policy.json file is currently read continually by the
services and is not only read on service start. We therefore
cannot template directly to the file read by the service
(if the service is already running) because the new policies
may not be valid until the service restarts. This is
particularly important during a major upgrade. We therefore
only put the policy file in place after the service restart.

This patch also tidies up the handlers and some of the install
tasks to simplify them and reduce the tasks/code a little.

'with_*' does not work as expected when running tasks on remote hosts.
The reason for that is that 'with_fileglob' runs on the host running the
play instead of the remote one. It's very likely that the ssh keys
obtained from the running host will not exist on the remote one and
the following failure could be observed:

First, the example package install command neglected to include any of
the package names, so this patch adds the correct package names as well
as omits the non-essential, personal-preference command flags so as to
be consistent with the examples in the main OpenStack install guide.

Second, like the barbican packages in RDO, the OBS barbican packages do
not include an openstack-barbican-api systemd unit file and instead
provide an Apache vhost sample file, so this patch modifies the service
instructions to configure the service with Apache.

This patch adds the basic framework for registering and using

a module in barbican/common/policies/, and then added to the
list in barbican/common/policies/__init__.py.

Also adds tox env to generate policy sample file.

let's use this function instead of generic assertEqual() function.
This change makes the code and the error messages to be more readable.
