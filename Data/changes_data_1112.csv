The volume is cloned while creating it from another volume, snapshot

vCenter CloneVM_Task API.

So when a clone happens across clusters in a vCenter clone fails.
This patch fixes the problem by setting the target resource pool
(returned by datastore selection logic) while invoking clone.

This seems to be reproducible using Django 1.6.1 in local devstack.
The issue seems to be that Django's implementation of the add filter
has an issue concatenating a string and a function to localize text.
Since that fails and returns an empty string which subsequently is
added to the closing </em> tag, the closing tag is the only thing
that is displayed.

This fix saves the localized value to a variable which is then used

We currently upload logs and images to swift in two ways.
- Using the python swift client directly to upload logs
- Using a stand alone python script which is called from our bash
  scripts to upload images.

We need to consolidate these two so we have a common place for our
swift integration code which supports the following

- Upload and download objects.
- Check object size to make sure we are under the 5GB swift
  constraint.
- Retry logic
- Delete objects

I'm also changing the swift client code to always create a
non cached client. This is required for our upload\download
retry mechanism to work properly.

Problem:
We want to ensure that only one assembly is in a READY state
for an app. This is to ensure that Solum does not keep around
more heat stacks than are necessary. If there are more than one
assemblies then there are that many number of heat stacks,
which we want to avoid.

So the solution that we came up with is to delete other
READY assemblies when a new assembly has become READY.

However, this solution as is currently implemented
has concurrency issues in the situation when there are multiple
deployers in the system. In our testing we have seen both of
the following:
(a) when two assembly create are triggered in quick succession both
    are deleted
(b) when two assembly creates are triggered in quick succession
    none is deleted

This patch fixes the concurrency issue to ensure that both the
above situations don't arise.

The fix for (a) is to use the 'created_at' timestamp when deleting
assemblies. The idea is to delete all the READY assemblies which
have created_at timestamp which is smaller than the newly created
assemblies' timestamp. The reason this is correct is because there
will be only one READY assembly which will have the highest created_at
timestamp (because we are using a single database). So this assembly
will end up deleting other assemblies which are READY and have a
smaller (more recent) created_at timestamp.

The fix for (b) is to perform the database writes to update an
assembly's status in a synchronous manner in the deployer itself.
Current code performs this update in an asynchronous manner via the
conductor. In a multiple deployer scenario this asynchronicity causes
race conditions which leads to situations like (b).

The metering forms were using the date picker functionality from the
d3 line chart library, this used to work when it was loaded as a whole
page as the d3 libary would run intending to setup any d3 graphs however
now it is being loaded as a modal the elements that would be affected by
the d3 code do not exist at page load time.

In order to get the date picker events to be added to the elements on
the form when the modal loads, the JS in the forms template has been
extended in this patch to support adding those events.

This patch also changes the data attributes on the form elements so that
they do not conflict with any d3 line chart elements.

Alongside the javascript this patch fixes bug to do with parsing the
dates in metering utils and adds UTs to prevent regression.

As part of BP multiple IPv6 prefixes, we can have multiple IPv6 prefixes on
router internal ports. Patch, I7d4e8194815e626f1cfa267f77a3f2475fdfa3d1, adds
the necessary support for a legacy router.

For an HA router, instead of configuring the addresses on the router internal
ports we should be updating the keepalived config file and let keepalived
configure the addresses depending on the state of the router.

Following are the observations with the current code for an HA router.
1. IPv6 addresses are configured on the router internal ports (i.e., qr-xxx)
   irrespective of the state of the router. As the same IP is configured on multiple
   ports you will notice dadfailed status on the ports.
2. Keepalived configuration is not updated with the new IPv6 addresses.

This patch addresses the above issues for an HA Router.

Presently, the wsgi server allows persist connections hence even after
the response is sent to the client, it doesn't close the client socket
connection.
Because of this problem, the green thread is not released back to the pool.

In order to close the client socket connection explicitly after the
response is sent and read successfully by the client, you simply have to
set keepalive to False when you create a wsgi server.

Icehouse backport note: socket_timeout was dropped, it was introduced
in 0.14[*] and Icehouse eventlet lower bound is 0.13

[*] https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/commit/7d4916f01462de09cb58853d9de2e85777c2ad5b

Note: The required unit-tests are manually added to the below path,
as new path for unit-tests is not present in stable/icehouse release.
nova/tests/test_wsgi.py

DocImpact:
Added wsgi_keep_alive option (default=True).

The pbr setup_hook has not been needed for a while, so remove it.  The
neutron hook has been broken for a while: it places a setup_requires
build dependency on everything in neutron/__init__.py, which is
non-empty, but setup_requires is handled by easy install so we try
very hard to avoid it. Instead, we can use environment markers to
selectively include the win32 dependencies without requiring that
neutron be importable during setup.py execution. This is unusual
in OpenStack and will eventually be moved to a regular
requirements.txt dependency with the same marker - once we've finished
the integration work to make markers work properly in
requirements.txt.

Adds a potential usage of the post-deploy hooks to register a server
with RHN or a satellite.

Note this requires some additional parameters, which can be specified in
environment_rhel_reg.yaml, and this must be passed into the call to heat
via another -e parameter.  An alternative may be to have a global
extraconfig_env.yaml at the top level, which the scripts always pass, or
to use the global environment (/etc/heat/environment.d/default.yaml) on

This is needed because Nova commands are hitting the same
problem Cinder was hitting in bug 1368527 which was fixed
by this strutils update in bug 1366189.

This is not needed in kilo because in kilo Nova has moved
to using the oslo.utils library, which has this fix in it.

NOTE(jecarey):
This is now needed in stable/icehouse because of the backport of:
   f58d95c9 - Sync process and str utils from oslo
which was to address CVE-2014-7231 (bug #1345233)

Note that during icehouse mask_password was moved from
oslo-incubator log.py to strutils.py, however both still exist and
are used.  In order to minimize change, this patch also updates
the original nova/openstack/common/log.py.

Rewrite Fedora image example. The latest Fedora 21 comes with dedicated for
cloud usage images. These images provide a base system dedicated for use in
public and private cloud environments. These are cloud-init enabled striped
versions of Fedora. Prior to version 21, to cloudify Fedora images, it was
necessary to perform full manual installation outside of OpenStack, perform
specific configuration and manually cloud-init installation. New Fedora Cloud
images do not require any additional modification and are ready to use. Old
complicated procedure for F20 become irrelevant for F21.

The deprecated directive `run_pause` should be replaced with the more
standard one `interval`. The `run_pause` should be still supported for
backward compatibility. This patch updates object replicator to use
`interval` and support `run_pause`. It also updates its sample config

Prior to having jsonschema validate incoming requests for Keystone,
there were several different ways to validate input from the user. The
keystone/clean.py module was one of the ways this was done.

From a Keystone V3 perspective, we handle all validation with jsonschema
at the controller layer. With keystone/clean.py, these calls are
scattered throughout the Keystone stack, some in the backends, and some
in the managers, for the Keystone v2.0 API. This commit is an attempt to
standardize a place for keystone/clean.py calls in general, if and only
if we need them, since they are only for v2.0 calls.

Filtering criterion in the method of ""Query.filter_by()"" or
""Query.filter()"" introduced by SQLAlchemy supports to join
multiple criteria together instead of join each criteria
separately.

The motivation to make this change includes,
1. The docstring in the SQLAlchemy tell us the usage,
"" Multiple criteria are joined together by AND::

   session.query(MyClass).\\
      filter(MyClass.name == 'some name', MyClass.id > 5)""

or
"" Multiple criteria are joined together by AND::

   session.query(MyClass).\\
      filter_by(name = 'some name', id = 5)
""

Since SQLAlchemy provides this interface, this should has
its benefit from introducing this method, the direct impact
is we needn't build the query statement repetitively.

2. The change make the code looks more concise.

Removed use of contextlib.nested call from codebase, as it has been
deprecated since Python 2.7.

There are also known issues with contextlib.nested that were addressed
by the native support for multiple ""with"" variables. For instance, if
the first object is created but the second one throws an exception,
the first object's __exit__ is never called. For more information see
https://docs.python.org/2/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.nested
contextlib.nested is also not compatible with Python 3.

Multi-patch set for easier chunks. This one addresses the tests from
neutron/tests/unit/db directory.

Line continuation markers (e.g. '\') had to be used or syntax
errors were thrown. While using parentheses is the preferred way
for multiple line statements, but in case of long with statements
backslashes are acceptable.

The get_routers method in the l3 RPC code has a log.debug

JSON. This method can be expensive if there are hundreds
of routers being synced and it happens even if debugging
is disabled since the function call result is the parameter
to the debug statement.

callable and its args and defers calling it until the __str__ method
is called on it when it's actually trying to be rendered to a string.

They are some missing/extra indentations in tests source code. This
results in variables used out their scope (which remains unnoticed as
long as `with` contexts do not fail), and prevent refactoring scripts

performing well.

This simple patch fixes these indentation errors.

Currently lioadm helper creates portals with fixed IP addresses 0.0.0.0
and ::0 and also uses fixed standard port 3260 instead of using store
configuration (iscsi_ip_address, iscsi_secondary_ip_addresses,
iscsi_port) from the configuration as it should.

This could lead to problems if a different port was defined in the
configuration as the target would be available only on 3260 and other
services would look for it at configured port.

With this fix we now create the right portals with the right port.

Since now we pass list of ips and port to helpers cxt helper has also
been updated to use these parameters instead of going directly to the
configuration.

The old way was more efficient if there were few dimensions on
the metric and lots of Alarm Definitions with different
dimension sets for a given tenant id and metric name, but that
is probably unlikely. The more common case will be one or two
alarm definitions per tenant id and metric name and more
dimensions on the metric. The new algorithm is faster for that
case since it doesn't create every possible combinations of

Commit 3e42c7ae3f7a9353834c8c9c4dc79ee39dd0783b changed where the Hyper-V
VM configuration files are stored. The files are being stored in the same
folder as the instance. Performing a cold resize / migration will cause a
os.rename call on the instance's folder, which fails as long as there are
configuration files used by Hyper-V in that folder, thus resulting in a
failed migration and the instance ending up in ERROR state.

Hyper-V configuration files are stored in a subfolder of the instance's
folder (e.g.: C:\OpenStack\Instances\instance-000000b6\Virtual Machines).

This commit makes sure that Hyper-V configuration files are not being
moved during migration by skipping subfolders in the instance's folder.

change expands the vote range to include +/-2 but gives no one
permission to vote at those levels.  This should cause Code-Review
votes to appear as +/-1, while the NoOp function continues to
mean that +2 votes are not necessary.

Also extend the Council-Vote to +2, but similarly give no permissions
to use it so that council votes will appear as +1, -1, or red-x in
the case of a -2 veto (the -1/green-check dichotomy would also
seem weird for similar reasons).

Common SAIO setups have multiple ""servers"" all on the same host with
different ports for the different ""servers"" (which happen to match the
IPs specified in the rings for the devices on each of those ""servers"").

This breaks down if you want to set up the SAIO to have one
object-server per disk.

However, you can configure the SAIO to have different localhost IP
addresses (e.g. 127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2, etc.) in the ring and in the
servers' config files' bind_ip setting.

This new whataremyips() implementation combined with a little plumbing
allows is_local_device() to accurately answer, even on an SAIO.

In the default case (an unspecified bind_ip defaults to '0.0.0.0') as
well as an explict ""bind to everything"" like '0.0.0.0' or '::',
whataremyips() behaves as it always has, returning all IP addresses for
the server.

Also updated probe tests to handle each ""server"" in the SAIO having a
unique IP address.

Add a TC-Vote label and allow TC members to vote -1..+1 on this
label.  This will allow the formal tallying of TC member votes.
It is also not required (by Gerrit) since the actual rules are
complicated and no one thinks implementing them in prolog is
a good idea.  So we will simply rely on the chair to tally the

As part of Scheduler refactoring, we are planning to move all the data
request_specs dict to NovaObjects. This effort is about solidifying the
external interfaces of the scheduler component, in hopes of moving it
out of the Nova project.

This patch can be seen as a small step in that direction, for the
purpose of using a more object like interface in the scheduler code
(mostly filters at this point).

As a basic example: We have a need to detect if the request sent to the
scheduler related to an instance attempts to change the flavor. We add
this functionality as a method on an object that wraps the request_spec
dictionary, that we can now use in filter code to make decisions.

With this we get to iterate over the objects API while punting the work
of actually changing the RPC API to use new objects to a later series,
while avoiding the need to add messy functionality as utility methods that
deal with request_spec dictionaries that are on their way out.

This patch dumps pretty_tox.sh and gets Cinder on board
with using ostestr.  We're setting a concurrency value
of 6 (instances in the gate are 6 VCPU's), and things
seem to be stable at this value.

For folks running on 'smaller' system, it's still possible
to run in parallell > ncpu's but if there are problems you
can still specify concurrency in your tox argument.  Tox will
take the last occurence of the conncurrency argument; so for
example if you specify ""tox -epy27 -- --concurrency=4"" the
interpretted value for concurrency in the run will be 4.

Changes to instance.system_metadata weren't properly being saved
to the DB. The change to 'network_allocated' would be written to
the DB but not updated on the instance object. When the network
was cleaned up before a reschedule, the object would not notice
network_allocated' getting set to False, and not write the change
to the DB. After the reschedule, the instance would still have
'network_allocated' set to True, and skip allocating a network.
The node would go active with no network.

Since this is happening in the _allocate_network_async greenthread,
the solution is not to save in the async thread. The main thread
and the async thread share a reference to the same object and the
main thread waits for the async thread to finish before the final
save, so saving is unnecessary. I added comments on the
instance.save() calls that were part of the race so they don't get
removed or changed and reintroduce this bug.

Also, update the relevant test from mox to mock.

Removed use of contextlib.nested call from codebase, as it has been
deprecated since Python 2.7.

There are also known issues with contextlib.nested that were addressed
by the native support for multiple ""with"" variables. For instance, if
the first object is created but the second one throws an exception,
the first object's __exit__ is never called. For more information see
https://docs.python.org/2/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.nested
contextlib.nested is also not compatible with Python 3.

Multi-patch set for easier chunks. This one addresses the tests from
neutron/tests/unit/api directory.

Line continuation markers (e.g. '\') had to be used or syntax
errors were thrown. While using parentheses is the preferred way
for multiple line statements, but in case of long with statements
backslashes are acceptable.

The get_routers method in the l3 RPC code has a log.debug

JSON. This method can be expensive if there are hundreds
of routers being synced and it happens even if debugging
is disabled since the function call result is the parameter
to the debug statement.

This patch adds and leverages a small helper class that takes a
callable and its args and defers calling it until the __str__ method
is called on it when it's actually trying to be rendered to a string.

The way we were forming our iptables rules was not matching
the output of iptables-save. This caused the logic that preserves
counters to miss many of the rules.

This patch corrects the order for the comments and the allowed address
pairs to match the output order of iptables-save.

The Receiver._ensure_flush() method in ssync_receiver.py has
the following comment:

    Sends a blank line sufficient to flush buffers.

    This is to ensure Eventlet versions that don't support
    eventlet.minimum_write_chunk_size will send any previous data
    buffered.

    If https://bitbucket.org/eventlet/eventlet/pull-request/37

The reference pull request was included with eventlet 0.14 [1] and
swift now requires >=0.16.1 so it is safe to remove _ensure_flush()
and save > 8k bytes per SSYNC response.

The ssync Receiver performs some checks on request parameters
in initialize_request() before starting the exchange of missing
hashes and updates e.g. the destination device must be available;
the policy must be valid. Currently if any of these checks fails
then the receiver just closes the connection, so the Sender gets
no useful response code and noise is generated in logs by httplib
and wsgi Exceptions.

This change moves the request parameter checks to the Receiver
constructor so that the HTTPExceptions raised are actually sent
as responses. (The 'connection close' exception handling still
applies once the 'missing_check' and 'updates' handshakes are in
progress.)

Moving initialize_request() revealed the following lurking bug:
 * initialize_request() sets
       req.environ['eventlet.minimum_write_chunk_size'] = 0
 * this was previously ineffective because the Response environ
   had already been copied from Request environ before this value
   was set, so the Response never used the value :/
 * Now that it is effective (a good thing) it causes the empty string
   yielded by the receiver when there are no missing hashes in
   missing_checks() to be sent to the sender immediately. This makes
   the Sender.readline() think there has been an early disconnect
   and raise an Exception (a bad thing), as revealed by
   test/unit/obj/test_ssync_sender.py:TestSsync.test_nothing_to_sync

The fix for this is to simply make the receiver skip sending the empty
string if there are no missing object_hashes.

This reserved aggregate filter only allows certain tenants to use hosts in
an aggregate that has been marked for their use. If a request has the
scheduler hint 'reserved_pool' the host will be selected if it is marked
with the tenant's id. If the hint is not present the host will not be
selected if it is marked with any tenant id, including the one in the
request. This has will allow tenants to have reserved hosts to use for a
specific purpose. The tenant may chose to put an instance in their
reserved pool or not - hence the hint.

Nova-compute never recovers from this state unless manually

from happening, we make the compute node configuration happen after

py34 job was intended for unit tests only. It's important to distinguish
between different types of tests, because they all have different
requirements to execution environment. E.g. functional tests are not
expected to run in a restricted env designed for unit tests, and that's
even more valid for fullstack tests.

Otherwise, the job may fail or apply irrecoverable changes to test
runner system, breaking the system.

If we ever want to support py3 for other types of tests, we should add
separate jobs just for that.

Note that the neutron-python3 blueprint was not intended to introduce
changes to support anything but unit test execution with the new Python
version, so strictly speaking, any effort to make other test types work
is out of scope.

Since we're dropping Python 2.6 support, we can rely on stdlib's json
and get rid of our dependency on simplejson.

This lets us get rid of some redundant Unicode encoding. Before, we
would take the container-listing response off the wire,
JSON-deserialize it (str -> unicode), then pass each of several fields
from each entry to get_valid_utf8_str(), which would encode it,
(unicode -> str), decode it (str -> unicode), and then encode it again
(unicode -> str) for good measure.

The net effect was that each object's name would, in the proxy server,
go str -> unicode -> str -> unicode -> str.

By replacing simplejson with stdlib json, we get a guarantee that each
container-listing entry's name, hash, content_type, and last_modified
are unicodes, so we can stop worrying about them being valid UTF-8 or
not. This takes an encode and decode out of the path, so we just have
str -> unicode -> str. While it'd be ideal to avoid this, the first
transform (str -> unicode) happens when we decode the
container-listing response body (json.loads()), so there's no way out.

sys v init scripts are inherently racy since creating a PID file takes
a while. In particular collectived needs about 0.6 seconds to daemonize
itself and create its PID file. If the service gets restarted in this
interval the second instance of the daemon gets started without stopping
the previous one. Apparently mcollectived gets restarted very often during
the final phase of IBP. Hence get rid of sys V init script and use
upstart job to manage mcollectived.

This reverts commit ed799e38fe740621776aab51c95ec1db248af997.

Due to an introduced a regression[1]:
In case where neutron was configured to have more than one DHCP agent per
network (dhcp_agents_per_network<=2), dnsmasq rejects leases of others
dnsmasq instances. Some clients do not check server-id for those NAKs,
failing to set an address.

The reverted commit originally came to fix the issue[2] with DHCPNAKs sent
after neutron-dhcp-agent restart. This issue is expected to be fixed by a
separate patch[3].

As agreed on the summit I'm renaming the python modules
and doing some adjustments:
* This is a breaking change, so version is bumped to 2.0.0
* Used this chance to split conf options over proper sections
* RELEASES.rst is gone; it's too hard to keep it up-to-date;
  anyway git does better job at doing history
* Dropped deprecated option ports_for_inactive_interfaces
* Dropped old /v1/discover endpoint and associated client call
* No longer set on_discovery and newly_discovered in Node.extra
  (deprecated since 1.0.0, superseded by the get status API)
* Default firewall chain name is ""ironic-inspector"" and
  is configurable

Notes:
* Some links will be updated after real move.
* Stable branches will probably use the old name.
* Some usage of discovery word is left in context of
  ""discovered data""
* DIB element will probably be deprecated, so leaving it
  alone for now.
* Some usages of word ""discovery"" in the README will be updated
  later to make this patch a bit smaller
* Ramdisk code will be moved to IPA, so not touching it too much

Due to an introduced a regression[1]:
In case where neutron was configured to have more than one DHCP agent per
network (dhcp_agents_per_network<=2), dnsmasq rejects leases of others
dnsmasq instances. Some clients do not check server-id for those NAKs,
failing to set an address.
The reverted commit originally came to fix the issue[2] with DHCPNAKs sent
after neutron-dhcp-agent restart. This issue is expected to be fixed by a
separate patch[3].

also have the api-metadata recipe in the run list by default which
also tries to start the api-metadata service. This can cause timing
issues with the starting service.

This patch will remove the metadata value from the enabled_apis
attribute, and put out a warning if it's included.  The api-metadata
receipe should be used to control this service.  By default the
api-metadata recipe is included in the os-compute-api role which
is included in the os-compute-single-controller role. So, in most cases
it's already included in the run list.

Containers share many features in common with Nova instances. For the common
features, virt drivers for Nova can be used to surface basic instance
functionality. For features that go beyond what can be naturally fit within
a virt driver, we propose a new API service that allows for advanced features
to be added without conflating the worlds of instances and containers.

When trusted filter (nova/nova/scheduler/filters/trusted_filter.py)

method _do_request() in AttestationService class has this line:

action_url = ""https://%s:%d%s/%s"" % (self.host,
self.port, self.api_url, action_url)

It is easy to see that default type of attestation_port is string.
But in action_url self.port is required as integer (%d).
It leads to conflict.

This change provides more tests than is required only to cover this bug
fix. This cases are testing AttestationService _do_request() method
using different status_codes and different texts returned by mocked
request method.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

The .seconds attribute of a timedetla object cannot be taken in
isolation because it can overflow into days. For example, a -1 second
difference will become -1 day and 86399 seconds.

This became a problem when the agent clock was slightly ahead of
the server clock. When calling (server_time - agent_time).seconds
in this scenario, it would go below 0 in the daily seconds and
wraparound to 86399 seconds and -1 day.

This patch corrects the issue by using a method in timeutils that
ends up calling total_seconds(), which was designed for this usecase.
It also restores the formatting that was removed in patch:

Previously, we had urllib3 (via requests) automatically decode all
responses with a Content-Encoding of deflate or gzip. This included
object downloads, which would in turn cause etag or content-length
mismatch errors. (See bug 1338464)

This was apparently added in response to a third-party proxy sitting
between the client and server which, having observed that the client
would accept gzip-encoded content while the server sent an unencoded
response, would perform the compression. (See bug 1282861)

Now, we'll no longer let requests send any default headers, nor do any
decoding.

The retype command will always attempt a call
to the driver.retype method.  In *most* cases this
will hit the default impl which returns False because
most drivers don't implement any retype (most, a few do).

The problem is that the drivers that do implement this in
most cases will iterate through the settings and just make
the changes that are valid and ignore the rest, and then
return True. I think this is ""ok"" for the drivers to do,
drivers should be allowed to be somewhat dumb WRT Cinder
state management and placement info.  If we give them an
invalid command (which we're doing here) then it's on us
higher up the chain IMO.

The result is that for example if you're trying to retype
from backend-a to backend-b and backend-a implements retype
it can return True telling the manager that the volume was
succesfully retyped, even when it wasn't.

There's a lot of confusion around this bug, YES the
filter scheduler is used to determine if the retype is
valid and to what host.  That's not the issue, the issue
is that regardless of the source and destination host settings
that are provided from the filter-scheduler, we always make the
call to the driver, introducing the opportunity for a false
success status being reported back.

This patch adds a very simple check between the source and
destination host settings as provided by the scheduler and in
the case that the two are ""different""(not including pool designations)
we skip calling the driver.retype method altogether and fall through
to the migrate process.

This introduces a new hosts_are_equivalent method in
cinder.volume.utils
