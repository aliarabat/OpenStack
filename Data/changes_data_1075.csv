This patch changes the glance_image provider to use
puppet-openstacklib's authentication methods, which use
python-openstackclient as an interface, instead of the glance command
line client. The benefits of this is:

- Code reduction. This patch reduces the amount of code in the
  glance parent provider and glance_image provider by reusing code from
  Puppet::Provider::Openstack instead of implementing authentication,
  retries, and response parsing in the provider.
- Presumed reduction in sudden API changes that require quick fixes in
  this module, such as f377c0229c006b02f43a14be4979553e983cb98e.
- Ability to set project-based access control for images

Additional reasoning for this change is in the blueprint.

Important note: this change does not work on Ubuntu under Juno due to a
major bug in the version of python-openstackclient shipped in UCA [1].
This change targets the Kilo releases.

Note about performance: the self.instances and instances methods make
API requests for each image found in the list of instances. This is not
a change from how this was implemented before. The --long formatted
list, either from the glance client or openstackclient, does not
provide all information needed to query an instance and populate
setters. Future patches could possibly improve on this.

Other details of this change:

- Removes auth_glance method, replaced by the request and
  glance_request methods
- Removes auth_glance_stdin method which was not being used
- Removes parse_table which is now unnecessary because openstackclient
  formats its responses as CSV and Puppet::Provider::Openstack#request
  returns the results a hash
- Removes remove_warnings methods which are handled by
  Puppet::Provider::Openstack#request
- Removes list_glance_images and get_glance_image_attr which are
  sufficiently replaced by using the 'list' and 'show' commands with
  Puppet::Provider::Openstack's request method.
- Removed self.prefetch since we can't populate auth parameters during
  a prefetch. Instead we prepopulate the list via the instances method.
- Added a flush method to do updates more efficiently
- Changed is_public property to accept true/false in addition to yes/no
  and to munge to a symbol instead of a capitalized string, for
  consistency with keystone_tenant's enabled property
- Move the reset method into the spec tests since it is only necessary
  for testing
- Added tests for glance_image, which did not exist before
- Removed connection retry test since this is taken care of in
  openstacklib

This could be used to cache the pid of long running tasks associated
with an instance and then clear the cache when the process completes.
While the tasks are running should it be required the pid retrieved and
the process can be signaled.

test_relationships() should be testing the versions of subobjects held
in obj_relationships to the current versions of the subobjects. A static
tree was used to maintain the current versions before, and that static
tree was checked against the current version of subobjects. This is now
changed over to have a tree with the current version of the subobjects,
and a tree with the version held in the most recent entry in
obj_relationships within the object.

Because some versioning got stale, objects needed
to be updated to contain the correct versions of subobjects.

The following patch fixes field.Object's from_primitive()
to call a given object's obj_from_primitive() instead of
VersionedObject's obj_from_primitive().  By using the given
object instead of VersionedObject, the appropriate
OBJ_PROJECT_NAMESPACE is passed down to obj_from_primitive(),
and allows support for other projects namespaces.

Calling host.has_min_version triggers opening of a new
libvirt connection. This should not ever be done in the
constructor of LibvirtDriver class, as the 'host_init'
method must be allowed to run first during normal Nova
compute service startup.

This mistake was introduced in

  commit 9a09674220a071e51fdca7911b52c0027c01ff64
  Author: Vladik Romanovsky <vromanso@redhat.com>

    libvirt: enable virtio-net multiqueue

and is thought to also be causing instability in the
unit tests in the gate.

Avoid the problem by passing the Host object instance
into the VIF driver get_config method, instead of
trying to pass a flag into its constructor.

according to the Fernet specification, Fernet creates and encodes the token

timestamp, generated in a single place, versus returning a timestamp that we
create on to creation but changes when the token is validated because Fernet

* Created a 'resources' subdir and moved all fixture files

* Neutron process logs were using H:M:S format as their file name,
  but when starting multiple agents of the same type my machine
  was fast enough to do that in the same second so that different
  processes were outputting to the same log file. No good!
  Added ms to the log name format. I also changed the log time
  from UTC to local timezone.
* Renamed and moved 'FullstackFixture' to neutron/tests/fullstack/
  resources/environment.Environment
* Added a 'Host' abstraction that groups agents that report with
  the same 'host' value. Hosts may be interconnected by the
  environment via shared bridges.
* The 'Environment' class will accept global
  attributes (This will be later filled with stuff like tunneling,
  l2pop or other environment-level flags), and in this patch accepts
  a  list of host attributes (Configuration that may differ between
  hosts like the l3 agent mode [legacy, dvr, dvr_snat]).
* Made OVS agent and L3 agent fixtures expose their bridges
  so that I could interconnect them.
* Added a super simple L3 HA test to show that this entire thing
  works.

This patch allows the swift-proxy pipeline to be adjusted via a variable
""swift_middleware_list"", which can be amended to add additional
middleware as required.

The default remains the same - which is to include the default pipeline
when using keystone.

Additionally the logic around whether ""authtoken"" or ""tempauth"" are
enabled was changed to check if these are set in ""swift_middleware_list""
without requiring a separate variable. Variable ""swift_authtoken_active""
was removed as it is no longer required.

Tempest object storage settings were adjusted to work with the default
list of enabled discoverable_apis for object storage. Container syncing
was also turned into a variable based on the object storage default.

Before available releases were hardcoded in fuel_package_updates script.
Now they are obtained from API so there is no need to keep this list in the
code.
Releases created in Fuel < 6.1 are filtered out.

Changes:
 * get releases from API
 * added option to list available releases
 * use py.test instead of nose
 * explicitly require unittest2 (before it was requirement for nose2)
 * use httpretty to mock HTTP request (after moving to requests should be
   replaced with requests_mock)
 * added utils module with method to extract fuel version from release version
 * added test utils for mocking stdout and stderr
 * added BaseCliTestCase
 * made cli testing possible (main accepts list of args from cli)

W/o this patch, puppet sends notification
to Service['ceph'] unconditionally. As a
result, Service['ceph'] is being restarted,
followed by all deployed OSD restart on the
entire node.

This is a problem since all the related
Ceph OSD services has been already started
by `ceph deploy osd activate` and this notify
with restart only creates huge load
(especially in cases when OSD is added to
long-existing cluster under the load) and may
lead to unstable errors when particular OSD
services fail to start.

The solution is to trigger ceph service restart
only on configuration updates.

As described in the comments, sfdisk was rewritten for util-linux 2.26
(as shipped in F22) and now interprets arguments a sectors, rather
than cylinders.

The current partitioning line is ""1 - - *"" (start/size/type/bootable)
which means you start getting:

---
/usr/sbin/grub2-install: warning: this msdos-style partition label has
no post-MBR gap; embedding won't be possible.

/usr/sbin/grub2-install: warning: Embedding is not possible.  GRUB can
only be installed in this setup by using blocklists.  However,
blocklists are UNRELIABLE and their use is discoura ged..

/usr/sbin/grub2-install: error: will not proceed with blocklists.
---

when building images, because the start is interpreted by the new
sfdisk as sector 1 and it crams the partition right next to the MBR.

Specifying ""-"" for the size is undefined in the man page; even reading
the source it's not totally clear what ""-"" for the size does [2].  In
any case, the alignment is wrong in sectors or cylinders; we want to
be a multiple of 4KiB for best performance.

The intent here is to create one single, Linux, bootable, partition
taking up the whole disk starting at 1MiB, so ""2048 + L *"" makes this
clear.

We use the -uS argument to ensure both versions treat this start-value
as a sector offset (newer sfdisk essentially ignores the argument).
As described in the comments, bugs in the older sfdisk necessitate
usage of ""--force"".

Although we could choose more or less, it seems most common to align
to a 1MiB boundary (i.e. starting at sector 2048).  libguestfs has
some disucssion around --alignment and where it sets it's default to
this [3].  The 2.26-era sfdisk also defaults to putting partitions
here.  1MiB should be enough for GPT schemes in the future as well.

copy console log and cover report to swift os-loganalyze and apache will
serve up the mod autoindex generated index that only shows the console

is only on swift and not on disk.

We can ensure that the cover report always shows up in the index by not

The Kilo dynamic inventory script assumes a different data structure for
the inventory JSON than what Juno produces. This can lead to a number of
problems, the most prevalent of which has been duplicated IP addresses
for containers created during a Kilo upgrade (particularly repo
servers).

Rather than force the dynamic inventory script to account for multiple
structures, this script instead attempts to pre-process the inventory,
so that values are retained and the data format is not mixed.

When a Connection is first __init__ialized (without providing a
preauthurl or preauthtoken), the url and token attributes are None; they
get set (to be reused on future requests) after one of the wrapper
methods internally using _retry (head_account, get_container,
put_object, and similar friends) is called. However, this had not been
the case for get_auth, much to the momentary confusion and
disappointment of programmers using swiftclient who expected to be able
to get the token or storage URL off the Connection object after calling
get_auth (perhaps in order to make an unusual kind of request that
swiftclient doesn't already have a function for). This commit makes
get_auth set the url and token attributes as one might expect.

Even with OS-Brick being used to support different volume types in
Nova, there still needs to be a small shim layer to actually connect
to the different volume types.

This patch includes three very minor patches to enable this:

1) Because os-brick is a library and not an application, the rootwrap
for Nova needs to include the required CLI commands to attach/detach
volumes as it can't live in os-brick's repository.

2) libvirt_volume_types needs to include the new
HGST=>LibvirtHGSTVolumeDriver mapping, because os-brick doesn't
support discovery of supported types.

3) A small shim LibvirtHGSTVolumeDriver calling the os-brick library
needs to be added, again because there is no generic way presently
for os-brick to map to specific volume types in libvirtvolumetype.

This helps to solve a bug that is occuring as a side effect involving
unit tests; however, the problem is that .pop() is called on a dict
without first checking to ensure the value is there.  This is probably
due to another underlying assumption, but in this context doing the
safe thing both makes sense and solves the problem.

We don't currently support running the keystone admin endpoint
behind ssl (see _create_keystone_endpoint, which can only register
public endpoints as ssl), so it doesn't make sense to try to connect
to the admin endpoint via ssl.

For v3, this should be fixed at some point in the future, but in the
meantime let's get the code into a consistent state so it's usable
with public ssl endpoints.  According to the inline comments, the
v2 endpoint is never available via ssl anyway so this is actually
the correct behavior there anyway.

  - Networks provider extended attributes

This patch adds it to all the tables. These sections
refer to the same ENTITYs, so fixing the ENTITYs
fixes all the sections. Having said that, I don't think
it's a good idea that all list, create, show, and update
operations use the same ENTITY, which is ""networkListParameters""
since that makes it harder to maintain the file. I split
the ENTITY for each method individually, introducing a
common ENTITY that other ENTITYs can refer to.

This patch includes the DB, IPAM & RPC changes needed for the IPv6 Prefix
Delegation feature.

To enable this feature, the subnetpool_id attribute of subnets has been
modified to allow for a special subnetpool identifier - ""prefix_delegation"".

WORKFLOW:

1. Admin sets default_ipv6_subnet_pool in neutron.conf to ""prefix_delegation""
2. User creates a new IPv6 subnet without a CIDR or subnetpool ID
3. User creates an interface between this subnet and a router with an existing
external interface

The agent-side changes will follow in separate patches.

A documentation patch is up for review here:

https://review.openstack.org/#/c/178739

Video guides for configuring and using this feature are available on
YouTube:

Servers may be in various states of disrepair such as permanent subsystem
failure (fan failure), temporarily degraded (too hot), etc.

these conditions, account for these conditions in a systematic way,

A means to add code to interface between Nova's hypervisor drivers
and Neutron's forwarding drivers by external parties.  This allows
Nova to discover code that implements new VIF types that future
drivers require, recognising that they may wish to perform
various actions in the pursuit of attaching a VIF to a port and
will in some circumstances want to use a new hypervisor
configuration.

It addresses both the use case where the hypervisor config changes
and the existing cases where other network elements must be
created to make the plug happen.  It also recognises that it is
gluing two components together and the code selected must align with
the needs of Nova (hypervisor driver and the driver's version) and
Neutron (the binding_type that Neutron is proposing).

Now that samples always go over the messaging bus before being
potentially supplied to the transformers, there is a possibility
that samples can arrive out of time order. When this happens a
negative time delta could happen, causing a negative number where
one makes no sense.

This change adjusts handling such that if a sample if older than the
sample in the cache it is dropped and the cache is reset to have the
most recent sample. A dropped sample is logged with a warning as we
assume that violations of the order of time are something we might
want to be aware of.

If the samples are the exact same age, we carry on.

In case of a heat autoscaling stack decide to delete an instance,
the gnocchi metrics associated to this instance will be no more
updated and when the alarm will ask for the aggregation, gnocchi
will raise a 'No overlap' exception.
So temporary set 'percent_of_overlap' to 0 to disable the
gnocchi checks about missing points.

And adds some docs about the importance of filter out resource

* Neutron process logs were using H:M:S format as their file name,

  was fast enough to do that in the same second so that different

  Added ms to the log name format. I also changed the log time
  from UTC to local timezone.
* Renamed and moved 'FullstackFixture' to neutron/tests/fullstack/

* Added a 'Host' abstraction that groups agents that report with
  the same 'host' value. Hosts may be interconnected by the
  environment via shared bridges.
* The 'Environment' class will accept global
  attributes (This will be later filled with stuff like tunneling,
  l2pop or other environment-level flags), and in this patch accepts
  a  list of host attributes (Configuration that may differ between
  hosts like the l3 agent mode [legacy, dvr, dvr_snat]).
* Made OVS agent and L3 agent fixtures expose their bridges

The docs had references to https://docs.openstack.org but this
website is http only.  Connecting to the https address results in
an unable to connect error.

Replacing with http also makes it consistent with all other references
to docs.openstack.org.

There are user-owner permission checks in the db layer for keypairs.
Actually those permission should be checked by policy. As this patch
I45846f770628e8f24a8c137dcdc46baa64c50801 add policy rule enable admin
user can access non-admin user's keypairs, so the permission check
should be deleted from db layer.

Partially implements bp nova-api-policy-final-part
