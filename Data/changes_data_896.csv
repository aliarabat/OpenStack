TL;DR, here's what we want:

openstack/puppet-openstack-integration to run:
* check:
  - all puppet3 scenarios, voting (no change)
  - all puppet4 scenarios, non-voting
* gate:
  - all puppet3 scenarios, voting (no change)
* experimental:
  - puppet3 + puppet4 + all scenarios on Xenial
* periodic:
  - drop puppet4 jobs (move them to check)

openstack/puppet-* modules to run:
* check:
  - all puppet3 scenarios, voting (no change)
* gate:
  - all puppet3 scenarios, voting (no change)
* experimental:
  - all puppet4 scenarios, non-voting
  - puppet3 + puppet4 + all scenarios on Xenial

Long version:

Previously, we used to run puppet4 jobs in experimental AND periodic
pipelines.

We noticed that puppet4 jobs are breaking quite often and periodic jobs
are not enough for us since we don't have any notification to let us
know of failures. Indeed, the jobs appear in
http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health/#/ but only when Tempest
runs. Most of the failures don't reach Tempest run and fail before.

We think that we should start running puppet4 jobs in our check
pipeline, and we chose puppet-openstack-integration as a first
iteration, since this project does not have a lot of commits.

This patch does:

In Jenkins:
* Modify puppet-openstack-integration job-template:
  - stop using {pipeline} since everything will be in gate.
  - add {job-suffix} so we can use '-nv' later.
* Add '-nv' suffix to:
  - Xenial Puppet 3 job (we consider it experimental).
  - All Puppet 4 jobs.
* Do not use '-nv' jobs for those that we consider voting (puppet3 jobs
  on trusty & centos7).

In Zuul layout:
* Create puppet-openstack-integration-jobs-all-check-nv with all puppet4 jobs
  Note: we didn't add puppet3 job on Xenial because we want to keep it
  experimental (non-voting and run on demand) for now.
* Execute puppet-openstack-integration-jobs-all-check-nv jobs in
  puppet-openstack-integration project (not much commits per day, so
  won't consume a lot of resources).
* Create puppet-openstack-integration-jobs-all-exp-nv with the same jobs
  as puppet-openstack-integration-jobs-all-check-nv but using
  experimental pipeline. These jobs will be created for Puppet modules
  CI so we can check them at demand.
* Add '-nv' suffix to all jobs that we consider non-voting, experimental
  or not.

But if we some microversion needs change in all API.
For Example:
- Id92251243d9e92f30e466419110fce5781304823
where it will end up with having '<microversion>' folder under
each API sample files dir which does not looks much readable
structure.

To make it more readable and organized we should have <version> dir
at top and their sample files under it.

Something like below-
api_samples/
   v2.1/
       files (for v2.1/v2)
   <version1>
       <resource-name>/
           files

Booting an instance on a net without subnet (or what is the same on a
port without fixed_ips) leads to an error in nova compute because the
default security group cannot be applied without an IP on the port.
In order to catch this error earlier the NetworkRequiresSubnet and
PortRequiresFixedIP exceptions were introduced. If port_security_enabled
is False for either the net or the port that means security groups will
not be applied, we will not have an error, so we don't need to raise
the exceptions to catch the errors early.

Now functional sample files tests runs on both /v2 and /v2.1 endpoints.
But current sample files under doc/api_samples/ dir have /v2 in ref links

It is better to update the sample those files with /v2.1 versions in

And for new sample files generation, make only v2.1 tests to write the new files
which will adds /v2.1 version in sample files not /v2

This patch updates logic to write new sample files only by v2.1 tests
and update all current files with v2.1 version.

NOTE- Those files are being generated newly (by deleting old one and
let v2.1 tests to regenerate those). So there are other changes than

This commit adds a method to get migration objects with several
instance_uuids in mutiple states.

It adds migration_get_by_instances_with_multiple_statuses()
in db to avoid multiple database queries for the multiple status.
This method can get migrate objects in the one of several status.
Such as 'post-migrating', 'finished', 'reverting', and 'reverted'.

It also adds get_by_instances_with_multiple_statuses() in object
to avoid multiple database queries for the multiple status.

Cannot delete vm instance if duplicate delete requests are sent.

When user sends request to delete an instance, its task_state gets
changed to 'deleting' state. When an instance task_state is already in
'deleting' state and if at that moment the rabbitmq-server get crashed
by some reasons, then the instance task_state remains in 'deleting'
state and user won't be able to delete the instance forever.

At this moment, there is only one way to delete the instances, whose
task_state is 'deleting' state, by restarting the nova-compute
services where these instances are running.

To avoid restarting the nova-compute service manually, modified the
force-delete api to allow instance deletion irrespective of
instance task_state.

Added new instance task_state 'force-deleting' (which is set if instance
is deleted using force_delete api) to ignore duplicate force-delete
requests and still allowing retry on regular delete request.

Instead of directly trying to SIGKILL a active rsync/scp process
it is nicer to first try to give that process a SIGTERM so that it
can shutdown in a nice manner (then wait for it to respond) and then
if it still has not responded attempt to SIGKILL it. This adds that
loop to do just this.

It also moves toward using psutil (already a requirement) to do the
process term/kill and process location work, since that library already
does this in a way that works across operating systems and ensures that
pids are not reused while the kill/term loop is active.

This class is never soft-deleted, so it doesn't need the mixin.

It should be OK to remove the columns from the model (by removing the
mixin) because they have not been used for over a cycle (in fact, ever).
Doing this should result in an automatic schema contraction.

By the same token, it should be OK to remove shadow_bw_usage_cache as
nothing has ever been soft-deleted so this table should be empty.

On build, decrement a cell's available ram slots. Using the scheduler_count
configuration option the available capacity per cell is effectively divided
per scheduler. This prevents multiple schedulers from flooding the same cell
with build requests that exceed the capacity. Iff a scheduler has consumed
the entirety of the capacity allocated to it, begin consuming per cell
capacity reserved for other schedulers.

Scheduling larger instances will consume both the larger slot as well as
each of the smaller slots reported (e.g. a build request for a 2048 slot
will also consume two 1024 slots and four 512 slots).

We're working on getting Puppet Beaker jobs working on Ubuntu Xenial.

Current jobs are broken because:
* https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BKR-821
* Puppetlabs does not package Puppet3 for Ubuntu Xenial

This patch aims to deploy Puppet4 so we can make progress on running
beaker jobs on Ubuntu Xenial until BKR-821 is fixed (we'll probably try
to run Puppet3 again on Xenial).

For a local process based executor usage currently to ensure
that task emitted notifications are proxied we use the multi
processing library and use its queue concept. This sadly creates
a proxy process that gets associated, and this proxy process
handles the queue and messages sent to and from it. Instead of
doing this we can instead just create a temporary local socket
using a random socket and have tasks (which are running in
different processes) use that to communicate back any emitted
notifications instead (and we can use the asyncore module to handle
the emitted notifications since it handles the lower level socket
reading, polling and dispatching).

To ensure that the socket created is somewhat secure we use a
similar process as the multi-processing library uses where we
sign all messages with a hmac that uses a one time key that only
the main process and the child process know about (and reject
any messages that do not validate using this key).

The add_router_interface/remove_router_interface actions
are not subject to the typical attribute map validation
so the input values for port_id and subnet_id were not
being checked for UUID likeness. This lead to an ugly
traceback if a boolean value was present which could
fill logs with garbage if a tenant kept doing it.

This patch calls the API validator for UUIDs in the
_validate_interface_info function where we validate requests
to add_router_inferface and remove_router_interface.

Running the tests locally I'm seeing:
http://paste.openstack.org/show/493222/

The issue in all three tests is that the keepalived manager
process spawns asynchronously (sudo -> root_helper -> keepalived).

For the 'spawns' test, it was asserting that process.alive was
True when it should have used wait_until_true.

For the respawns* tests, the test grabs process.pid before the process
has necessarily spawned. Moving process.pid to after the wait_until_true(
process.active) loop guarantees that pid will return keepalived's
process. Otherwise the 'pid' variable will be None, then when we
use utils.execute we try to kill the 'None' pid, and that doesn't seem
to work.

When a router port is being attached to a network it
must first check that the new subnet(s) do not overlap
with any of the other subnets the router is already
attached to.

The previous code was calling the core plugin to look
up each attached subnet individually. This led to slow
responses if a router was attached to hundreds of other
subnets.

This patch just adjusts the logic to request all of the
subnets from the core plugin in one call so the number
of DB calls stays constant regardless of attached subnet
count.

This change moves the creation of stack watch tasks into its own thread
which retries until it has been done without error.

The intent is to prevent create_periodic_tasks from raising an error
when the database is not available, and retry stack watch creation until
the database becomes available.

Once execution gets past create_periodic_tasks() then systemd is
notified that the service is up, and heat will recover when the database

Apart from being shorter, this is also another step away from the
overloading of the term 'image' in the image backend. An 'image' in
this code refers either to the thing which glance stores, or an
instance's disk. Image in the latter context has come about because
that's what libvirt calls it. However, as it's overloaded in nova we
should never have used it. At some point I'd like to rename these all
to 'disk'.

This patch also renames 2 variables called 'backend' to 'root_disk',
to more accurately reflect their meaning. Changing the name of
check_image_exists() made these uses harder to read when the meaning
of the variable wasn't clear.

(Ib01d71ff9415a0ae04d963f6e380aab9ac2260ce).

For the most part, dib runs unprivileged.  Bits of the core code are
hopefully well tested (modulo bugs like the first one!).  We give free
reign inside the chroot (although there is still some potential there
for adverse external affects via bind mounts).  Where we could be a
bit safer (and could have prevented at least the second of these
breakouts) is with some better checking that the ""sudo"" calls
*outside* the chroot at least looked sane.

This adds a basic check that we're using chroot or image paths when
calling sudo in those parts of elements that run *outside* the chroot.
Various files are updated to accomodate this check; mostly by just
ignoring it for existing code (I have not audited these calls).

Nobody is pretending this type of checking makes dib magically safe,
or removes the issues with it needing to do things as root during the
build.  But this can help find egregious errors like the key removal.

The neutron-vpnaas repo already has converted to using constraints for
targets. However, the TC recommendation is to use constraints on the
original job names (pep8, py27,...), instead of using the constrained
names (e.g. pep8-constraints).

A separate commit (I34f0b355703fe0133f160afd4e32f2272d41ecaa) restored
the use of the non-constraint NAMED jobs for Liberty and newer.

This commit modifies those non-constraints targets so that they use
constraints. A manual check was made that each target used the same
package versions for both constraints and non-constraints targets.

Then, after both constraints and non-constraints jobs passed in Jenkins
(before and after the project-config commit was upstreamed), the constraints
based targets were removed from tox.ini.

Note: Found out that infra doesn't support constraints based cover and
releasenotes. Added TODO to these targets so that they can be updated,
if and when constraints are supported.

Note: In the gate hook, config_for_vpn_func_testing.sh calls Neutron's
config_for_func_testing.sh, which will setup files in the venv. To prevent
that script from modifying the VENV variable to have -constraints suffix
and store files in the wrong venv, we turn off USE_CONSTRAINT_ENV, prior
to calling the Neutron script.

Once this is upstreamed, we can backport this fix to Liberty to complete
the effort for this repo.

This modifies the expose and when decorators in
pecan to also include the olso db API retry logic
so all controllers that leverage these automatically
get the retry logic to handle temporary DB errors.

To accomplish this, the ATTR_NOT_SPECIFIED sentinel
was modified to be friendly to copy.deepcopy since
unlike in the old API, the new logic will be sending
copies to the core plugin after the attributes have
been populated.

This also includes a workaround for a bad assumption
in the pecan decorator utils that assumes all decorators
have a __code__ attribute.

Commit 9ec466cd42de94c2fad091edfd7583a5f47eb87a was not enough
since it checked l3 agents in the same transaction that was used
to fetch down bindings - so agents always were down even if actually
they went back online.
This commit adds context creation on each iteration to make sure
we use new transaction and fetch up-to-date info for the agent.

Mock now has assert_called and assert_called_once checks. We had
previously needed to watch out for these and replace them with
things like assertEqual(1, mocked.call_count) if a new patch
introduced them.

This was complicated by the fact that the gate has been using 2.0
for some time as it pulled the latest version, so it wouldn't catch
if there was an invalid call introduced. If a user was using a
previously installed version it would fail for them locally.

Rather than having conditional checks or needing to watch for these
incompatibilities in reviews, I propose we just make 2.0 the default.

Previously, if one wanted to try the ml2 plugin one would need to
manually modify this file. This is because it's source in the

This patch fixes this by only setting Q_PLUGIN to 'ovn' if it's not
already set.

This caused docs builds using setuptools at or beyond 20.2 to fail with:

This change set remedies the line to refer to __package__ (a builtin

Some kernel modules take substantial time to initialize. For example,
with mpt2sas RAID driver inspection and deployment randomly fail
due to IPA starting before the driver finishes initialization.

This problem is probably impossible to solve in a generic case, as
modern Linux environment do not have a notion of ""hardware is fully
initialized"" moment. All hardware is essentially hotplug.

To solve it at least for the simplest case, this patch adds a wait loop
on start up waiting for at least one suitable disk to appear in inventory.
Note that root device hints are not considered, as the node might not
be known at that moment yet.

Preprovision credential provider hashes credentials based on all
fields specified in the YAML. The same configured credentials can
be used to build both v2 and v3 credential objects, so we need to
hash on the fields that are common between v2 and v3 only.

Because v2 only understand tenants (and not project) the
intersection would be only user and password. Because of that, and
because we want to promote project against tenant, accept
project in v2 credentials as well, by translating it to tenant at
__init__ time.

An earlier patch added sorting so we could support mixing releases
for independent projects. The sort change broke the pre-release
collapsing logic, so we were showing release candidates as newer than
final releases. This change fixes the sorting logic to ensure that
pre-releases come before finals by ensuring that we can always parse
the version string.

The monasca-transform is a new component in Monasca that
aggregates and transforms metrics.

monasca-transform is a Spark based data driven aggregation
engine which collects, groups and aggregates existing individual
Monasca metrics according to business requirements and publishes
new transformed (derived) metrics to the Monasca Kafka queue.

Since the new transformed metrics are published as any other
metric in Monasca, alarms can be set and triggered on the
transformed metric, just like any other metric.

Currently swift pollsters only poll data from first region, which
is bad for multiple regions scenario.

This patch enables poll swift data for specific region. And improves
log message and promotes the log level to INFO, now it looks like:

In this change the new OpenStack-API-Version headers is allowed,
but not required, for requesting a microversion.

Both headers are accepted in the request and both headers are sent in
the response (both the header and its value, and the addition to the Vary
header).

Many tests which explicitly use a microversion header have been
updated to use both. This change is not 100% as most of the tests
are testing the handling of the value of the header, not which
header is involved.

At the moment, the Hyper-V driver uses the UNC path of images
stored on SMB shares, regardless if the share is remote or not.
According to the MS docs, this is not supported for SOFS SMB shares.

This is troublesome for the Hyper-C scenario, as Hyper-V will attempt
to modify the image ACLs, making them unusable.

The fix consists in checking if the share is local, and use the
local path in that case.

comments after the patch was merged. The changes are:

* Optimize the code by generating the list of reserved words for the
  nodes controller only once.

* List the reserved words in the release note.

* Improve the error string when someone tries to name a node using a
  reserved word.

* Add a comment for future reference indicating how we should try to
  model the API in case a new sub-controller needs to be added to the
  nodes controller class.

Using a Job and etcd, we can signal to Kubernetes when a bootstrapping
action is in progress and when it's complete.

When an action is in progress, the pods associated with the service will
poll etcd waiting for mariadb_bootstrapped to return true and exit(1).
Kubernetes will reschedule the pods until it passes.

The bootstrap container will manage the variable by signaling etcd
that a bootstrap is in progress. After the boostrap is complete,
the Job will exit(0) and not be rescheduled.

- the extension cookie was not applied as expected, even

Neutron plugin are able to do field selection on responses (for
instance only returning id & name for a resource). However,
Pecan does not leverage this capability and always tells the
plugin to fetch all fields, doing field selection while
processing the response.

This patch ensures that pecan send the field list down to the
plugin.

As a part of this patch TestRequestProcessing has been update
to inherit from TestRootController rather than
TestResourceController. Inheriting from the latter was causing
tests to be executed twice for no reason, beyong using
TestResourceController's 'port' attribute, which was however
unnecessary as this change proves.

Closes-Bug: #1570259

Nova deprecated 2.0 API in Liberty and will remove it in Newton.

This patch does 3 things:
* in nova::keystone::auth, create nova API 2.1 endpoints by default and
  not 2.0 anymore that is going to be removed.
  puppet-keystone will update endpoints for the 'compute' service with
  the new URL.
* in nova::keystone::auth, deprecate all parameters related to v3. They
  are useless, since we now use v2.1 by default and it's the version
  that is what v3 started out as.
  Note: puppet-keystone won't remove the v3 endpoint. You can do it with
  puppet-keystone or manually.
* deprecate osapi_v3 in nova::api. The parameter is useless and does not
  need to bet set.

List of parameters deprecated:
* osapi_v3
* auth_name_v3
* service_description_v3
* service_name_v3
* public_url_v3
* internal_url_v3
* admin_url_v3
* configure_endpoint_v3

They have no effect and will be removed in a future release.

Provider networks can be given static route information that is
populated on all containers. This commit only tests the common cases
around that code - adding a static route as expected, and attempting to
add one with missing information.

Currently, the code fails silently if the cidr or gateway for a static
route are missing. This change adds an exception informing the user that
there is missing static route information. The information is
purposefully general (no specific cases for missing cidr/gateway) in
order to keep the conditionals simple in the code.

Also, the change now checks to make sure that a value is present in
addition to the key, and the variable names are clarified. The values
provided are not check to be valid CIDRs or IP addresses at this time.

A release note and documentation were added given the new errors.

The test cases were split into their own class so as to reduce the
sprawl in the TestConfigChecks class.

Providing VPNaaS service in networking environments that have their own
L3 implementations (such as OVN), requires the VPNaaS logic to be
decoupled from the Neutron L3 agent.  Regardless of how this decoupling
is accomplished, it is desirable to reuse as much of the existing VPNaaS
server and agent logic as possible.

because I’m still trying to determine best direction forward to handle
this requirement.

There are a number of ways that VPNaaS support can be added to OVN. The
current VPNaaS support in neutron is built on top of the L3 router. Work
was done to decouple the VPNaaS logic from the L3 rotuer in patch:

   https://review.openstack.org/#/c/298323/

In order to reuse the existing neutron VPNaaS code base, a neutron DB
router object and an IP namespace are required. This patch, used in
conjunction with the one listed above, will allow two different types of
routers to be active: the normal OVN router and an agent based VPN
specific router. In order to distinguishing between the two types of
routers, the router name field is being used. Obviously that will need
to change.

Requiring a 2nd router for the VPN traffic is not ideal and it is not
consistent with the current neutron VPNaaS user experience today. It
may be possible to reuse the existing neutron router object created for
an OVN router and add-on the additional VPNaaS fields that are required.
It would be nice if the existing RPC L3/VPN flows to the agent code
could be preserved without change, but that might not be possible. Work
to move to a single OVN router is ongoing. Feedback and suggestions are
welcome. This patch will be updated as that work progresses.

A cluster in vcenter is exposed as a compute node on nova.
There can be a maximum of 64 hosts per cluster.
Currently, for an instance/server group, ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter
would schedule only one instance per cluster. The maximum number of
instances from a server group can only be equal to number of
clusters/compute nodes.

This patch adds a new capability 'resource_scheduling' and used in
scheduler filters.
ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter behavior is fixed
such that if the driver+host has 'resource_scheduling' capabilities
then select the host and pass the anti-affinity placement to be done
done by vcenter [1].
This change would allow deploying more instances within a cluster.

Tempest to keep rolling.
This will be reverted once we sort things out.

2) rabbitmq: install packages from distro repos

Stop installing RabbitMQ from rabbitmq.com repository.

rabbitmq.com is providing a terrible and frustrating experience of
packaging repository:
* rabbitmq.com is very often down and we have to recheck our jobs
  everytime it happens.
* packaging signature is currently broken, see [1].

From this patch, we'll deploy RabbitMQ using distro repositories.

This commit fixes a bug when the data returned from subunit2sql is
missing the required fields, like in the case of periodic jobs, to
use the elastic-recheck classifier. Previously it was assumed all
runs being returned from subunit2sql would have an associated change
and the metadata associated with that, but this wasn't always true.
So now it will just skip trying to do an ES lookup if all the required
fields aren't present.

This will help to identify on the backend what requests are being

This patch fixes an issue where template VLUNs are left
behind during a detach.  This can happen when a volume is
exported via multiple ports to support multipath and at
detach time one of those paths becomes inactive, bad nic,
pulled cable, etc.

The 3PAR inactive VLUNs are actually templates.  When you
delete a template VLUN, all active VLUNs associated with
that template are also removed.  This patch deletes
template VLUNs at detach time.

Some kernel modules take substantial time to initialize. For example,
with mpt2sas RAID driver inspection and deployment randomly fail
due to IPA starting before the driver finishes initialization.

As much as I hate it, the only way to guarantee that the hardware is
truely initalized is to wait for it. Apparently all hardware in Linux
is treated as hotplugged, so there is no such thing as ""hardware
initialization is finished"". Operators can add a sleep based on their
knowledge of their hardware.

The default behaviour remains the same.
