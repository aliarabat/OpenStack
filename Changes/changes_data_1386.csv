Given the backend location from Glance, drivers can determine
whether they can clone or otherwise efficiently create a volume
from the image without downloading all the data from Glance.

For now implement cloning for the RBD driver. There's already a
Glance backend that stores images as RBD snapshots, so they're
ready to be cloned into volumes. Fall back to copying all the
data if cloning is not possible.

Updates the disk config extension to check for 'server' in the
request body before trying to use it. This avoids a potential
KeyError exception. Given that we already validate the 'server'
dict in servers.py and raise a proper exception there this seems
reasonable to me... no reason to duplicate all of the validation
logic.

The reason this change was able to make it into Nova to begin
with is that the Extensions loader orders things differently
depending on the OS/python version being used. I tested this
by running SchedulerHintsTestCase.test_create_missing_server
on both Fedora 16 (passes) and Fedora 17 (fails). The problem
only manifests itself when the disk config extension gets called
before the scheduler_hints extension. To fix this issue
I've updated the scheduler_hints extensions in this patchset
to simply pass when 'server' isn't defined which like above seems
reasonable because we already validate this in servers.py.

As part of this fix I'm also moving test_create_missing_server out
of the Scheduler Hints tests and into a new ServersAllExtensionsTestCase
class in test_servers.py which explicitly tests for things with *all*
extensions enabled. As part of the move I also updated the test to
look for HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity which is what we throw when
'server' doesn't exist in a POST to servers (the correct exception).

partial fix for bug 1004328

Only the xen hypervisor actually respects the device name that
is passed in attach_volume. For other hypervisors it makes much
more sense to automatically generate a unique name.

This patch generates a non-conflicting device name if one is not
passed to attach_volume. It also validates the passed in volume
name to make sure another device isn't already attached there.

A corresponding change to novaclient and horizon will greatly
improve the user experience of attaching a volume.

It moves some common code out of metadata/base so that it can
be used to get a list of block devices. The code was functionally
tested as well and block device name generation works properly.

This adds a new method to the rpcapi to validate a device name. It
also adds server_id to the volumes extension, since it was omitted
by mistake.

The next step is to modify the libvirt driver to match the serial
number of the device to the volume uuid so that the volume can
always be found at /dev/disk/by-id/virtio-<uuid>.

This change adds checks in the ComputeFilter to verify compute hosts can
support the (architecture, hypervisor_type, vm_mode) triple specified
in the instance properties, improving support for heterogeneous clouds.

Images can be marked with the architecture, hypervisor, and virtual
machine mode they require, e.g.

glance image-update --property architecture=x86_64 \
  --property hypervisor_type=kvm <image-uuid>
glance image-update --property architecture=i686 \
  --property hypervisor_type=xen --property vm_mode=xen <image-uuid>
glance image-update --property architecture=x86_64 \
  --property hypervisor_type=xen --property vm_mode=hvm <image-uuid>

These properties are included in the request_spec part of the run_instance
RPC message and made available to the ComputeFilter.  The ComputeFilter
will only pass compute nodes that satisfy the specified properties.
If no properties are specified, the ComputeFilter behavior is unchanged.

Adding these checks to the compute filter seems consistent with its
definition [1]:

""ComputeFilter - checks that the capabilities provided by the compute
service satisfy the extra specifications, associated with the instance
type.""

Modified IPtablesManager.apply() method to save/restore chain and
rule packet:byte counts by using the '-c' flag with iptables-save
and iptables-restore calls.  Currently they are zeroed every time
we change something in the table.  This will allow users to better
analyze usage for instances over an extended period of time, for
example, for billing purposes.

Change all applicable iptables, libvirt and Xen tests to account
for the changes made to support the packet:byte counts.

This work uncovered two bugs in the existing implementation
found during my testing, specifically:

1. Fix IptablesManager to clean-up non-wrapped chains correctly,
   instead of leaving them in the kernel's table.  We now keep a
   list of chains and rules we need to remove, and double-check
   in apply() that they are filtered-out.

2. Fix IptablesManager to honor ""top=True"" iptables rules by only
   adding non-top rules after we've gone through all the top rules
   first.

Implements first work item of blueprint libvirt-network-usage.

Fixes bug 1037127 and bug 1037137.

The 'name' field for some resources is called something different,
for example 'display_name' for volumes. There was a hack in our
find method to search for display_name as well.

This change adds a new class variable to a Resource to tell it
which attribute to use for searching by name. Volumes and snapshots
were switched to use 'display_name' and hypervisors were switched
to use 'hypervisor_hostname'.

Tests fixed and added.

Current upstream code simply compares capability and extra_specs and if they are different, it is rejected. The proposal extends it to various operations such as >= and <= to cover cases that happen in our HPC heterogeneous with OpenStack. The proposed code does not provide resource management function. (The actual management is done by hypervisor (nova-compute).) The blueprint can be found at http://wiki.openstack.org/InstanceTypeExtraSpecsExtension.\n\nNote that the code that manages resource in compute/manager (not scheduler/manger) in the first few patches are now removed. So, currently, the code does not have any function that can be found in host_manager. \n\nIt would be desirable and efficient if scheduler can update the resource usage right away instead of waiting for the updated information from compute node. This can be done if database schema is modified to include extra specs. We plan to do this with another merge proposal.\n\nJoe,\n\nThanks for your review on our merge proposal.\n\nThe proposed merge is for different purpose than the HostAggreates. HostAggregates partitions hosts into aggregates so that a host among an aggregate can be selected.\n\nIn the proposed code, hosts are selected using a math function. So, for example, extra_specs can have many different conditions such as gpus>=2 and math_lib_version >= 2.1.3. Another extra_spec can have gpus >=4 and math_lib_version >= 1.3.2. In these examples, only two variables are used, but more than two variables can be used. The resulting ""set"" of hosts from different conditions can overlap as in the previous example. The proposal can handle any combination of such conditions easily. It is not easy to provide this functionality using HostAggregate especially when the number of variables is large.\n\nSo, if HostAggregate is implemented, the proposed merge is still needed to select a subset of the hosts in an easy way in an aggregate unless an aggregate has exactly the same feature list. Thus, these two are orthogonal. The proposed merge can be refactored once HostAggregate is merged.\n\nMark,\n\nThanks for your review on our merge proposal. Capabilities will be populated by hypervisor.\n\nThe json filter has a common function of comparing required resource and capabilities. However, the proposed merge needs to handle more operations such as handling numbers and strings differently. One solution is to extend the json filter but it may cause confusion to general json filter users. We thought a way to utilize the json filter following your comment, but realized the difference is still big, so we thought it would be cleaner approach to extend compute_filter that was originally designed to handle extra specs and leave json filter intact.\n\nThe information in the instance_type_extra_specs flag is to be handled by hypervisor. As described in the blueprint, each hypervisor may have a different way of managing the information, so, we decided to leave it out of the proposed code. In fact, another related proposal includes the code fo bare metal case, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/general-bare-metal-provisioning-framework that uses the flag and manages the information there.'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-06-22 12:34:45.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 11: Works for me\n\nBuild successful\n\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-merge/3302/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-pep8/4699/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-python26/901/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-python27/909/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-integration-tests-devstack-vm/5914/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n'}, {'account_id': 1030, 'date': '2012-06-27 00:02:00.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 11: No score\n\nRemoving -2 for now'}, {'account_id': 1030, 'date': '2012-06-27 00:09:57.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 11: I would prefer that you didn't merge this\n\n(3 inline comments)\n\n""}, {'account_id': 1176, 'date': '2012-06-27 01:04:39.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 12.'}, {'account_id': 1176, 'date': '2012-06-27 01:08:53.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 11: (3 inline comments)\n\nThanks for Chris' help!""}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-06-27 14:34:37.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 12: Doesn't seem to work\n\nBuild failed\n\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-merge/3506/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-pep8/4890/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-python26/1092/ : FAILURE\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-python27/1100/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-integration-tests-devstack-vm/6367/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n""}, {'account_id': 1176, 'date': '2012-06-27 19:04:46.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 13.'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-06-27 19:18:19.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 13: Works for me\n\nBuild successful\n\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-merge/3663/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-pep8/4961/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-python26/1158/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-nova-python27/1171/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-integration-tests-devstack-vm/6532/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n'}, {'account_id': 100, 'date': '2012-06-28 18:25:39.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 13: I would prefer that you didn't merge this\n\n(4 inline comments)\n\nThis is just a low-level review of the code""}, {'account_id': 1176, 'date': '2012-06-29 14:26:48.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 14.'}, {'account_id': 1176, 'date': '2012-06-29 14:31:35.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 13: (4 inline comments)\n\nJohannes' comments addressed.

This continues the work Michael did on blueprint config-drive-v2

Things added:
 * web service /openstack/2012-08-10 with:
   user_data
   meta_data.json
 * web service supporting /openstack/content

Things changed:
 * Changed the name 'files' (/openstack/files) to be 'content'
   This is to be more generic and apply to future re-use of it
   for some purpose other than personalities (injected_files)
 * 'meta_data.json' and 'user_data' are used for openstack
 * 'user-data' (without .raw) in the ec2 config drive rendering
 * 'content_path' is a attribute of each of the entries in the 'files'
   its value is the path from the openstack metadata service root to
   where the content is located.

   This means that the user does not have to know anything explicit about
   '/content'.  They just have to take the 'content_path' and append it
   to the top level entry point of metadata service.

   Explicit example:
   http://169.254.169.254/openstack/2012-08-10/meta_data.json
   has:
     files[{path: ""/etc/passwd"", content_path: ""/content/0001""}]
   To get the file, user appends 'content_path' to
     http://169.254.169.254/openstack
 * network config (Template) is available in /content also, and
   the key that points to it is 'network_config'. This occurs only
   if there are network's that are ""injected"" (same behavior as previously)

The meta_data.json now contains
  uuid: <instance uuid>
  meta: meta tags provided they will appear in a dict here
  files:
     This is a list of dicts, where each dict has 2 fields:
       * 'path' (the path provided)
       * 'content_id': the location in /content/ that will give the content
  public-keys:
     Dict of keyname : value
  network_config:
     This is a dict, containing 'content_path' and 'name' (network_config)
  hostname: the hostname
  name: the nova boot name

TODO:
 * want to add other items into openstack metadata
   * public-hostname
   * IP addresses
   * keystone-endpoint
   * url of metadata service: ideally only show this if there
     is a web service available.  the path seems hard coded at the moment
     to be http://169.254.169.254/openstack, but I do not know if there
     is a way to determine if one is present or not.

Fixes bug 1036153

If a user has admin role, network list returned by Quantum API contains
networks that does not belong to that tenant. As a result networks owned
by other tenants are listed in ""Network"" tab of ""Launch Intance"" menu.
Thus we need to specify tenant_id when calling network_list() to
retrieve only the networks available for the tenant.

In addition this commit added a validation logic to syspanel instance
launching workflow. It checks whether the owner tenant of the requested
network(s) matches the tenant specified in the launching panel.

Right now, the task_state logic in compute/api.py can be broken, such
that instances can get stuck in an uneditable state if an action is
performed that fails. The task_state remains something like 'stopping'
even though the action has not been completed or queued, and further
requests that depend on task_state will fail (see check_instance_state()
in compute/apy.py).

The only way out of it is to delete the instance or hack the database.

This patch adds a reverts_task_state() decorator to compute/manager.py,
which, upon operation failure, reverts the instance's task_state back
to None.

It also adds a test_state_revert() test to verify that all the actions
marked for state reversion do the right thing. It also corrects several
other tests that specifically expect the task_state to remain after
an error has occurred.

In an upcoming release, rbd will support creating volumes from

'protected', which means it cannot be deleted until it is unprotected.
A snapshot can only be unprotected if no clones depend on it. Thus,
translate a failure to unprotect into a SnapshotIsBusy exception.

Also check for remaining snapshots before deleting a volume,

blueprint quantum-api-quotas

We implement it as an extension for linux bridge and ovs plugins.
We also expose the /quotas/Xx url to client to operate the quota.
We need admin role to show other tenant's quota, and to update quota data.
Any user can show its own tenant's quota. An DB table is used to save the
quota for each tenant.

To use it, we have in quantum.conf:
quota_driver = quantum.extensions._quotav2_driver.DbQuotaDriver

The default quotas for each tenant are defined in quantum.conf too.

In addition, modify extension framework to allow exposing a new resource and
its controler. The extension can check the environment, such as configuration
in global cfg.CONF to decide if it can be enabled.

Also, we can define enabled extensions for each plugin in extensions.py
New resources can be put into quota framework via quota_items in nova.conf

Fixes LP 1030010.

Close off a back-door allowing users to go over-quota on ram
and/or cores by creating a tiny instance and then resizing
to any size regardless of the remaining usage headroom.

The quota management logic is distributed in the sense that
the reservations are passed with the RPC casts that may fail
silently, so that the rollback or commit is handled by the
actor finalizing the resize/confirmation/reversion.

Up-sizing requires there is sufficient quota headroom upfront
to accommodate the larger size, whereas conversely down-sizing
only results in a usage reduction when the resize is confirmed.

Enhances provider extension to support flat networks and VLANs on
multiple physical networks. Implements blueprint provider-networks.

To create a flat network using the CLI with admin rights:

net-create --tenant_id <tenant-id> <net-name> --provider:network_type flat --provider:physical_network <physical-network>

To create a VLAN network using the CLI with admin rights:

net-create --tenant_id <tenant-id> <net-name> --provider:network_type vlan --provider:physical_network <physical-network> --provider:vlan_id <vlan-id>

The provider extension is supported by the linuxbridge and openvswitch
plugins and their agents [openvswitch phase 2 implementation is
in-progress, and does not yet support flat networks or multiple
interfaces].

Ranges of VLANs available on named physical networks for normal
allocation are specified in the plugin's config file via the
ListOpt syntax:

network_vlan_ranges = <physical_network>:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>

The mapping of each named physical network to its physical network
interface is specified (per-agent-host) in the agent's config file via
the ListOpt syntax:

physical_interface_mappings = <physical_network>:<physical_interface>

See quantum/plugins/linuxbridge/README for details and examples of
network_vlan_ranges and physical_interface_mappings usage.

Also, bulk operations are enabled for the linuxbridge plugin.

This patch rewrites the Glance-specific code within Nova to use
the new python-glanceclient library. The old client is deprecated
in Folsom and should not be used in conjunction with
python-glanceclient.

This removes the dependency on installing 'glance' through pip.

Implements bp integrate-python-glanceclient

- load extension middleware as well as core API
- support 'action' requests in addition to CRUD ops
- add helper methods that check API return code
- clean-up places where existing tests where hitting 409s on delete
but ignoring the errors (basically SubnetInUse errors).

Fix conversion of TypeError to Fault in ResourceExceptionHandler.
TypeError can result when the list of extensions is inovked if the
parameters don't match the extension method's signature.

Specifically, if an empty body was sent with an HTTP POST to create a
server, a 500 error was returned.  This change is a fix to properly
return a 400 instead.

(In Python2.6, the ex_value argument of __exit__ is type string when
ex_type is a TypeError, which caused the conversion logic to get
skipped.)

bw_usage_update() most commonly updates rows vs creates rows.  New rows
are only created on the 1st bandwidth update for an instance or when
the audit period rolls over.  This cuts down DB queries to 1 for the

Bug 1020639

The API layer is now able to issue bulk create requests to the plugin,
assuming that the plugin supports them. Otherwise, the API layer will
emulate atomic behavior.
This patch also implements OVS plugin support for bulk requests.

The current implementation interprets set_default('foo', None) and
set_override('foo', None) as 'clear the existing default or override',
which makes it impossible to override a value with None.

This patch adds support for overriding with a None value by adding
a special internal class. set_override('foo', None) will now override
the existing value with None. This is a slight change to the existing
behavior, so this patch adds two calls for the old functionality of
clearing defaults and overrides. Example syntax for the new calls
are shown below:

conf.clear_default('foo')
conf.clear_override('foo')

The patch also updates the tests to reflect the change in functionality
and adds new tests to verify the new functionality.

Do we have owner group concept? \n\nThe second triad, as stated in comments in the source code, is ignored at the moment. I don\'t think it will be used for the owner group, because we don\'t have a group concept in keystone, and also because in linux filesystem that triad is not really for the owner\'s group, but for the currrent user group.

What is the semantic for reading, writing and execution.\n\nThe third triad is mapped by default to a QuantumUser role. See policy.json. Users of Quantum can then decide to map world to whatever they like.\n\nThe current patch implements the consensus which came out of the Quantum IRC meeting a two weeks ago. Of course, nothing is committed. If other people feel strongly against this permission access mechanism, I will be happy to revert to a flag based solution, although \'public\' raised some concerns about the name. My personal idea is that it is not necesary to define all the semantics now, but as long as we have the mechanism in place we can them discuss the semantics in detail at the next summit.'}, {'account_id': 261, 'date': '2012-08-13 12:19:07.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7: (28 inline comments)\n\n'}, {'account_id': 261, 'date': '2012-08-13 12:19:07.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7:\n\nI kind of had a suspect that the discussion over public networks was far from over.\n\nAt this stage I think that for Folsom, reverting to the simple flag is the best option.

Hence, from the various proposal that rained on me a few weeks ago, I would choose ""Shared"", with a boolean value.\nI reckon that we want to avoid enumerated string as much as possible. \nAnd since at this stage a network is either shared or not, the boolean flag makes sense. \n\nPlease note that we will definitely avoid any backward-incompatible change in Grizzly. So this flag will stay there, even if then we will implement a full ACL solution. This should be easily feasible IMHO.\n\nComing back to Matt\'s comments, the choice fell on linux-style permissions because it represents an easy to understand and widespread ACL model. The difference in our case is that the second and third triad would map to some groups that are then specified in policy.json, as there is (and there will not be) any concept of ""group"" and ""world"". But I understand we can do much better than that.\n\nOne thing I would like to preserve, even if reverting to a single flag, is the extension to the policy engine (that will be adapted for dealing with a single flag rather than a permission bitmask). This is because the rule-based policy engine in openstack common required some kind of hackey tricks for implementing the ""read"" policy on shared networks (see patchset 1 for details)'}, {'account_id': 261, 'date': '2012-08-13 12:19:07.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7: (1 inline comment)\n\n'}, {'account_id': 261, 'date': '2012-08-13 12:19:07.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7:\n\nLooks like the root cause of the problem is an unchecked corner case, when authZ is checked for returned objects.

Implements blueprint quantum-v2-public-networks

This patch allows Quantum to handle public networks. It modifies the
API adding a new attribute to the network resource ('shared')
and enhances the policy engine in order to handle the behaviour of
the service wrt shared networks.
Policy.json specifies a default behaviour which can be changed by
the administrator, even at runtime.
Tests added to test_db_plugin validate 'obvious' behaviour - such as
that only the ports belonging to a given tenant should be returned
even when they are queried on a public network.
Tests added to test_policy instead validate the changes added to the
policy engine.

The networks are loaded without specifying the tenant_id:\n\n    networks = api.quantum.network_list(request)\n\nThis returns all available networks. But when the current tenant is \'Admin\', which doesn\'t have networks, the \'net1\' network is shown as a network option in \'Create Instance\', thus the \'Create Instance\' action fails, because Nova cannot find the network \'net1\' for tenant \'Admin\' and returns this error:\n\n    The resource could not be found.

I\'m unable to start quantum in devstack with OpenVSwitch plugin. It gives me some error, but maybe this is a config problem in setup. Using linuxbridge instead works.

This is in preparation for cinder blueprint
efficient-volumes-from-images. If the same rbd cluster is used by
glance and cinder, a new volume can be created as a copy-on-write
clone by the ceph cluster rather than downloading all the data from
glance.

Since bp api-v2-store-access is implemented, make the location for the
rbd store more specific, so cinder can check that it's accessing the
same backend as glance. fsid is a unique identifier for a Ceph cluster.

Within a cluster, the full specification of an rbd image includes

clone is only possible in rbd on a protected snapshot, so after
uploading an image to rbd, create a snapshot and protect
it. Protection means it can't be deleted until it is unprotected, so
you can't accidentally render any clones unusable by removing their
parent. Add a new exception, InUseByStore, to handle a snapshot or
image that's still protected or otherwise in use.

More details can be found at
http://ceph.com/docs/master/dev/rbd-layering/.

For backwards compatibility, only use these new features if they are
supported by the installed librados and librbd python bindings. Otherwise
fallback to the previous location specifier which only includes image
id, since cloning won't work anyway.

Since the location parsing is now a bit more complicated, add unit
tests for it.

Fixes bug 1034401

When a compute service is restarted each instance running on the
host has its iptables rules built and applied sequentially during
the host init stage. The impact of this, especially on a host
running many instances, can be observed as a period where some
instances are not accessible as the existing iptables rules have
been torn down and not yet re-applied.

The presented work-around for this is a configurable/flagged deferred
mode that prevents the application of the iptables rules until all
instances on the host had been initialised then the rules for all
instances are applied all at once preventing a 'blackout' period.

The python-glanceclient pythonic API shouldn't break until v2 is
released, so let's allow anything up to that known point.

Alters the way test exceptions are constructed so that we're
not dependent on the internals of how 3rd party libraries
handle their exceptions while still being able to use them
for real testing in Horizon.

The note this patch removes was causing confusion, as it appeared
to insinuate that not using a 404 return code for non-existing pages
in the compute api was a bug. Actually the empty set behaviour is
normal and expected.

This is an old bug - feedback welcome :)

This is the first cut of config drive v2. Some points to note:

 - implements a helper to create new-style config drives. These
   config drives can be VFAT or ISO9660, this is controlled by
   a flag. The current default is ISO9660.

 - the config drives contain all the injected files, as well as
   everything returned from the ec2 style metadata service. Only
   the most recent version of the ec2 metadata is used, but future
   versions will appear as well.

 - the v1 functionality of specifying an image from glance to have
   the files injected into is dropped.

 - the location for file injection is now a directory named
   openstack/files, not the root level of the filesystem. Filename
   mapping is in the openstack metadata files.

 - the default format for the config drive is iso9660, although
   the previous vfat is available with a flag change.

 - includes the first version of an openstack metadata format.

 - there are some simple unit tests which probably need more done
   to them.

Partially implements bp config-drive-v2.

When running devstack, nova moves the host ip from eth0 onto the
bridge. This causes devstack to fail on the second run unless you
explicitly set HOST_IP in localrc.

This patch searches for an ip on the interface that is used for
the default route. This will be eth0 (or en0) in most cases, but
it will search br100 instead if nova has moved the ip, since it
moves the default route as well.

It also will filter out ips from the potential list that are part
of the fixed range and floating range if the netaddr library is
installed. This allows us to find the proper ip even if we have
accidentally left a floating ip or fixed ip on the bridge.

Fixes bug 1029495

The trigger_members_refresh method in compute.api.py specifies
a group id in the call to refresh_security_group_members. This
is just the last group id seen and ignores the fact that a
refresh may impact members of multiple groups.

This is masked by the fact that on the host the group id is
ignored and all instances have their security rules refreshed
regardless of if they are part of the changed group or not.

This change modifies the logic surrounding refreshes so we send
a refresh request for each instance which is affected by a
security group change, this ensures we aren't spending time
refreshing unaffected instances and also removes the possibility
of refreshing an instance multiple times if it is a member of
more than one group.

Also changed to be instance-centric is the refresh carried out
when a rule is added/removed to a security group.

partially implements blueprint disable-server-extensions

This patch adds an output extension for security group output
and modifies the servers code to only allow security groups
to be specified if the os-security-groups extension is
enabled.

Duplicated security group functionality was removed from the
createserverext extension, it is now a duplicate of the servers
endpoint. The boot_from_volume extension was also changed
to inherit the servers functionality so that security_groups
will continue to work. The block_device_mapping code will be
modified in a subsequent patch.

Tests were added for new functionality, and existing tests were
modified slightly. The disk_config extension was modified to be
a bit more lenient so the data for it doesn't need to be mocked
out in other tests.

Related to blueprint cfg-global-object

When using the global config object pattern, you often have modules
which define options that are referenced in other options.

So, for example if module A defined option 'foo' and module be needed
to reference that option, you might do:

  import A
  print CONF.foo

However, this makes it entirely unclear to the casual reader why
module A was imported.

Nova has a flags.DECLARE() function that helps with this problem
by allowing you to do:

  flags.DECLARE('foo', 'A')

The function simply imports module A and checks that the 'foo'
option is now defined in the global config object.

This is fine, but it is also implicit that this function applies
to the global config object. Instead, let's do the following:

  CONF.import_opt('foo', 'A')

But the only reason the old plugins actually needed to poll was to be ""notified"" about changes to a port state (e.g., admin status, etc) made via the API at some point other than when the VM boots.  This patch (as we talked about on IRC briefly) doesn\'t seem to handle that case.  \n\nMy current thinking here is: \n1) we can use the notifications stuff that Yong is added so that agents can have a standard interface for learning when a port is updated (ideally, the set of notifications sent to an agent could be filtered at the source to include only the ports they want notifications for). \n2) the process of grabbing information about a port can be done via the standard quantum APIs, rather than designing and testing a second method for fetching such info.  \n\nI think this issue is really important, so I think we should discuss it a bit at the meeting on monday, and potentially have dedicated discussion involving interested parties (including folks developing the dhcp and l3-agents).

The purpose of the patch is to remove the database polling and access from the agents and to make the agents more scalable. The current state is that when a tap device is created on the agent the agent will request the port details and configure accordingly.\nI am currently working on adding the code for the the agents to get a notification that port/network status has changed (I looked at the OVS and LB V2 plugins with my tests they did not treat this). I do not think that the notifications code is a good solution for this problem - I do not see how the plugin can know which agent has the relevant details - which implies that a broadcast will have to be sent. \nI had a number of thoughts about addressing the problem:\n1. In the current solution the agents poll the plugin with a health check id. If the ID is not consistent with the agent ID then the agent will ask for the state of all of its ports. A very naive option would be to reset the ID and the agents will update their ports accordingly. This may suffice when there are a small amount of agents running a small amount of VM\'s. This is certainly not scalable.\n2. Piggy back information on the health check answers. The answer for the health check should include the updated ID\'s. Say a port state was update then this ID will be appended to the health check method. The agent knows if it owns the port and if so it will request its details and update accordingly. It is kind of like a notification of all of the updated entities in the last interval.\n3. Have the plugin notify the agents of all changes. This requires that a RPC server must be running on all of the agents. This may be similar to the notifications - but is a but more refined as the plugin has the ""topic"" of the agents.\n\nAny other ideas or suggestions will be great.\n\nIn the mean time I have addressed your comments. When I push the next change I\'ll set it to -1 until we have resolved what we would like to do.\n\nThanks\nGary'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-08-10 16:25:23.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 3: Works for me\n\nBuild successful\n\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-merge/896/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-docs/148/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-pep8/768/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-python26/537/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-python27/538/testReport : SUCCESS\n'}, {'account_id': 1653, 'date': '2012-08-10 16:25:23.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 3.'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-08-10 16:25:23.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 4: Works for me\n\nBuild successful\n\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-merge/900/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-docs/152/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-pep8/772/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-python26/541/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-python27/542/testReport : SUCCESS\n'}, {'account_id': 261, 'date': '2012-08-10 16:25:23.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 4: (9 inline comments)\n\nA few more comments and question from me.\n\nThanks Gary for starting to tackle this very important aspect of Quantum architecture.'}, {'account_id': 447, 'date': '2012-08-10 16:25:23.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 4: (1 inline comment)\n\n'}, {'account_id': 447, 'date': '2012-08-10 16:25:23.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 4: (14 inline comments)\n\nOk, I think we're converging here...

Updates the FaultWrapper middleware so that it properly handles
exceptions which contain a code variable set to None. Previously
you'd get TypeError exception like this in the api.log file:

 TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not NoneType

This was due to the fact that we tried to format a string with
an integer value which was set to None.

I hit this today when using Qpid which does in fact throw exceptions
which contain 'code' variables set to None.

Fixes LP Bug #1035159.

This method was added here:

  https://code.launchpad.net/~tr3buchet/nova/multi_nic/+merge/64767

but appears never to have been used.

We can safely remove it and the 'force' parameter to network_associate()
which only it uses.

This removal from the network service RPC API would not warrant a
major version number bump since nothing ever used this part of the
API.

As cinder already supports volume types, it's time
to be added in Horizon. The types are added in syspanel.
A volume can either have a *valid* type, or None.

There are two minor issues:
1. When a type is deleted, if there is a volume with
   this type, the type is returned as the id,
   instead of the name. Which is good as consistency,
   but maybe a type should not be deleted if used by a volume?
2. If no vol type is passed(None) value, the type is being
   assigned as 'None', and returned as a string('None')
3. In the create volume type form, the 'Description' is
   empty at the moment, I couldn't find any help info
   to add for volume types...

Some more unit tests will be added, but this is just a preview.

Fixes bug 1022418

PATCH SET 2: rebased with master, added some more unit tests

NOTE: forced requirement for python-novaclient==2.6.10,
as Jenkins installs the latest stable 2012.1 instead...

Fixes bug #1035035

The default autorebasing behavior of git review can have unexpected
consequences, especially when attempting to add a new review that
is dependent on another in progress review. Like accidently turning
other people's code into drafts.

Disabling autorebase will protect us from these kinds of accidents.

Previously when an instance delete is repeated while a
delete is already in progress, the relevant quota usages
were reduced twice.

This is already healing logic in place to catch the special
case where these counts fall below zero, in which case the
sync method re-calculates the appropriate in-use count.

However this will only help the case at hand when the instance
count is itself trending towards zero, and not in general when
there's a healthy number of active instances.

Now we check the instance task state before making the quota
usage reduction.

A simple solution for bug 1008866. When creating volume from snapshot on
multicluster, in volume it will check if snapshot_id is set. If snapshot_id
is set and FLAGS.snapshot_same_host is true, make the call create volume
directly to the volume host where the snapshot resides instead of passing it
through the scheduler. So snapshot can be copy to new volume. The same as
review 9761.

First of all - roles<->Project is 1-to-Many relation. So when using a dropdown to add a role for a project, we do not change the role, but actually add a new role. That's the reason why this code now raises an exception if trying to add the same role twice - it is already present for the user-tenant..\n\nI would suggest something simple - to remove the role dropdown and immediately after updating the user's default tenant:\n \n    api.user_update_tenant(request, user, tenant)\n\nto be added a check for existing roles and to show a warning if no role exists for the tenant - something like this:\n\n    user_roles = api.roles_for_user(request, user, tenant)\n    if not user_roles:\n        messages.warning(request, _('The user %s has no role defined for that project.' % data['name']))\n\nOtherwise the current UI with the dropdown is misleading and doesn't reflect the actual relation between user, tenant and roles. Also there was a discussion some time ago that the current form for adding user to project have to be modified as to allow selecting multiple roles instead of a single role as it is now. So with this change we have 2 places to add a role for an user to a project, but none of these does what is expected to be done.\n\nLast, but not least - the role is per project. So changing the project dropdown should change the selected value of the role dropdown accordingly. Otherwise I can imagine lots of cases of how the site operator submits undesired changes using this form ... The operator simply doesn't know what is/are the current role(s) for a given project, if they decide to change it. This kind of information is available in Project >> Modify users, and for me this is the right place to modify the roles.""}, {'account_id': 1941, 'date': '2012-07-30 01:41:07.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 5.'}, {'account_id': 1941, 'date': '2012-07-30 01:43:27.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 5:\n\nChanges made based on review comments from Tihomir.\n\nInstead of adding a role dropdown, I just added a warning message if the user does not have any role for the assigned Default Tenant.'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-07-30 01:56:35.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 5: Works for me\n\nBuild successful\n\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-merge/1123/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-docs/167/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-pep8/1256/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-python26/522/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-python27/522/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-selenium/31/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-tempest-devstack-vm/5250/testReport : SUCCESS\n'}, {'account_id': 2455, 'date': '2012-07-30 13:57:28.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 5: No score\n\nLooks good to me, but as a new 'warning' is being returned in the form on a certain condition, I think it would be nice to have a unit test for it.""}, {'account_id': 1941, 'date': '2012-07-30 17:41:15.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 5:\n\nGot it, I'll add the check for warning message in the next patch.""}, {'account_id': 1941, 'date': '2012-07-31 05:15:16.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 6.'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-07-31 05:37:35.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 6: Works for me\n\nBuild successful\n\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-merge/1130/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-docs/174/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-pep8/1263/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-python26/529/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-python27/529/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-horizon-selenium/38/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-tempest-devstack-vm/5546/testReport : SUCCESS\n'}, {'account_id': 2455, 'date': '2012-08-09 11:07:48.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 6: Looks good to me (core reviewer)\n\n'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-08-09 19:34:10.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 6: No score\n\nStarting gate jobs.'}, {'account_id': 2458, 'date': '2012-08-09 19:34:10.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 6: Looks good to me (core reviewer);

Disabling autorebase will protect us from these kinds of accidents

There are two availability_zone related config options now:

While volume API uses node_availability_zone, the scheduler uses
the other, which causes failure in scheduler when these two options
have different values.

This patch removes 'node_availability_zone' so that end user
can specify 'availability zone' when create volumes using

Needed for blueprint disable-server-extensions

It is possible to create a wsgi resource that extends another
resource by using the same controller, but any extensions that
have been applied to the original resource will have no affect.

This adds a new parameter to ResourceExtension that allows it
to inherit extensions from another resource. This is necessary
because we are moving key funcionality of the /servers resource
into extensions, and some other resources (like create-server-ext)
extend that functionality. This way we can keep the functionality
of the other extensions.

The scheduler hints extension converts a server create request like
{'server': {'name':'foo'}, 'os:scheduler_hints': {'near': 'bar'}} to
{'server': {'name': 'foo', 'scheduler_hints': 'bar'}}. If the extension
is off, that conversion does not take place.
However, a user can explicitly set the 'scheduler_hints' value inside
the 'server' dictionary when the extension is off and the data will be
consume by the core api controller.

By place the scheduler hints into the wsgi environment, the user can't fake
any hints in the ""server"" dictionary anymore.

If a user updates an image property with purge-props, it is marked
as deleted. However, the query to filter by custom property ignores
this, and returns match even for records with deleted set. This patch
introduces a small change by inserting deleted=False in the query to
ignore those deleted properties.

Also, some changes in simpledb is introduced to handle user defined
properties in the correct format.

- Inserts deleted=False on properties filter query. Fixes bug 1025697.
- Updates simpledb to handle user defined property in correct format.

Fix bug 985184.

When creating security group rules, any case for the protocol was
accepted as input, such as TCP, Tcp, tcp, etc., and was stored in the
database as specified.  However, unless specified as all lowercase, the
code to apply the rules would break and result in some rules not being
applied.

(cherry picked from commit ff06c7c885dc94ed7c828e8cdbb8b5d850a7e654)

Also includes backport of thix fix:

Along the way I discovered that there are a number of things missing:\n1. When using quantum client the subnet does not show the dhcp state. You need to address this by adding treatment to _make_subnet_dict in the file db_base_plugin_v2.py\n2. I was a bit confused - in the blue print it states that the flag should be used by the network. Here you have used the flag on the subnets (which I think is better). I think that you should update the blueprint and maybe add a little more explanation in the commit message.\n\nThinking forward quantum will enable additional services, for example firewall, load balancing etc. Do you think that there is a generic way of adding this support instead of having a new flag for each service. This may help us with database upgrades in the future.\n\nThanks\nGary""}, {'account_id': 1653, 'date': '2012-08-08 03:38:54.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 2:\n\nHi,\nYou do not see the enable-dhcp because you need to add this to the subnet-dictionary.\nPlease look at _make_subnet_dict (line 605 I think) in quantum/db/db_base_plugin_v2.py. \nYou just need to add the line:\n               'enable_dhcp': subnet['enable_dhcp']}\nThis will show it in the quantum client.

The usage guide doesn\'t contain enable-dhcp, that\'s what I meant that you might need to change the quantum client.\n\nFor the second part, I know that nova uses db migration extensively. At a very high level (and to my very limited understanding), different versions of nova uses different models thus db schemas. If you run a later version, there is a somewhat automated way to migrate the old version of db to a new version. That\'s what I am referring to. This seems directly applicable to what you were mentioning, if I got your question correctly...\n\n-Simon'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-08-08 03:38:54.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 3: Works for me\n\nBuild successful\n\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-merge/969/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-docs/221/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-pep8/841/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-python26/610/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-python27/611/testReport : SUCCESS\n'}, {'account_id': 2531, 'date': '2012-08-08 03:38:54.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 3.'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-08-08 03:38:54.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 4: Works for me\n\nBuild successful\n\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-merge/972/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-docs/224/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-pep8/844/consoleFull : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-python26/613/testReport : SUCCESS\n- https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-quantum-python27/614/testReport : SUCCESS\n'}, {'account_id': 447, 'date': '2012-08-08 03:38:54.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't merge this\n\n(3 inline comments)\n\nOverall, I think the code looks pretty good.

If the master and the slave glance have different permissions, you
can end up with a 409 exception at upload. For example:

 - the image is visible to the replication user on the master
 - the image is present on the slave, but not visible to the
   replication user

The replicator checks for the existance of the image by doing a HEAD
on http://server:port/v1/images/uuid and gets a 404 back. It therefore
decides the image doesn't exist and that it should be replicated. It
does a POST for that URL, and gets a 409 back saying that UUID is
already in use.

Bug #1030180

We first lookup the resource id via id if it looks like an id.
If we cannot find it via id, we will look it up via name.
All of the update/show/delete support reference resource via name or id.
To create port/subnet, we can refercen network via network's name.
Also in port creation, we support reference subnet in fixed_ip via its name.

quantum_test.sh is added to test the command lines after running 'python setup.py install'

At some point IV parameter has been removed making these functions
dangerous to use unless keys are unique on every message. Since the
functions were added the original consumer has disappeared too. With
no more users it's better to get rid of the incomplete encryption system
entirely.

These were the only functions using pycrypto module directly, so it was

the compute manager was being converted over to taking an instance
instead of instance_uuid as a parameter.  Now that all methods that use
this decorator have been converted, the code can be simplified.

The _get_lock() method was updated to only look up an instance from the

Updates the Glance DB's is_image_sharable function so that
an admin can share an image regardless of the context ownership.

This fixes issues when trying to write Glance functional tests
which use the noauth middleware (UnauthenticatedContextMiddleware).

The motivation behind this change is I'd like to write some
functional tests for image-members that work with noauth.

This patch adds several options to allow using OpenVZ virt layer.
- modifies stack.sh and stackrc to recognize a new VIRT_TYPE option
- set IMAGE_URLS to an openvz image, if VIRT_TYPE == openvz

It also makes a few changes to some tests so that some implicit
defaults (such as the guest user account) can be overridden.

The change to add persistent volumes for tgtd 1ba3dfec,
passes parameters as '--conf %s' % volume_path,
'--update %s' % vol_id etc. which cause the tgt-admin command
to fail silently because the options are misquoted.

Instead pass as '--conf', volume_path

Adds an is_loaded method to the extension manager and passes
the extension manager to the servers controller so that it
can be used to enable optional post parameters.

The extension manager is also saved in ExtensionDescriptors
because they may need access to it if they are subclassing
the servers Controller.

Tests are included to verify that extension loading can be
properly determined.

Solve the race condition described in the bug 872558 report which can
result in:

- thread crashing trying to remove semaphore from dict
- two threads getting different semaphores for the same name

First case is solved automatically by weakref dictionary. No explicit
deletion takes place.
The second case is solved by getting existing or new semaphore in one
step. Once a local reference to the semaphore is obtained, it can be
safely assigned to the dictionary if it's missing. If it's present, it
will not be removed anymore because there's at least one strong
reference present (local variable 'sem').

This solution is only valid for greenthreads.

related to blueprint disable-server-extensions

The alias for extensions should start with os- where possible.
Unfortunately the alias is used for xml namespacing in some cases
so it cannot be made consistent for some legacy extensions

There will continue to be a small number of output extensions that
have no special namespace because they were added before we started
namespacing extensions and they need to remain the same for legacy
compatibility.

In the future all extensions should include a namespace prefix
when adding extra data to the api.

Currently if you restart the server running nova-volume
or restart tgt, you will loose your iscsi targets that
have been created. This is not good.

In order for iscsi targets to be persistent across
reboots or restarts, one has to have the target's configuration
information in /etc/tgt/targets.conf or /etc/tgt/conf.d.
So when tgtd is restarted then the iscsi targets will be there
as expected.

This patch will add a configuration file to $state_path/volumes
when the volume is created. The configuration file is identified by
the volume uuid. It creates a logicalunit when the volume is created
as well. The iscsi target and configuration file
will be removed once the volume has been removed as well.

In order to use this, you have to include the following in
your /etc/tgt/targets.conf

include $state_path/volumes/*

For upgrades, it will just re-create the volumes
already in the volumes table.

A simple solution for bug 1008866. When creating volume from snapshot on
multicluster, in volume it will check if snapshot_id is set. If snapshot_id
is set, make the call create volume directly to the volume host where the
snapshot resides instead of passing it through the scheduler. So snapshot can
be copy to new volume.

fixes bug 1033428
Kill dnsmasq processes on startup like n-net case.

q-dhcp(quantum dhcp agent) forks dns-masq child processes.
But those dns-masq processes are not killed on initialization unlike n-net.
So non-first run of q-dhcp fails due to stale dns-masq process.

to be registered using an @register() decorator.  One consequence is
