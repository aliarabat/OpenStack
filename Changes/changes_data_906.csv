Sometimes the main thread starts before the spawned thread, which means
that the thread that is supposed to hold open a connection starts after
the main thread has already successfully made a connection. This means
that the test for a successful connection attempt[1] was nearly useless
since the main thread would get the connection first and activate it[2]
no matter how long the spawned thread waited, and the test for a failed
connection attempt[3] would intermittently fail since is sometimes able
to get the connection before the busy-waiting worker thread does.
Adding a short sleep in the main thread ensures that the main thread
yields to the worker thread and it can grab the connection first so we
can actually test what happens in the main thread.

As reported at bug/1546067, expirer might accidentally deletes an object
which is created after x-delete-at timestamp. This is because expirer
sends a request with ""X-Timestamp: <current_timestamp>"" and tombstone
is named as <requested_x_timestamp>.ts so if object creation time is
between x-delete-at and expirer's DELETE request x-timestamp, the object
might be hidden by tombstone.

This possibility can be simply removed if the value of x-timestamp which
an expirer sends is the same timestamp as x-delete-at of an actual object.
Namely, expirer pretends to delete an object at the time an user really
wants to delete it.

The unit tests
    test_deallocate_for_instance_2_with_requested
    test_deallocate_for_instance_2
in
    nova.tests.unit.network.test_neutronv2.TestNeutronv2
fail randomly. An example error looks like this:

    b'mox3.mox.UnexpectedMethodCallError: Unexpected method call.
    unexpected:- expected:+'
    b""- Client.delete_port('my_portid1') -> None""
    b'? ^'
    b""+ Client.delete_port('my_portid2') -> None""
    b'?

This is due to the mox record with expected the deletion of multiple
ports on an instance in a specific order. This order is not important
though and also not the same in each test case execution. To make it
explicit in the test case, that the order is *not* important, I've
chosen to define that in the mock records with ""InAnyOrder()"".

Another solution could have been to ensure the order of the port IDs
through the unit tests, but that could be interpreted as a precondition
for the functional code to work correctly, which is a wrong assumption
and therefore not chosen for this fix.

The git_diff method is currently only used for listing requirements
changes, and that's actually hard-coded into the method itself
with the header it uses before running the git diff command.

This makes the method more generic and adds a specific method
for dumping requirements changes.

The hope is to build on this by adding code that parses the
requirements diff output looking for new dependencies added
in stable branch release requests so we can fail those types
of backports.

best we can do for Centos7.

Fedora 24 has split languages out into packages so we don't have to do
this, but I have not dealt with that yet.  A guard is put in place so
we make sure we revisit this when we try to build F24.

this was wrong and installing EPEL6 on centos7.

When the proxy is handling an object GET response and an object server
fails to send data in a timely fashion, the proxy can pick up where it
left off with another object server; other than a pause in the
download, the client doesn't even know anything happened.

However, if the proxy received the GET response headers but no data,
it would resume at the wrong spot. In particular, for an N-byte
object, it would ask the second object server for the last N-1 bytes
(or equivalently, all but the first byte). For a replicated storage
policy, this would result in the client getting an abbreviated
download, while for an EC storage policy, the proxy would 500 after
trying to decode a fragment set with a bogus fragment in it.

This commit fixes the resumption logic to ask for all N bytes of the
object from the second object server.

If you have a master and a slave configured and you insert
new data into the master, it will cause subsequent replica
create to fail.

The problem is that we weren't setting the gtid_purged variable
using the metadata in the xtrabackup_binlog_info file. The
Mysql GTID replication strategy was adjusted to account for this.

A release note has been added.

The replication scenario tests were enhanced to validate this
issue.

Note: this issue doesn't occur with MariaDB GTID replication
because it mechanism is different.

Scenario tests were run succesfully on Mysql, Percona and
MariaDB with this change in place.

Service commands may take some time to return.
The current code does not pass any timeout value into the execute
function resulting in the default 30s value being used.
That value turns out to be too short for certain datastores
(Cassandra) on slower/heavily-loaded systems.

Trove already has a timeout (default=3min) for instance state changes that
should be used instead (this timeout has already been used when
polling for database states).

The service command execute function have been updated to accept an
optional timeout kwargs (like the shell command execute function).
The state change timeout is now being passed in from DB
start/stop/restart calls.

Following fd86d5a, the object-auditor would leave status files so it
could resume where it left off if restarted. However, this would also
cause the object-reconstructor to print warnings like:

  Unexpected entity in data dir: u'/srv/node4/sdb8/objects/auditor_status_ZBF.json'

...which isn't actually terribly useful or actionable. The auditor will
clean it up (eventually); the operator doesn't have to do anything.

Now, the reconstructor will specifically ignore those status files.

The scenario tests need to have the group classes broken
up to allow interleaving of the different parts of the tests
so that the gate can finish in a reasonable amount of time.

The runners, however, need to be the same for each main group,
thus allowing state to be preserved between groups of the same
feature.  The creation of runners was refactored to allow for this.

The module tests were also modified to use the new paradym, which
allowed the removal of the global varaibles in the runner.

Dependencies on tests.api were also removed.

When performing instance evacuation (which is essentially ""rebuild an
instance elsewhere""), image metadata is not persistent -- this manifests
only when instances are on shared storage.

So, supply the original instance metadata to 'image_meta' parameter,
instead of an empty dict.

Liberty notes (compared to upstream Newton/Mitaka):

  - We get the image metadata from the instance object's
    system_metadata.
  - We're modifying the tests
    'test_rebuild_on_host_with_shared_storage()' and
    'test_on_shared_storage_not_provided_host_with_shared_storage()' to
    exercise the code change.

This patch moves the assignment abstract base class out of core and into
backends/base.py

This removes dependencies where backend code references code in the
core. The reasoning being that the core should know about the backend
interface, but the backends should not know anything about the core
(separation of concerns). And part of the risk here is a potential for
circular dependencies.

DeploySelectedNodesWithTasks is intended to run only specified set of
tasks on specified nodes. In Fuel 9.0 LCM serializers have been
introduced, hence tasks are skipped if their condition return 'False'
(and it does, since no changes may introduced).

This introduces inconvenience for operators, who want to run particular
task on nodes and do not care if there were changes or not. That's why
this commit introduces the '?force' HTTP parameter for the mentioned
handler. If 'force' is true, the task will be executed unconditionally.

In testing the fix for this, it became apparent that the code for
configuring guest images was never workable; the TOKEN variable was
never really initialized.

Both issues have been addressed.

If one uses only a single replica and a database file is placed on a
wrong partition, it will be removed instead of replicated to the correct
partition.

There are two reasons for this:
1. The list of nodes is empty when there is only a single replica
2. all(responses) is True even if there is no response at all, and the
latter is always True if there is no node to replicate to.

This patch fixes this by adding a special case if used with only one
replica to the node selection loop and ensures that the list of
responses is not empty.  Also adds a test that fails on current master
and passes with this change.

Keystone team decided to deprecate API v2.0 on Mitaka,
since the API v3 it's now the stable API version, this
patch change the devstack gate to be voting.

This patch is part of the plan on this etherpad:
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/v3-only-devstack

Besided that, we investigate a couple of issues related to this point
and in a few points, we need to work on:

* Lack of ""v3 only"" jobs on gates (job on Tempest and Devstack be
  voting, create other service v3 only jobs)
* V3 only devstack fails in some projects like Ironic;
* Lack of keystoneauth session usage in some service clients;
* Delete the Hardcoded v2.0 usage like using v2 url, tenant variables;
* Remove the Keystone CLI usage, like in Nova gate;
* Change v2.0 service tokens to be v3: Hardwritten, automated tools
* OpenStack Client Config
* Add v3 operations tests in Tempest

If you have a master and a slave configured and you insert
new data into the master, it will cause subsequent replica
create to fail.

The problem is that we weren't setting the gtid_purged variable
using the metadata in the xtrabackup_binlog_info file. The
Mysql GTID replication strategy was adjusted to account for this.

A release note has been added.

The replication scenario tests were enhanced to validate this
issue.

Note: this issue doesn't occur with MariaDB GTID replication
because it mechanism is different.

Scenario tests were run succesfully on Mysql, Percona and
MariaDB with this change in place.

Fedora is transitioning from use of 'yum' to 'dnf'.
While yum is still available in F22 and F23, it has

DeploySelectedNodesWithTasks is intended to run only specified set of
tasks on specified nodes. In Fuel 9.0 LCM serializers have been
introduced, hence tasks are skipped if their condition return 'False'
(and it does, since no changes may introduced).

This introduces inconvenience for operators, who want to run particular
task on nodes and do not care if there were changes or not. That's why
this commit introduces the '?force' HTTP parameter for the mentioned
handler. If 'force' is true, the task will be executed unconditionally.

Rewrite server side copy and 'object post as copy' feature as middleware to
simplify the PUT method in the object controller code. COPY is no longer
a verb implemented as public method in Proxy application.

The server side copy middleware is inserted to the left of dlo, slo and
versioned_writes middlewares in the proxy server pipeline. As a result,
dlo and slo copy_hooks are no longer required. SLO manifests are now
validated when copied so when copying a manifest to another account the
referenced segments must be readable in that account for the manifest
copy to succeed (previously this validation was not made, meaning the
manifest was copied but could be unusable if the segments were not
readable).

With this change, there should be no change in functionality or existing
behavior. This is asserted with (almost) no changes required to existing
functional tests.

Some notes (for operators):
* Middleware required to be auto-inserted before slo and dlo and
  versioned_writes
* Turning off server side copy is not configurable.
* object_post_as_copy is no longer a configurable option of proxy server
  but of this middleware. However, for smooth upgrade, config option set
  in proxy server app is also read.

DocImpact: Introducing server side copy as middleware

CPU metrics are reported as a normalized value in [0,1].
When scheduler reads the data as MonitorMetric object, as part
of update_from_compute_node(), the value of the metric gets
lost due to a wrong type conversion, typecasting into an Integer,
reduces it to 0.

Note:
 - It may seem unintuitive that to fix the same, we are not changing
   the type of metric from Integer to Float. Please refer the
   discussions -
   * https://review.openstack.org/#/c/243825/
   * https://review.openstack.org/#/c/216923/
 - To summarize, we are trying to save some 'possible' downstream consumer
   of metrics updates from compute nodes, i.e. consuming from AMPQ, from
   software upgrade scenarios.

When performing instance evacuation (which is essentially ""rebuild an
instance elsewhere""), image metadata is not persistent -- this manifests
only when instances are on shared storage.

So, supply the original instance metadata to 'image_meta' parameter,
instead of an empty dict.

Liberty notes (compared to upstream Newton/Mitaka):

  - We get the image metadata from the instance object's
    system_metadata.
  - We're modifying the tests
    'test_rebuild_on_host_with_shared_storage()' and
    'test_on_shared_storage_not_provided_host_with_shared_storage()' to
    exercise the code change.

Take a list of Inventory objects associated with a resource provider
and update, create or delete as necessary. Do it it all in one
transaction.

This involves a few steps:

* get a list of a existing inventories for this provider to compare
  with the incoming list
* get the resources for the provider to have access to current
  'used' information
* merge incoming inventory data into existing inventories so they
  can be save(d)
* inventories that don't yet exist, create()
* existing inventories that don't have incoming inventory,
  destroy()

This has been done on ResourceProvider instead of InventoryList
because access to 'used' information (via
resource_provider.resources) should be in the same transaction
as everything else, lest we race.

This introduces inconvenience for operators, who want to run particular

this commit introduces the '?force' HTTP parameter for the mentioned

This commit does the following to doc/source/shell-examples.rst:

- updates designate examples to pass in --os-token, which according to
  my tests is necessary when Designate is configured with 'noauth'
- updates some spelling and grammatical errors

Additionally, this commit updates
designateclient/functionaltests/client.py to use ``--os-endpoint``
instead of ``--os-url``, which according to what I can see is not a
valid option.

Addresses TODO's in decrypter. Rearrange exception
handling in attempt to have single point of validating
decryption and single point of validating keys, which
resulted in some refactoring.

- rename decrypter.get_sysmeta_crypto_meta to get_crypto_meta
  because it used with both sysmeta and transient-sysmeta
- rename crypto_utils.get_crypto_meta to create_crypto_meta
  since that is what it does
- move load_crypto_meta and dump_crypto_meta to crypto_utils
- remove a try/except pass because load_crypto_meta does not
  raise valueError or TypeError
- only make a decryption context when it will be used - before we
  made one that would not be used if we then went on to use a
  multipart response iter, which makes its own decrypt contexts.
- move as much checking out of iters because they do not execute
  until the first call to their next - in particular check
  crypto_meta before instantiating the multipart response body.
- consolidate all decryption checking and exception raising into
  _load_crypto_meta
- check keys are valid when they are first read from keymaster
- add unit tests for get_keys()
- raise 500 error if x-object-sysmeta-crypto-etag is present but
  not x-object-sysmeta-crypto-etag-meta
- change some 500 response bodies to have general message that
  do not expose internal implementaiton details to clients.

During summit session with Murano team there was decision about developing
group of applications separately and renaming old repository murano-apps to
example-murano-apps. Current repository will be used for developing
group of Murano applications, which allow to create easily reproducable
ci-cd pipeline. It will be some separate applications (Jenkins, Gerrit)
and also all in one applications (Jenkins+Gerrit).

The purpose of current project is to develop and maintain applications
mentioned above. So this project is not a Murano development, it's about
development specific applications, which can be used by Murano.

Add the ability to set the fallocate_reserve value as a percentage.
This happens automatically when adding the '%' at the end of the value.
Having the ability to set a % of free space rather than a byte value is
useful especially when drive sizes are heterogenous.

The default for fallocate_reserve has been adjusted to 1%, having the
fallocate_reserve set seems sensible for all deploys and percentages are
far safer to default than byte values (across drives of any size).

Tests added for using fallocate_reserve as a percentage.

Duplicate tests for fallocate_reserve have been removed.

Docs updated to reflect the fallocate_reserve change.

at https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil,
TestMultiprocessing.test_interrupt_avoids_respawn_storm fails when
building the Debian package of Glance. This is due to the fact that
our gate has an upper bound on an antic version of psutil, when
distributions have upgraded a long time ago. This patch fixes it by
switching from process.get_children() to process.children() and
catch the exception to ensure it still continues to work in the gate.

Only use PyCrypto/PyCryptodome work-around with Paramiko 1.x and use
straight-forward Paramiko interface with 2.x.

TODO: Revert this and PyCrypto/PyCryptodome work-around when Paramiko
is upgraded to 2.x (ie replace `generate_keys(bits)` call with
`paramiko.RSAKey.generate(bits)`).

Change If88beeb3983705621fe736995939ac20b2daf1f3 added a work-around
for the partially-PyCrypto-compatible PyCryptodome causing Paramiko,
which has a dependency on PyCrypto, to break.  This work-around
entails implementing Paramiko internals (ie how to generate a key) in
Nova in a way compatible with both PyCrypto and PyCryptodom.

This work-around is itself a source of failure with Paramiko 2 which
has replaced the PyCrypto requirement with the cryptography Python
package.  As Paramiko no longer depends on PyCrypto, Nova doesn't have
an explicit PyCrypto requirement, and there's no implicit dependency
on PyCrypto, when Nova tries to import PyCrypto it fails.  Even if
PyCrypto was installed, the work-around would still fail because the
Paramiko interface that Nova is using as part of the work-around
changed with the major version change (ie 1.x => 2.x).

Recently, oslo.messaging does a refactor [1] which causes
get_batch_notification_listener returns a new type
BatchNotificationServer instead of previous MessageHandlingServer,
they have different attributes, so our test code which relies on
MessageHandlingServer fails in CI gate.

This patch makes test code not rely on oslo.messaging details.

The access_ips and disk_config extensions extend more than just
servers. However, the way that code was hyper optimized with aliases
it made understanding that fact a lot harder. This removes method
aliases and instead uses single line methods that call to common
components. This means that argument names for the methods make sense,
and that 'git grep ""def server_update""' will return these when trying
to figure out what controllers extend server update.

DNS Python broke the dns.zone.from_text() method

It now requires an extra parameter (the origin of the
zone), and we do not have that information when we
call into dnspython.

Previously the origin was taken from the $ORIGIN
statement in the zone file, and we relyed on this
to parse the name of the zone when we run an
import.

Rewrite server side copy and 'object post as copy' feature as middleware to
simplify the PUT method in the object controller code. COPY is no longer
a verb implemented as public method in Proxy application.

The server side copy middleware is inserted to the left of dlo, slo and
versioned_writes middlewares in the proxy server pipeline. As a result,
dlo and slo copy_hooks are no longer required. SLO manifests are now
validated when copied so when copying a manifest to another account the
referenced segments must be readable in that account for the manifest
copy to succeed (previously this validation was not made, meaning the
manifest was copied but could be unusable if the segments were not
readable).

With this change, there should be no change in functionality or existing
behavior. This is asserted with (almost) no changes required to existing
functional tests.

Some notes (for operators):
* Middleware required to be auto-inserted before slo and dlo and
  versioned_writes
* Turning off server side copy is not configurable.
* object_post_as_copy is no longer a configurable option of proxy server
  but of this middleware. However, for smooth upgrade, config option set
  in proxy server app is also read.

When a port has been added to router namespace, trying to replace the
port by adding del-port and add-port in one command, will not bring
the new port to kernel. Even if the port is updated in ovs db and can
be found on br-int, system can't see the new port. This will break
the following actions, which will manipulate the new port by ip
commands. A mail list has been filed to discuss this issue at [1].

The problem here will break the scenario that namespace is deleted
unexpectedly, and l3-agent tries to rebuild the namespace at restart.

Separating replace_port to two commands: del-port and add-port,
matches the original logic and has been verified that it can resolve
the problem here.

This fixes the IP driver update_allocation_pools to use
the session on the subnet rather than generating a new one.
Generating a new one was causing the allocation pool
creation to be uncommitted since nothing was ever starting
a transaction on the session before it added allocation pool
objects to the session. This resulted in them never being
committed to the database so the subnet would become unusable
after an update.

This also adds a very simple unit test to ensure the
subnet still works after an update.

The DB models define project_id and user_id as Column String fields of
255 characters because historically they weren't wasn't necessarily
UUIDs, but when we created the Versioned Object counterparts of the ORM<
models we forced them to be UUIDs, which will create problems for any
deployment where any of them is not using UUIDs.

We know cases where this is a problem for the project_id, moreover now
that Oslo Versioned Objects library is going to enforce the use of UUIDs
in UUIDFields.

This patch changes those fields to make them of StringField type as they
should have been all along.

This change has no implications on the serialization, so we don't need
to bump versions, we can simply change the hash in the test.

The 'isolate' policy is supposed to function on both hosts with an
SMT architecture (e.g. HyperThreading) and those without. The former
is true, but the latter is broken due to a an underlying implementation
detail in how vCPUs are ""packed"" onto pCPUs.

The '_pack_instance_onto_cores' function expects to work with a list of
sibling sets. Since non-SMT hosts don't have siblings, the function is
being given a list of all cores as one big sibling set. However, this
conflicts with the idea that, in the 'isolate' case, only one sibling
from each sibling set should be used. Using one sibling from the one
available sibling set means it is not possible to schedule instances
with more than one vCPU.

Resolve this mismatch by instead providing the function with a list of
multiple sibling sets, each containing a single core.

This also resolves another bug. When booting instances on a non-HT
host, the resulting NUMA topology should not define threads. By
correctly considering the cores on these systems as non-siblings,
the resulting instance topology will contain multiple cores with only
a single thread in each.

Nova barbican keymgr uses keystone client's endpoint discovery feature. As per
current nova usage, this discovery logic does not work so either barbican
endpoint has to have version in its service catalog endpoint data or it raises
the error mentioned in related bug.
Keystone team recommends to store only base URL (without version) in service
catalog data. So to keystone version discovery to work correctly, version
argument needs to be passed to keystoneclient session#get_endpoint call. And
with this change, versioned endpoint is returned via above call now.
