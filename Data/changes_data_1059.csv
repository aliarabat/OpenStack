When using Neutron-powered networking (vs. Nova-Networks) an instance
can have more than one floating IP assigned to it, but since Horizon
retrieves list of instance's IPs from Nova which doesn't distinguish
between private and floating IPs, it's hard to offer user a choice
which floating IP to disassociate in Instances table.

A different approach is chosen: when the user presses 'Disassociate
IP' button, he is redirected to Access&Security->Floating IPs tab,
where he sees only floating IPs that are linked to the instance which
IP he's disassociating. To make this happen, a hidden FilterAction is
added to Floating IPs table, and the redirect link contains filter
query which is applied once we at Floating IPs table.

There is a case that unintentional volume is detached from instance
in terminate instance API.
Because in _shutdown_instance(), all volume block device mapping is
collected and detached by the condition of volume id.
So, if instance has redundant volume block device mapping which made
by attaching failure, terminate instance API detach another volume.
This patch checks consistency of detaching volume and instance
between nova and cinder.

Also this patch moves get_volume_connector() call out of loop
to avoid unnecessary multiple calls.

One missing piece here however is that we have no way to
populate this data for existing deployments if/when they
upgrade.

This patch provides a simple solution that issues an update
call to the drivers on host init.  It works by fetching a
list of volumes for the specific host, and passes those in
to the driver.  The driver can do nothing, or it can go
through and sync up the Cinder ID's with it's internal
ID's and return the provider update info.

With the reference implementation, there exists a problem when using
'nova-interface-attach' using 'net-id' parameter. The neutron port
created for this operation does not inherit the instance's security-groups,
but instead uses just the 'default' security-group.

The proposed fix is to use the instance's security-groups when allocating
port for the instance.

However, if port-security extension is present and port-security-enabled
is set to False for the network on which we are trying to attach interface,
then the code had a check to raise an error. This patch removes the code
raising that error and instead does not use the passed security-groups
when creating a port in such a network.

  - there is no rabbit resources running or no master
  - the list of rabbit resources being started/promoted
    reported empty
* For such cases, do not report resource failure and delegate

'max_rabbitmqctl_timeouts'. By default it is set to 1, i.e. rabbitmqctl
timeouts are not tolerated at all.

Bug #1487517 is fixed by extracting declaration of local variables
'rc_alarms' and 'rc_queues' from assignment operations.


Text for Operations Guide:

If on node where RabbitMQ is deployed
other processes consume significant part of CPU, RabbitMQ starts
responding slow to queries by 'rabbitmqctl' utility. The utility is
used by RabbitMQ's OCF script to monitor state of the RabbitMQ.
When utility fails to return in pre-defined timeout, OCF script
considers RabbitMQ to be down and restarts it, which might lead to
a limited (several minutes) OpenStack downtime. Such restarts
are undesirable as they cause downtime without benefit. To
mitigate the issue, the OCF script might be told to tolerate
certain amount of rabbitmqctl timeouts in a row using the following
command:
  crm_resource --resource p_rabbitmq-server --set-parameter \
      max_rabbitmqctl_timeouts --parameter-value N

Here N should be replaced with the number of timeouts. For instance,
if it is set to 3, the OCF script will tolerate two rabbitmqctl
timeouts in a row, but fail if the third one occurs.

By default the parameter is set to 1, i.e. rabbitmqctl timeout is not
tolerated at all. The downside of increasing the parameter is that
if a real issue occurs which causes rabbitmqctl timeout, OCF script
will detect that only after N monitor runs and so the restart, which
might fix the issue, will be delayed.

To understand that RabbitMQ's restart was caused by rabbitmqctl timeout
you should examine lrmd.log of the corresponding controller on Fuel
master node in /var/log/docker-logs/remote/ directory. Here lines like
""the invoked command exited 137: /usr/sbin/rabbitmqctl list_channels ...""

indicate rabbitmqctl timeout. The next line will explain if it
caused restart or not. For example:
""rabbitmqctl timed out 2 of max. 3 time(s) in a row. Doing nothing for now.""

When rbd is used for ephemeral disks and image storage, we can avoid
local disk by doing the snapshot with ceph, and sending the location
of it to glance.

At this point glance is effectively the owner of the snapshot, and
nova cannot delete the original disk, so a corresponding change to
glance is needed to handle this cleanup later, when the snapshot is
deleted.

To accomplish this, create an rbd clone and store the clone's location
in glance, and when nova deletes an rbd disk with snapshots, rename
the disk to include a marker that glance looks for to know they can be
deleted when glance deletes the snapshots.

This requires changing the typical permissions for the glance ceph
user to allow writing to the pool where vm images are stored.

DocImpact: glance will need write access to rbd to delete snapshots

Let's say you have some code like this:

        # [setup code goes here]
        with mock.patch(""swift.obj.auditor.os.wait"", fake_os_wait), \

             mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):
            my_auditor.run_once()

pep8 will complain about this with a pair of messages like this: ""E127
continuation line over-indented for visual indent"", plus some line
numbers. It's complaining about the indentations of the second and
third lines in the 'with' clause.

Okay, so it's over-indented. Let's indent it less.

        with mock.patch(""swift.obj.auditor.os.wait"", fake_os_wait), \
           mock.patch.object(my_auditor, 'fork_child', fake_fork_child), \
           mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):
            my_auditor.run_once()

Now it's uglier, and pep8 still says it's over-indented. Keep going:

        with mock.patch(""swift.obj.auditor.os.wait"", fake_os_wait), \
          mock.patch.object(my_auditor, 'fork_child', fake_fork_child), \
          mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):

            my_auditor.run_once()

Still no. Different error this time, though.

Okay, let's try adding some spaces to see if that'll make it less...

              mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):
            my_auditor.run_once()

Nope. You sick of this yet? I sure am.

        with mock.patch(""swift.obj.auditor.os.wait"", fake_os_wait), \
               mock.patch.object(my_auditor, 'fork_child', fake_fork_child), \
               mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):
            my_auditor.run_once()

ARGH

        with mock.patch(""swift.obj.auditor.os.wait"", fake_os_wait), \
                mock.patch.object(my_auditor, 'fork_child', fake_fork_child), \
                mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):
            my_auditor.run_once()

Three spaces works! Hallelujah! How about four?

        with mock.patch(""swift.obj.auditor.os.wait"", fake_os_wait), \
                 mock.patch.object(my_auditor, 'fork_child', fake_fork_child), \
                 mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):
            my_auditor.run_once()

BAHAHA no.

Got it? When pep8 says that a continuation line is over-indented, you
need to add exactly three spaces. Three shall be the number thou shalt
count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou
not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to
three. Five is right out.

This commit blacklists E127 so nobody else has to waste time on this
garbage.

When it gets to submitting & reviewing patches for the project documentation,
it is very convenient to surf through the docs generated by Sphinx in a special
Gate job. The problem is that Sphinx uses in gates a theme which is different
from that used on ReadTheDocs. So the docs generated in gates look differently
from the docs that we have on ReadTheDocs, while the desired behaviour is to
have the same Sphinx theme both on ReadTheDocs and in gates.

There is a snippet that enables this theme for Sphinx locally (and so in gates):
http://paste.openstack.org/show/156901/

This is really grasping at straws but commit ef9dedb2f which introduced
this code in the guest module changed passing flags from a positional
argument to a kwarg and we're wondering if that is somehow messing up
how PyArg_ParseTuple is handling this - like maybe the underlying
libvirt just never gets called.

Also adds return code checking on attachDeviceFlags since if it's not
failing and raising libvirtError, we want to make sure it's at least
returning 0, and not something unexpected like None.

Log the flags while we're at it.

Existing rsync stop/start handlers were relying on the pattern
parameter to the Ansible service module which relies on the results
of ps to determine if the service is running. This is unnecessary
because the rsync service script is well-behaved and responds
appropriately to start stop and restart commands. Removal of the
pattern param ensures that the response from the service command is
used instead.

Root cause of the bug is that when Keystone was changed to share
fernet secrets via rsync over ssh tunnel, an rsync process was
introduced in AIOs, Swift stand-alones, and other deployment
configurations that contain Keystone containers on the storage hosts.

The resulting rsync processes within Keystone containers pollute the
results of ps commands on the host, fooling Ansible into thinking
that an rsync service is running on the standard port when it is not.

Secondly, the handler responsible for stopping rsync was not causing
the notice for ""Ensure rsync service running"" to trigger cleanly in
my testing, so the tasks were changed to trigger both notices in an
ordered list.

When nova is used without shared_storage and glance doesn't have the
images required by the instance anymore, the live block migration code
can't prepare the destination host properly.

This patch catches the case when images are not found in glance, and
copies the missing images from the source host, like the
migrate_disk_and_power_off code already does.

The KVM disk deep copy method is not used because it won't work for AMI
image that depends of AKI/ARI image. kernel and initrd are not considered
by the kvm disk migration because they are readonly file (by the kvm pov)
used only to boot the VM.

The CommandRunner used to run commands using su command and passing the
actual command to be run as argument to it.

su USER -c <cmd>

This is susceptible to command line injection as noted in the bug.

The fix required to do two things:

1. Pass the command to be run as list instead of a string. This is to
ensure that the actual arguments are passed as arguments to the program
ought to be executed. And by doing so, avoids running any commands
passed in the argument. On the contrary, if the command were passed as a
string to the shell, the arguments could be formed in a way to execute
malicious commands.

2. The CommandRunner runs the command directly and uses setuid to lower
the privileges if needed. If the 'runas' user is other than root, then
its UID is obtained and setuid is invoked to set the real user-id and
effective user-id to the given user.

This patch does that. If Nova service doesn't suport the required
microversion, ec2-api uses the last microvertions the service supports.
But do not switch to v2 or v2.1 with no microversions at all. This will
be useful for a future cases, when ec2-api uses new features with their
own microversions.

Functional tests job are broken. This change proposes add post

post_test_hook function in devstack gate.

The benefit from this approach is it will immediately pick up

to see the change breaks tests or not w/o merging related

post_test_hook runs functional tests and generate testr results

Created the clustering implementation for Percona XtraDB Cluster
Server. Used the existing framework for adding a new cluster strategy
for percona. Created guestagent, api, and taskmanager calls to setup
the cluster.

Ran into a weird issue where creating the admin user was not being
saved even though there was no error logged. I believe this was
happening because mysql was technically up from the mysqladmin ping
cmd but was not processing the grant call yet. I've heard that to be
sure you should run a 'select 1;' call to verify that mysql is really
ready after starting it. I added a method to verify this.

PXC needs a few more ports opened up for the group comm, state
transfer, and incremental state transfer. Added the percona
cluster.cnf template file for the setting needed in PXC. When a
joining instance first joins the cluster it syncs all the data using
xtrabackup, this will cause the joining instance to lose its admin
user os_admin. So we reset the admin to a new password across the
board.

Make Percona Xtradb Cluster a different datastore because there are
muliple version of PXC. This has been tested with pxc 5.5 from the
ubuntu repository.

It used to be that a GET of a tempurl referencing a large object would
let you download that large object regardless of where its segments
lived. However, this led to some violated user expectations around
container tempurls.

(Note on shorthand: all tempurls reference objects. However, ""account
tempurl"" and ""container tempurl"" are shorthand meaning tempurls
generated using a key on the account or container, respectively.)

Let's say an application is given tempurl keys to a particular
container, and it does all its work therein using those keys. The user
expects that, if the application is compromised, then the attacker
only gains access to the ""compromised-container"". However, with the old
behavior, the attacker could read data from *any* container like so:

1) Choose a ""victim-container"" to download

2) Create PUT and GET tempurl for any object name within the
   ""compromised-container"". The object doesn't need to exist;
   we'll create it.

3) Using the PUT tempurl, upload a DLO manifest with
   ""X-Object-Manifest: /victim-container/""

4) Using the GET tempurl, download the object created in step 3. The
   result will be the concatenation of all objects in the
   ""victim-container"".

Step 3 need not be for all objects in the ""victim-container""; for
example, a value ""X-Object-Manifest: /victim-container/abc"" would only
be the concatenation of all objects whose names begin with ""abc"". By
probing for object names in this way, individual objects may be found
and extracted.

A similar bug would exist for manifests referencing other accounts
except that neither the X-Object-Manifest (DLO) nor the JSON manifest
document (SLO) have a way of specifying a different account.

This change makes it so that a container tempurl only grants access to
objects within its container, *including* large-object segments. This
breaks backward compatibility for container tempurls that may have
pointed to cross container *LO's, but (a) there are security
implications, and (b) container tempurls are a relatively new feature.

This works by having the tempurl middleware install an authorization
callback ('swift.authorize' in the WSGI environment) that limits the
scope of any requests to the account or container from which the key
came.

This requires swift.authorize to persist for both the manifest request
and all segment requests; this is done by having the proxy server
restore it to the WSGI environment prior to returning from __call__.

All clients should support keystone v3 in kilo. This patch adds
support for keystone sessions, keystone endpoint discovery and support
for the CLI to provide keystone v3 options.

Bumps python-keystoneclient to >=0.11.1 to bring in session support.

This patch was previously dependent on a separate one to add session
support but that work has been squashed into this and its review
(https://review.openstack.org/#/c/131309) will be abandoned.

NOTE: This patch has already been committed and reverted twice,
because of it broke integration tests for other projects.

This is a better representation of how actual resources work.

1. implement check_*_complete
2. measure the time, not just do one sleep
3. add client_name and entity_name so we can actually talk to a service
   (even if it fails).
4. add some example usage in test_create_update.py
5. don't use json_snippet._properties

The timeout works in a similar way to the waitcondition.

This commit addresses the issue by assigning 3 different names to

Currently we cannot import source archives with names different
than expected by hardcoded line in Dockerfiles. This worked well
for Openstack services' tarballs where we expected SERVICE-* root
folder after extraction or kanaka-noVNC for nova-novncproxy docker.
The latter fails if one tries to clone or get tarball under other
names. This fix allows any archive (tar,tgz,zip) or repo name to be
imported into dockerfile.

Similar to the implementation of the manage/unmanage volume these will
need a volume_ref containing a ‘name’ key and value that matches an

Due to this requiring a rename of the snapshot it will only be available

This commit fixes the regex generation from the blacklist_file option.
Previously it was only generating an exclude regex (unless a regex was
also provided) this however wasn't working with testr. This was due
to how testr uses the regex certain regexes which just had the
lookahead exclude was not actually excluding the tests. However,
adding a real regex match fixes this issue. So this commit adds logic
to guess a regex that always matches to make the exclude portion work.
This is a hack until we can fix the testr regex filter logic to handle
just a lookahead exclude properly. (most likely need to change a
re.match to a re.search)

The RAX Repose environment is blocking access to the API version
information by local policy, returning a 401 before we even get to
Nova itself. While this in clearly incorrect behavior, it is behavior
in the field, and we should not break all our users on that cloud.

This catches the 401 and translates that so that it's the equivalent
of only supporting v2.0. We will be taking these API calls to defcore,
and intend to remove this work around once that is done.

The paste pipeline that's ""above"" the /v2/ and /v2.1/ urls is the
oscomputeversions dispatcher, which should provide 300 redirects to
versions in question. Previously the code that was trying to discover
information about the current version did so via a GET of something
that looked like /v2. On an upstream compatible OpenStack this
actually triggers a 300 and redirect to /v2/ for the real answer.

On deployed public clouds, oscomputeversions is sometimes not deployed
at all, or front end blocking by the load balancer does
weirdness. Sometimes with a 401, sometimes a hang.

This fixes the way that first request is made that should avoid the
300 redirect entirely. The code probably should have done this
originally, but it was tested with upstream configuration that worked
fine in this case.

This fix is tested against HP Cloud (the only pub cloud I have creds
with). Before this fix ""nova list"" hangs trying to get the supported
versions, after the fix it works as expected.

I have made some changes to add additional scope awareness to the
StatementBuffer class. Additional functions have been added to allow
you to retrieve the lines of the parent of a given line, or all
children of a given line. Used in combination, it is possible to
retrieve all siblings of a given line.

StatementBuffer also now holds an archive of the AST of every statement
in it's unaltered state, which can be accessed using the new get_node
function, for example calling get_node(get_parent(line_no)) will
return the parent node of the given line, which includes the AST
of that node and all child nodes. Note, all the new functions take
a line number as a parameter, and return line numbers, or an AST
node for get_node().

existing code will create queues from the cartesian product of the
set of pipelines and the set of agents. these queues are identified
by pipe_type-pipe_name-agent_id. the problem arises where if an agent
dies, any messages left on it's queue will be lost as agent_id's tend
to be unique.

this patch changes the logic so rather than using the number of agents
as the set we build our cartesian product from, we use a set of numbers
of a configurable size. by default, it will be a set of 10 so that queues
are created from the product set of the set of pipelines and the set
{0, 1, 2, 3, ... 9}. similarly, the pipelines queues will be identified
by pipe_type-pipe_name-x, where x is value from numerical set. this
way, if an agent dies, the queues are still known and can be
redistributed and processed among the active agents.

Since the plan is to attach first Mitaka scripts to Liberty branches
with down_revision, and since labels are inherited from all other

that the following commands would be valid:

neutron-db-manage upgrade mitaka_expand@<some_revision_from_liberty>

which may be confusing to users.

This bug is triggered when haproxy is deployed on multiple hosts
and external_lb_vip is different than the internal one.
As all host receive the same configuration, and are expected
to restart the haproxy service more than once
(once during role and once post_tasks), the playbook will fail,
because the restart of the service fails. The restart of the
service fails on some hosts because haproxy tries to
start/bind to an ip the host doesn't have (avoiding ip conflicts)

This allows haproxy to bind on non_local addresses by
addng a sysctl change in the playbook: net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1
The sysctl is changed for the containers/systems
when external_lb_vip is different than internal address and
the number of haproxy hosts is more than one thanks to a group_var.

Side-effect: other services are able to bind on non-local addresses
if the sysctl is changed.

This could be overriden by setting the variable haproxy_bind_on_non_local
in your user_* variables. If set to false, then the ip_non_local_bind
sysctl won't be changed.

The snmp declarative hardware pollster loads the metric definition from
a special yaml file and can poll those metrics. This enables the
developers to modify the yaml file only to add new snmp metrics without
writing any new python code.

Added a new classmethod interface build_pollsters for PollsterBase. The
pollster plugin which implements this interface should return a list of
tuple (name, pollster), where name is the meter name it will return, and
pollster is the pollster object instances. All the pollsters returned by
this would be wrapped in stevedore extensions in
PollsterBase.get_pollster_extensions().

This pollster doesn't get registered temporarily to avoid duplicating
samples. Will be registered in the following patches when old snmp
pollsters are deleted.

This patch adds a support of 'Murano Package' Glance artifact type to
the murano client. The ArtifactRepo class wraps the standard Glance's
V3 client and provides access to Glance Artifacts as to Murano
Packages.
Another class, called PackageManagerAdapter provides a temporary
facade which makes artifact-based packages compatible with the legacy
packages.

Adds an artifact type for Glance V3 to define murano package, its
specific properties and binary objects (full package, logo and a ui
definition).

As a temporary workaround to simplify search a 'keywords' field is added
to contain display name and tags word-by-word, so any of them may be
used to locate a package. This will be inefficient in terms of DB
performance, but at least not worse then the legacy solution.

This change makes it so wildcards can be used in bandit.yaml when
configuring function calls that should be alerted on.  For example, it
allows 'telnetlib.*' to be set as a blacklist entry, and will then
alert on a call to telnetlib.Telnet() and any other functions in that
namespace.

It uses stdlib's fnmatch, which means the wildcards are Unix shell
style.

This change also hijacks the telnetlib import check, adding a wildcarded
blacklist calls check as described above and adjusting tests and
example naming accordingly.

The ceilometer audit events stored at the ceilometer database
currently don't have user_id/project_id associated with them
even though this information is available as part of the event
message payload. The user_id and project_id information has to
be stored as traits so that there's user/project context for each
event and these traits are required to apply RBAC-based rules
and filters on events. For eg., presence of these traits enable
db queries - like get all events for a project/user against events.
The audit event definition in the events yaml file already stores
payload.initiator.id as initiator_id but the initiator_id trait
is not a common trait across all events and thus this trait cannot
be used to apply RBAC filter against events.This changeset will
thus add user_id and project_id traits to the audit events namely
*.http.* and add useri_id and project_id as default traits for all
events.

We're seeing some neutron db sync failures in master branch (liberty).
It looks like there may be a few issues with the way we're handling
migrations:

1. We're not capturing the correct information in the 'Check last DB
   revision' task as the first line returned by 'neutron-db-manage
   history' is a header (this also means that the 'Inspect on disk
   neutron DB revision' task will never do what we intend).
2. We delegate 'Check last DB revision' to 'neutron_all' group, but in
   an ideal world this is probably only necessary on 'neutron_server'.
3. When stopping neutron server to run 'Perform a Neutron DB Upgrade',
   we're only stopping it on groups['neutron_server'][0], while all
   other neutron server containers are up servicing requests.
4. Perform a db stamp, which doesn't appear to be necessary.

This change makes the following changes:

1. Bumps neutron SHA to include 43c00a9, which introduces new
   --expand / --contract upgrade options (otherwise, you have to
   specify liberty_expand@head / liberty_contract@head which may no
   longer work when neutron gets bumped in the future)
2. Checks if migrations have previously run, and if not runs a
   'neutron-db-manage upgrade heads'
3. If migrations have previously run:
   a) it runs an online migration against expand alembic branch using
      'neutron-db-manage upgrade --expand'.
   b) it stops all neutron-server services
   c) it runs an offline migration against contract alembic branch
      using 'neutron-db-manage upgrade --contract'
   d) it starts all neutron-server instances
4. It removes the temporary pin introduced in
   https://review.openstack.org/218572 as the SHA bump includes the
   upstream fix https://review.openstack.org/218723

TODO: Currently, we upgrade expand and contract branches (shutting down
      neutron-server in the proceses), even if there are no pending
      migrations.  We need to find a clean way to check what migration
      we are on and compare to alembic HEADS file to see if we're up to
      date.  Unfortunately, 'neutron-db-manage current' doesn't indicate
      which migration is in which alembic branch, so you would have to
      further grep for each migration in the neutron migrations code to
      determine the branch.

NOTE: Liberty introduces the split alembic branches for online/offline
      migrations, see [1] for more information.

When importing backup metadata only required fields were being imported,

This led to some serious problems when importing backups back, since

With this change MuranoPackage becomes first-class DSL citizen.
Packages have version, runtime_version (that is specified
in Format attribute of the manifest file) and a list of classes.
Previously engine used to have package loader which had most
of ""load"" functionality and class loader that mostly acted as an
adapter from package loader to interface that DSL used to
get classes. Now class loader is gone and is replaced with
package loader at the DSL level. Package loader is responsible
for loading packages by either package or class name (as it was
before) plus semantic_version spec (for example "">=1.2,<2.0"").
Package loader can now keep track of several versions of the same
package.

Also packages now have requirements with version specs.
All class names that are encountered in application code are
looked up within requirements only. As a consequence
packages that use other packages without referencing
them explicitly will become broken. An exception from this rule
is core library which is referenced automatically.

The functional tests included some tests for creating AES keys with
different bit lengths. Most of those bit lengths were not valid. The
tests can cause some secret stores to return failures because the key
lengths were not valid. The tests were also setting the bit length to
different values but not modifying the payload. The payload is now
being created for the appropriate bit length.

One of the tests was passing the algorithm and bit length as part of a
storage operation. The algorithm name was invalid. This can cause some
failures on devices that do not support that algorithm.

The tests that use non-standard algorithms or bit lengths were
decorated with a non-standard-algorithm attribute. This will allow
testers to skip those tests when selecting which ones to run.

Unfortunately, such a small timeout for hearbeats cause an incredible
regression for Astute <-> RabbitMQ connectivity.

Basically, if Astute's sending a huge message to RabbitMQ and by some
reason we aren't able to do it within 2 seconds (heartbeat timeout),
the connection will be dropped by RabbitMQ server.

In fact, that's happened on SWARM while

* Astute takes almost 100% CPU usage (bug #1491794)
* Astute's sending diagnostic snapshot result message to Nailgun
  (more than 4MB of data).

Since heartbeats aren't solve the problem we have tried to fix, let's
revert the original commit e24ca066bf6160bc1e419aaa5d486cad1aaa937d.

This change allows to set the reboot timeout in libvirt domain if the
image metadata (property-name ""hw_reboot_timeout"") or flavor extra spec
(name ""hw:reboot_timeout"") is configured to set it.
This reboot timeout controls whether and after how long the guest
should start booting again in case the boot fails.
The value is in milliseconds with maximum of 65535 and special value -1
(default) disables the reboot.
It is especially advantageous in combination with a boot menu enabled,
since in that case the user can select for error a non bootable volume.

set_gateway, to dynamically set the external gateway of a router to
the network that is created as part of the scenario.

This also adds a new function to the Neutron utils, _create_routers,
that creates a network and a given number of subnets and routers.

Existing rsync stop/start handlers were relying on the pattern
parameter to the Ansible service module which relies on the results
of ps to determine if the service is running. This is unnecessary
because the rsync service script is well-behaved and responds
appropriately to start stop and restart commands. Removal of the
pattern param ensures that the response from the service command is
used instead.

Root cause of the bug is that when Keystone was changed to share
fernet secrets via rsync over ssh tunnel, an rsync process was
introduced in AIOs, Swift stand-alones, and other deployment
configurations that contain Keystone containers on the storage hosts.

The resulting rsync processes within Keystone containers pollute the
results of ps commands on the host, fooling Ansible into thinking
that an rsync service is running on the standard port when it is not.

Secondly, the handler responsible for stopping rsync was not causing
the notice for ""Ensure rsync service running"" to trigger cleanly in
my testing, so the tasks were changed to trigger both notices in an
ordered list.

We make sure that rebuild now uses claims and resource tracking. This
means that we will now be properly tracking resources for
rebuilt/evacuated instances and will potentially fail if a move of the
instance breaks policy set by the scheduler (an exception would be in
case we bypassed the scheduler).

We also make sure that we update the migration record with the current
status (either success or failure).

On a failure to claim, we will currently just error out the instance
which requires manual intervention, but taking advantage of the retry
mechanism could be added in the future.

Since none of the required args are sent yet, this change is effectively
a no-op, until we change the rebuild_instance RPC method to send the
required data over.

to the Pyngus API will preserve compatibility with older versions of
Proton, since the next release of Proton wil be changing its SASL API.

Pyngus 2.0 also adds strict enforcement of callback re-entrancy
constrants.  This patch fixes some bad driver reentrancy violations.

This patch removes all SHA specifications for the OpenStack clients
so that any client requirement versions are determined solely from
the requirements of the OpenStack service and Global requirements
files.

This resolves issues where the client versions we carry are
incompatible with the services, resulting in unexpected failures.

Tempest requirements are specifically ignored as the tempest role
downloads its required clients directly from pip.

Finally, due to the change in the openstack-client version used the
heat domain/role/user tasks fail as they require the CLI to specify
the user and project domain name/id. This patch includes the CLI
changes to ensure that the deployment completes properly.

start/bind to an ip the host doesn't have (avoiding ip conflicts)

This allows haproxy to bind on non_local addresses by
addng a sysctl change in the playbook: net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1
The sysctl is changed for the containers/systems
when external_lb_vip is different than internal address and
the number of haproxy hosts is more than one thanks to a group_var.

Side-effect: other services are able to bind on non-local addresses
if the sysctl is changed.

This could be overriden by setting the variable haproxy_bind_on_non_local
in your user_* variables. If set to false, then the ip_non_local_bind
sysctl won't be changed.

After this patch was merged: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/190601/
Rally gates become broken.

The check in jenkis/jobs/rally.yaml that should switch to new

At this moment we are installing 2 versions of Rally
(with new and old way) one is master another one is master + patch.

As a result Rally gates are testing Rally master instead of
proposed patch to Rally.

This patch removes check of new/old style and use always new plugin style

After the service split, some of the configuration, parsing and

get closer to the services where it belongs.

This patch starts from ProviderConfiguration and ServiceTypeManager

of known advanced services, so that in the long run we can make
Neutron easier to plug with external services.
