Add the driver interface and the Ryu's BGP speaker implementation.
All communication starts in the agent and the Neutron API just responds
to these calls.

In the Neutron API two new methods are added to handle agent's calls: one
for send the advertise routes and the other one to receive the
discovered routes. These discovered routes are passed to
routinginstance's associated routers and saved into extraroutes database
table.

Dynamic routing needs a new agent that will host the BGP speaker driver
and will do the actual communication between BGP peers.

This agent will take information from a single Routing Instance entity,
that has all the information that the agent needs to do the routing
exchange: peers and routes. In this approach, an agent can only host one
Routing Instance to avoid conflicts.

This commit intruduces a dummy agent that auto-registers to Neutron API
and send keep-alive messages.

A binding between the agent and the routing instance is mandatory in the
database and also the api endpoints to let the user
associate/disassociate a routing instante to an agent.

There is also an autoscheduling feature that will assign a routing
instance to the first agent that asks for synchronization. Default
scheduler class will only assign non-assigned routing instances to
agents. HA feature (two agents hosting the same routing instance) has to
be done manually.

Just a toe in the water, but the Linux Bridge agent should be importing
from the common agent library, since that library imports the linux utils
in turn. This reflects the same behavior of the OVS agent.

This is a base patch for further work, to explore if the Linux Bridge
agent can use more of the code in the neutron.agent.common namespace,

Replace the whitelist of flake8 checks (select) with a blacklist
(ignore).  It makes possible to disable a single check, which was not
possible before. This new approach permits to enable new tests more
easily and see which checks are currently disabled.

Only new checks are disabled, this change doesn't run less checks than
before. Currently, many checks are disabled, but following changes will
fix these new warnings.

When the ""select"" option of flake8 is used in tox.ini, the ""ignore""
option is ignored. It is not possible to use ""select"" and ""ignore""
options at the same time. See the code in pep8 (flake8 is based on
pep8):

https://github.com/PyCQA/pep8/blob/d48eef071003952ed0f98445dc3dc6bc29618f9c/pep8.py#L1808

The purpose of flake8 is to enhance the coding style, but also to help
to detect common bugs. Blacklisting checks permits to detect new bugs
when upgrading the tools. For example, new checks were recently added to
help porting code to Python 3.

This change permits to use pbr 1.0 and newer which is required to
support Python 3. Previously, hacking 0.8.1 was used, but hacking 0.8 is
incompatible with pbr 1.0 and newer (hacking 0.8 requires pbr<1.0).

pbr 1.0 is required to use environment markers on requirements to
install dnspython on Python 2 and dnspython3 on Python 3.

The glance image plugin uses two separate functions for create and update based
on the notification type. Under these functions it is called update on the
elasticsearch client.  This call will fail with a 404 error if the image
doesn't already exist.  The reason for it not existing may be numerous
(Create notifications dropped due to some sort of error, user deletes from
index, etc), but we can not worry about why it may not exist.  Instead this
should do create_or_update like functionality and if the image doesn't exist
on the update call, it should be inserted.

This patch makes use of the elastic search functionality called doc_as_upsert,
which natively provides the type of handling desired as stated above.

The flavor extra specs for quotas has been extended to support
 quota:memory_limit - The utilization of a virtual machine will
                      not exceed this limit, even if there are available
                      resources. This is typically used to ensure a
                      consistent performance of virtual machines
                      independent of available resources.
                      Units are MB.
 quota:memory_reservation -  guaranteed minimum reservation (MB)
 quota:memory_shares_level - the allocation level. This can be 'custom', 'high'
                             'normal' or 'low'.
 quota:memory_shares_share - in the event that 'custom' is used, this is the
                             number of shares.

2. hash(sample1) % 2 (num agents) == agent1 sends sample to agent2

In this change, there are proposed improvement to Swift documentation aimed at
first-time contributors. They include a simplification of the Getting
Started page and a new page with some basic instructions/commands that the
first-time contributor should know. In addition, it shows some common errors
that the first-time contributor may find when executing git rebase and
information on how to track your changes.

As per bug discussion, conntrackd is actually not needed for netfilter
framework, and given that users do not appear to find the logs useful
(the only reason we're using conntrackd), let's just remove it.

This commit also defines a variable container_remove_packages so that
the list of packages to remove from containers can be added to in the
future.

NOTE: removing conntrackd does not unload the kernel conntrack modules
or disable the netfilter conntrack framework. It simply means we are not
gathering ostensibly useless logging. The kernel conntrack flows can
still be interrogated with the 'conntrack' userspace cli tool, for real
time debugging.

alarm.rule['query'] is referenced and extended. When the alarm being
refreshed, the *alarm* object will be updated to db in _refresh()

When running beaker with Jenkins, it's useful to get the logs at the end
of the job, so we can easily debug eventual failures.

This patch aims to create a Rake task to copy the logs. For that, we
need to make sure WORKSPACE is set (automatically done when running the
job on a Jenkins node). This task will copy the Keystone logs in the workspace.

To run the task, you need to run `rake copy_logs` which is what
OpenStack Infra is doing.

This mimics the widely accepted convention from PEP8 and many other
places that lines longer than 79 columns can not only cause problems
when reading/writing code, but also often indicate a bad smell,
e.g. too many levels of indentation due to overly complex functions
which require refactoring into smaller chunks.

Keystone Auth was previously non-functional as the Keystone
API resource being used does not support Roles as required
by the function to map to Anchor Groups.

This was further compounded by the required HTTP return code
being 200 (OK), but the function with POST returns a 201
(CREATED).

This change, switches to to using a GET Keystone API
resource to validate the token passed in by the user.

The keystone unit tests have been updated to a real sample
JSON response from the resource called (rather than the
bogus one previously used) and split up the 3 current tests
into separate functions.

However, long term I really think we will want to switch to
using keystonemiddleware library - rather than our homebrew
usage.

Dynamic routing needs a new agent that will host the BGP speaker driver
and will do the actual communication between BGP peers.
This agent will take information from a single BGP speaker entity,
that has all the information that the agent needs to do the routing
exchange: peers and routes. In this approach, an agent can only host one
BGP speaker to avoid conflicts.
This commit intruduces a dummy agent that auto-registers to Neutron API
and send keep-alive messages.

A binding between the agent and the BGP speaker is mandatory in the
database and also the api endpoints to let the user
associate/disassociate a BGP speaker to an agent.
There is also an autoscheduling feature that will assign a BGP speaker
to the first agent that asks for synchronization. Default
scheduler class will only assign non-assigned BGP speakers to
agents.

HA feature (two agents hosting the same routing instance) has to be done manually.

Outstanding Items:
- Unit and API testcases
- RpcCallback implementation

The policy tests are meant to check if certain roles are properly
enforced by our policy engine. To do this we use the standard
controllers and force an exception in the actual code, just after we
have actually passed the policy.

The code was actually doing what it intended to do, in an unintended
way. By passing the ""external_project_id"" to the
on_[get|post|delete|put] it was finally getting a TypeError when it
would try to execute the actual code. This was unexpected and
confusing.

The intent of this CR is to get rid of the aforementioned behaviour and
instead force an IOError whenever possible (either by accessing certain
functions, or when trying to access the body of the request).

IP rule priorities assigned to DVR floating IPs need
to be preserved over L3 agent restarts. Such a
 mechanism is already in place for Link Local IP
address allocation.

This change generalizes the allocation management
mechanism used for managing Link Local IP addresses
and utilizes it for managing floating ip rule priorities.

An ItemAllocator class is defined and used to instantiate
allocators for floating ip rule priorities and Link Local
IP addresses.

TRACE is a logging keyword that is understood by most logging
tools. OpenStack has repurposed this in the past to not be TRACE
logging but instead be used whenever a Stacktrace was dumped. This
was already fixed in:
I8c618e7b8523bcc0e19a9b77c4d2d5984369a04a

Now in this review, we are adding a new TRACE level set to an
integer halfway between DEBUG and NOTSET which is currently 5.

One can also use LOG.trace for deep tracing of their code as well.
To make it easy for end users to import the TRACE level, added
public constants for all the log levels from logging module. Several
projects import logging just for the constants, this will help
them as well.

Please see the logging guidelines for more info:
https://github.com/openstack/openstack-specs/blob/master/specs/log-guidelines.rst

As per bug discussion, conntrackd is actually not needed for netfilter
framework, and given that users do not appear to find the logs useful
(the only reason we're using conntrackd), let's just remove it.

This commit also defines a variable container_remove_packages so that
the list of packages to remove from containers can be added to in the
future.

NOTE: removing conntrackd does not unload the kernel conntrack modules
or disable the netfilter conntrack framework. It simply means we are not
gathering ostensibly useless logging. The kernel conntrack flows can
still be interrogated with the 'conntrack' userspace cli tool, for real
time debugging.

When pooling an Ironic node to check it's states we were getting the whole
node object representation. That is heavy weight because it includes
everything from that node, including sometimes the whole configdrive
(a base64 string of it). We don't need to do it, the Ironic API exposes
an endpoint (v1/nodes/<uuid>/states) that will return only the current
states of a specific node. This patch is updating the code to use that
endpoint and stop wasting bandwidth with information we don't care about
when checking for the node states.

* New variables to configure Keystone as an identity provider are now
  supported under a root `keystone_idp` variable. Example configurations
  can be seen in Keystone's defaults file. This configuration includes
  the location of the signing certificate, authentication endpoints and

* xmlsec1 is installed in the Keystone containers when IdP configuration
  is enabled.

The upgrade procedure should create a new cluster with the same
parameters as the original cluster. The new method was intoduced to
parameters the cluster that was created with. The return value of the
new method is compatible with the data that are expected by the create
method.

A set of hooks of the extension mechanism was extended by the
fire_callback_on_cluster_delete hook. This hooks is fired when cluster
is deleted.

Two opposite method were added: get_assigned_vips and
assign_given_vips_for_net_groups. The first method returns all assigned
VIPs of the cluster and the second complementary method receives the
same format that the first returns to assign given VIPs.

The patch has some impact on the get_admin_network_group method. This
impact consist of adding a new filter called node_group_id that allows
to filter network groups by ID of the node group when there are no any
nodes in the cluster.

If Manila API runs on a system with IPv6, it listens on IPv4 by default,
but clients try IPv6 first. The resulting retry is unnecessary. On Linux,
it is easy to listen on both address families simply by opening an IPv6

The docstring was listing disk_info as a tuple but it's a dict in the
code and it wasn't pointing out that boot_index is an optional field.

Long-term we should probably convert disk_info into an object (doesn't
need to be versioned, but would be cleaner as an object). I started
doing this with a namedtuple but the format and boot_index fields being
optional makes namedtuple a bit messy.

completely to the vertical edge, and make it kind of gorpy to read.

This patch adds tests for 'update' for both policies and rules. This
completes the CRUD tests and leaves the association/disassociation for
a later patch. Note that deleting a rule isn't tested explicitly
because of a bug with the rule delete logic on the server side. Once
that code is fixed, the test should be added.

to_dict() for policies should also convert any rules inside rule lists
to dicts too, otherwise API layer receives rule object __repr__ strings
instead of actual dicts. This patch introduces a fix to the existing
to_dict() code to properly support policies.

This patch also modifies the base infra to create policies and rules for
admins and not for tenant.

This service aims to simplify that by centralizing open, close, and dismiss.
It also provides some default options that you must override via init.

Description:
When openvswitch restarts, neutron_ovs_agent will reset the br-tun bridge,
which removes all tunnel ports/flows.

Each neutron_ovs_agent could maintain all l2 population fdb entries locally and
make every fdb add/remove/update operations thread-safe to improve the

If l2 population is enabled, it maintains all l2 population fdb entries locally
and recreates ports/flows.

The only place we test the interaction between agents and the controller
is in Tempest. These are however 'heavy' tests and are very high level.
There are features that aren't tested in Tempest (Due to no multi node testing
or for other reasons) that have coverage for each individual component but
not for how they interact. In-tree full-stack testing will mitigate this,
but like Tempest, it is too high level as basic RPC interaction can be tested
at a lower level.

The idea is to use the fake Oslo messaging driver (Which is already being
used every where) but to take care not to  mock out critical bits. The fake
driver simply passes messages around in-process without the use of an external
messaging service. The server RPC handlers are already being tested,
so there's no need to test them again. The Oslo messaging driver is not under
test either. So what is being tested? These sort of RPC tests just call an RPC
method from a client, without mocking anything. If the RPC method is expected
to return something, that should be asserted as well.

These tests can catch regressions such as:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1414812

Future work in dependent patches:
* Complete coverage for all RPC methods.
* Mock heavy unit tests that assert that True == True may now be replaced.
* Rolling upgrades cannot be tested via this framework, but via something
  similar to grenade, which Nova always runs with Nova network. I hope
  to look into running it with Neutron as well.

These tests may be run (On your laptop) with:
tox -e functional neutron.tests.functional.api.rpc

This patch includes RPC tests for the agent report_state and
L3 agent methods just so we can be sure the RPC testing framework
provides sufficient functionality for different RPC endpoints.

That patch allows a developer to remotely run a pydev debugger and having the
Neutron process connect back to it.

The implementation is similar to the one found in the Keystone or glance
project.

Four configuration options have been added:

    pydev-debug-host <host>. Default is None
    pydev-debug-port <port>. Default is None
    standard-threads (bool): Do not monkey-patch threading system modules.
    no-standard-threads (bool): inverse of --standard-threads. This is the
                             default behavior.

The behavior is enabled if `pydev-debug-host` *and* `pydev-debug-port` are
both not None.

Example:

1. neutron connecting back to pydevd using standard threads

   --pydev-debug-host 1.2.3.4 --pydev-debug-port 12345

2. neutron connection back to pydevd using patched threads

   --pydev-debug-host 1.2.3.4 --pydev-debug-port 12345 --no-standard-threads

If the behavior is enabled, an os.environ variable will be set to indicate
that the thread must not get monkey patched:
(http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2012-August/000794.html).
Then, the pydev connection will be performed by the server right when starting
after reading the configuration.

Minor modifications were required to deal with the multiple calls to the
eventlet monkey patcher in multiple places throughout the Neutron code: a new
module in common has been defined performing the actual patch and
checking if whether or not standard threads are in use to discard thread patch
calls. Calls to eventlet monkey patcher have been changed to leverage this new
module throughout the Neutron code.

`standard-threads` option can be enabled independently of the pydev debug
options using the configuration options or by simply setting up an
environment variable called `STANDARD_THREADS`.

If the pydev connection fails to be established with the remote debugger an
exception is raised.

This patch will allow remote debugging as well as more seamless debugging
environments with IDEs not compatible with patched threads.

Our current gate runs both WSGI & Eventlet tests on the same node, and
the order seems random.

That means WSGI can runs first and eventlet second. In that order,
during the second phase, apache won't be stopped so keystone-server
won't start so the binding will be the same as apache/wsgi.

This patch use the same way as WSGI tests to try 5000 and 35357 binding
for Keystone API service.

This use case isn't covered by our current APIs:

Because we have a dedicated API for that:

  GET /entities/{entity_id}

But our list() methods generally support **kwargs, which are passed as
query parameters to keystone. When an 'id' is passed to keystone as a
query parameter, keystone rightly ignores it and returns an unfiltered
collection.

To provide the expected user experience, this change swaps calls like
list(id=...) with [get(id)] instead, which calls the correct HTTP API.

git remote prune is sometimes hitting the same ""GnuTLS recv error (-9):
