Live migration is currently totally broken if a NUMA topology is
present. This affects everything that's been regrettably stuffed in with
NUMA topology including CPU pinning, hugepage support and emulator
thread support. Side effects can range from simple unexpected
performance hits (due to instances running on the same cores) to
complete failures (due to instance cores or huge pages being mapped to
CPUs/NUMA nodes that don't exist on the destination host).

Until such a time as we resolve these issues, we should alert users to
the fact that such issues exist. A workaround option is provided for
operators that _really_ need the broken behavior, but it's defaulted to
False to highlight the brokenness of this feature to unsuspecting
operators.

Current DHCP port management in Neutron makes the server to clear the
device_id while the agent is responsible for setting it.

This may cause a potential race condition, for example during network
rescheduling. The server aims to clear the device_id on a DHCP port and
assign the network to another agent while the old agent might just be
taking possession of the port. If the DHCP agent takes possession of the
port (i.e., update port...set the device_id) before the server clears
it, then there is no issue. However, if this happens after the clear
operation by server then the DHCP port would be updated/marked to be
owned by the old agent.

When the new agent takes over the network scheduled to it, it won't be
able to find a port to reuse so that an extra port might need to be
created. This leads to two issues:
1) an extra port is created and never deleted;
2) the extra port creation may fail if there are no available IP
addresses.

This patch proposes a validation check to prevent an agent from updating
a DHCP port unless the network is bound to that agent.

New releases of oslo.config support a 'mutable' parameter in Opts.
oslo.service provides an option [1] which allows services to tell it
they want mutate_config_files to be called by passing a parameter.

This commit is to use the same approach. This allows Blazar to benefit
from [2], where the 'debug' option (owned by oslo.log) is made mutable.
We should be able to turn debug logging on and off by changing the
config and sending a SIGHUP signal to blazar-manager.

However, please note that blazar-manager currently doesn't work
correctly after receiving a SIGHUP. As a result the mutable config is
not yet usable. Operators should continue restarting blazar-manager
after changing blazar.conf.

Increasing the CA certificate expiration to 3650 days resolves the issue and

This patchs aims at reducing the amout of code required by a collector for
metric validation (meaning no code at all in case the collector doesn't
require any additional metric collection parameters).

The following work has been done:

* Fixed the ""check_configuration"" method of the base collector and made it
  return data in the same format as its child classes.

* Made each collector call the ""check_configuration"" method of the
  base collector.

* Added some metric conf validation test cases

* Added details to docstrings in the base collector

  - changess the _create_resources() to create the

  - changes the on_start(), update_resources(), and _reallocate() to
    add the ``CUSTOM_RESERVATION_{reservation UUID}`` inventory to the

    This should be fixed in a following patch where arbitrary affinity

The container-registry role is idempotent in a way that the
restarting of the docker service will be done only if some
configuration value has changed.
During the upgrade, host_prep_tasks are being run and if the
new templates bring some configuration change then the Docker
service gets restarted. The issue is the point at which they
get restarted, which is after the upgrade_tasks have already
run and prior to the deploy_tasks. This is causing issues with
Pacemaker handled resources.

For that reason, we include the very same task running in host_prep_tasks
into upgrade_tasks for the docker and docker-registry services,
forcing the Docker service reconfiguration to happen during
upgrade_tasks instead of at a latter point.

Regsitered limit set CLI takes --service, --region and
--resource-name as param which can be updated along with
--default limit for existing registered limit.

Default limit can be updated with same value and CLI
return the success. But --service, --region and --resource-
name cannot be same as existing one. CLI return 409
for this case. Which is valid behaviour because more than
one limit with same service and same resource cannot exist.

But help message of --service, --region and --resource-name
are not much clear to tell that they cannot be passed with
same value.

This patch clarifies the help message for resigtered limit set CLI.

Horizon and most horizon plugins support Django 2.0 in Rocky.
This commit focuses on passing the unit tests with Django 2.0.
It would be nice if masakari-dashboard team tests it in
real environments.

Replace django.core.urlresolves with django.urls

(In Django 2.0) The django.core.urlresolvers module is removed
in favor of its new location, django.urls.
It was deprecated in Django 1.10:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.10/#id3

Drops older Django unit tests from tox.ini
as horizon dropped Django <=1.10 support in Rocky.

At present when inspecting a file based image we always use ``qemu-img`` to
determine the virtual size of the image. This works well but can lead to
the resource tracker taking considerable time to update on hosts with
a large number of instances/images.

This change switches to using os.stat and os.path.getsize to determine
the allocated and virtual disk sizes of RAW disks.

Future changes will look into caching the virtual size of the disk
within disk.info locally on the host to also improve this for qcow2 and
ploop, further simplifying this code path.

The existing nova-api to placement database migration shell scripts
don't include the post task to stamp the placement database to the
(b4ed3a175331) version. Without that stamping, syncing the DB to the
current version fails on having the initial upgrade: (initial) ->
(b4ed3a175331). This is because it assumes the initial DB has no
contents and tries to create the tables again.

This patch changes the shell scripts to include that stamping task
rather than leaving it as operators' manual duties to safely bring
the placement DB under alembic version control.

With this change, the shell scripts will need to be executed under the
following condition:
 - The placement is already installed to execute `placement-manage *`
 - The placement cli can access the placement's database, for example,
   by reffering to the `[placement_database]` section in the
   `placement.conf`.

In the from-rocky placement extraction script, this patch reverses
the order to migrate the database and to create the placement.conf.

This is because ``[placement_database]/connection`` should be set
before the database migration shell script is executed if we want
to stamp the database version within the shell script.

This reverts commit ea8ae41f6146d762bfe4b146a71dbda6740dcf08.

When using this patch, tempest seems to always have a return code
of 0, so it looks like the tests passed even when they did not.

Also, the 'always' section of the block was mistakenly removed.

In patch [1] I marked all MySQL related migration tests
as unstable but I made mistake with calling super() method in
tests from TestModelsMigrationsMysql class.
This wasn't catched as tests were skipped instead of fail.

This patch fixes that, so tests can be run properly and be skipped
only if ""real"" issue with timeout will happen.

As we move forward with the python build/install simplification,
more of the config is being applied in the pip conf, rather than
being given as CLI options in each ansible task. This is good
for providing a consistent experience, but has side effects for
things like the Ansible bootstrap.

When bootstrapping Ansible, we want to make use of a specific
set of constraints which is not polluted by additional config
on the host. We do not want the constraints from the repo
server because they happen to include a constraint for Ansible
which clashes with our requirement. As such, we only want the
native OpenStack upper-constraints.

In this patch we use the --isolated CLI option to ignore the
host's pip configuration. We also introduce the ability to set
extra pip install options by using the PIP_OPTS environment
variable. This can be used to set the installation to use an
alternative pypi mirror, or for extra links, etc.

We currently use a gate hook that adds
a hardcoded image name which is cirros-0.3.5-x86_64-disk to work
around a devstack bug[2].

A recent patch[1] changed the deployed image to
cirros-0.3.6-x86_64-disk.

Now that the bug[2] has been resolved we no longer need to pin the
cirros image config in our gates.

finally,mount the before root volume.So we can privide the image

Under postgresql, the GROUP BY clause in this query fails with:

  DBError: (psycopg2.ProgrammingError) column ""instance_mappings.created_at""
  must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function

And we're getting lucky with using this under mysql because we don't
have the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode set (but we probably should).

This change removes the GROUP BY clause and re-writes the query
to avoid the joinedload() from the instance_mappings table and
simply do a subquery to get the cell_ids and then do a simple
IN query with the cell_mappings table. This fixes the GROUP BY
issue and should also make the query more efficient since we
won't have to load InstanceMappings ORM objects.

Without these, if you try to run tox -epy37,functional-py37 you'll
get a successful tox run, but no actual tests are run, which is
rather misleading. Given the generaly availability of python 3.7
this is a bad thing.

Running the tests under python 3.7 identified a few minor tests
failures, also fixed here. Each is a result of a change in behavior in
python 3.7:

* printable unicode changes with a new Unicode 11-based unicodedata
  package
* intentionally raising StopIteration in a generator is now considered a
  RuntimeError, 'return' should be used instead
* an exception message is different beween python 3 and python 2, and the
  guard for it was mapping python 3.5 and 3.6 but not 3.7.

zuul configuration is adjusted to add an experimental job for python 3.7
unit. A functional test job is not added, because we don't have 3.6 yet,
and we probably want to get through that first.

The previous wording introduced unneccesary confusion about when the
goal would be set. Clarify that the goal is set at the beginning of a
release cycle as usual, and should be completed by the end of the
release cycle.

Also, avoid using the word 'support' to refer to which versions of
Python we run unit tests on.

So when we landed https://review.openstack.org/#/c/569565/ we created
the remote authkey file with the following constraints:
  Exec[""Create Cluster ${cluster_name}""] -> File['etc-pacemaker-authkey']
  File['etc-pacemaker-authkey'] -> Exec[""Start Cluster ${cluster_name}""]

This was because pcs, at the time, would remove the authkey when calling
cluster setup. pcs has now been fixed to not remove this key anylonger
and so we actually want it create as one of the very first things. I.e.
even before pcsd starts.

That way we have the guarantee that pcs is aware of it and will not
remove it when destroying the cluster [1].

This will remove the error messages that were seen on the remotes for a
certain amount of time (until pacemaker decided to reread the authkey
from disk and retry the connection with the new credentials):
pacemaker_remoted[21460]:  notice: LRMD client connection established. 0x55d7f48bdad0 id: e662d8b9-c353-4e0e-9818-158812fedd34
pacemaker_remoted[21460]:   error: TLS handshake with Pacemaker Remote failed: Decryption has failed.

While we're at it we need to make every pcs auth command explicitely
require Service['pcsd']. Right now this works by pure accident, those
commands do fail if puppet decides to order them before pcsd is up and
running.

The `undercloud.conf` file has now 2 sections (DEFAULT and ctlplane-subnet).
A small numbers of parameters have been deprecated and moved to
the ctlplane-subnet section.

This patch proposes to use 'crudini' to get parameter's values from the

When updating the volume type, the length of the name is checked to be
0-255. If the user input length is 255 characters
(e.g. volume_type_name='X*255'), when synchronizing the quota resource,
the resource name needs to be updated to the form of 'resource +
volume_type_name' in quota_usages [1], because the resource attribute in
the DB is set to 'String(255)', the length limit is exceeded.

Therefore, the resource column attribute in the quota_usages database table
needs to be changed from 'String(255)' to 'String(300)'.

with Ansible 2.5.11.

There are a few manual workarounds that we're placing in order
to workaround old versions of machinectl however we don't actually
leverage those and they seem to be causing a dbus restart which
causes extra problems.

This patch removes those workarounds in order to prevent restarting
dbus which causes the system to start timing out on systemd-logind.

This patch implements a custom select in the load balancer creation/edit
form with the following features:

- The options are presented in a tabular form with: network name,
  network id, subnet name, subnet id
- An input text filter which filters across all fields

The select is implemented as a customizable AngularJS component, which
allows for any of the displayed information to be changed easily.

This should have been fixed via:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/460175/2

where we did:
service_config_settings:
  haproxy:
    tripleo.horizon.firewall_rules:
     '127 horizon':
        dport:
          - 80
          - 443

The problem is that the above does not work. Reason for this is the way
tripleo::firewall works.  It will only apply iptables rules for that
show up in hiera('service_names'):
    $service_names = hiera('service_names', [])
    tripleo::firewall::service_rules { $service_names: }

And since horizon is not in the service running on the haproxy role, the
above rule would never have been created.

Tested this change and now I correctly get the iptables rules on the
haproxy role for horizon:
[root@overcloud-core-0 ~]# iptables -nvL |grep horizon
    0     0 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0            multiport dports 80,443 state NEW /* 127 horizon ipv4 */

When a deployment has instance ports that are neutron trunk ports with
DPDK vhu in vhostuserclient mode, when the instance reboots nova will
delete the ovs port and then recreate when the host comes back from
reboot.  This quick transition change can trigger a race condition that
causes the tbr trunk bridge to be deleted after the port has been
recreated.  See the bug for more details.

This change mitigates the race condition by adding a check for active
service ports within the trunk port deletion function.

If the ironic_config field is not present in a node definition, then
that node should not be registered with ironic. In this case we also
don't need to query glance for images or wait for resources to appear
in placement.

If nova_flavors is empty, we do not need to register flavors, so no need
to install the client or check for OS_USERNAME.

Also fixes an issue in the action plugin where it would fail if
ironic_config field is not present in a node definition.

Finally, in CI deploy/teardown tests, rather than skipping tasks, we now
remove the ironic_config field from the node definition, and set
nova_flavors to empty, such that we exercise these code paths.

Based on eventlet issue [1] ThreadPoolExecutor doesn't play nice with
eventlet in python 3.7. We saw deadlocks in the functional-py37
execution in live migration tests due to live migration using
ThreadPoolExecutor.

The [1] suggests to replaces ThreadPoolExecutor with
futurist.GreenThreadPoolExecutor to avoid deadlocks. So this patch does
the replacement and adjusts the unit tests accordingly.

As the ThreadPoolExecutor was the last used class from the futures
module we remove that from the requirements and add the futurist module
instead.

because it can't write the pid in the corresponding neutron folder and
break the IPv6 functionality.

This patch allows radvd process to run with the same user used by
neutron. In order to allow this, it changes the radvd config file
permissions to 444 because radvd doesn't allow that this file can be
writeable by self/group. The readonly mode is not a problem updating the
file because of the way the neutron_lib replace_file function handles
the files operations.

Currently the new Attachment calls in Cinder aren't checking the status
of the volume when create or update is called.  This isn't good because
it can mask problems with attach processes on the volume.

This patch adds an explicit check of the volume status in both
attachment_create and attachment_update, and if the volume status is in
any error state, the call will result in an InvalidVolume exception.

This is an API change to fix a bug, and is not microversioned.

* Fixes the .gitignore file to only ignore local.conf in the root

With the changed PTI doc building, this repo can now use the standard
way of building docs, use publish-openstack-docs-pti template and remove
custom jobs.

Since this repo is not co-installed, it does not need requirements and
lower-constraints - like none of the documentation projects. Remove
these.

Remove also lower-constraints tox environment and unused pip install
command from tox.ini as the default is just fine.

Remove passenv from docs environment, this is not needed with current CI
jobs anymore.

This enables direct-io on the loop devices that we create for LVM backing
stores. The goal here is to reduce the buffer cache overhead involved with
loop mounting a very large file on a filesystem, as well as potentially
providing a little more block-device-like behavior for things that expect
them. We are hoping this will address some of the very long LVM calls that
cinder does, which randomly take a very long time, causing timeouts.

The loop direct-io support was added in kernel 4.4.0, which was xenial,
but the losetup binary does not have the required flag. Thus, this patch
checks the ""losetup -h"" output for the flag before deciding to enable it.

The ovs agent will install some basic drop flows first for the
physical bridge mappings during the init procedure. If message
queue is not connected, or neutron-servers are all down, real
traffic flows will not be refreshed anymore. This will cause
the data plane down if tenant network and provider network are
sharing the physical NICs.

This patch adds a RPC check during init L2 agent. When restart
the ovs-agent, if the MQ is OK and we have available neutron-server,
go next step. Otherwise, a rpc timeout will be raised. L2 agent
will start fail, physical bridge mapping drop flows will not be
installed. The original flows will not be replaced, so the traffic
can still work properly.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

does not go up resulting in the cluster failing to go up.

This patch drops that so it uses the default values of the admission
controllers in order to get the cluster to go up cleanly.

where setting amp_boot_network_list and amp_secgroup_list are being
loaded only by the worker service. These two options are shared by the
worker and health manager services.

This backport patch also includes a fix that went in commit
b6e82e20b0345d4b3d01a2dd25c87ac33922a222 that addressed a syntax error.

This patch remove the auto trigger post-copy, and add a new libvirt
configuration 'live_migration_completion_action'.

This option determines what actions will be taken against a VM after
``live_migration_completion_timeout`` expires. This option is set to
'abort' action by default, that means the live migrate operation will
be aborted after completion timeout expires. If option is set to
'force_complete', that means will either pause the VM or trigger
post_copy depending on if post copy is enabled and available.

Note that the progress based post-copy triggering from the libvirt
driver will be removed in next patch [1].

This is a simple test to try and trigger the force_complete

uses tiny Cirros guests we have to throttle the live migration
bandwidth to 1MiB and try and hit the timeout (1 second) and then
trigger post-copy (which should be available since we run with
libvirt 4.0.0 in the gate).

The change to tempest_test_blacklist in the job zuul job
definition means that the blacklist is only applied when the
job runs on changes to devstack-plugin-ceph but not when
the job runs on changes in any other repo, like cinder or
nova, which means the job is 100% failure now outside of this

Under postgresql, the GROUP BY clause in this query fails with:

  DBError: (psycopg2.ProgrammingError) column ""instance_mappings.created_at""
  must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function

And we're getting lucky with using this under mysql because we don't
have the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode set (but we probably should).

This change removes the GROUP BY clause and re-writes the query
to avoid the joinedload() from the instance_mappings table and
simply do a subquery to get the cell_ids and then do a simple
IN query with the cell_mappings table. This fixes the GROUP BY
issue and should also make the query more efficient since we
won't have to load InstanceMappings ORM objects.

Functional tests are executed by trovestack script, which uses python
in default OS version which is 2.7.

This change wraps python in tox and executes trovestack int_tests in
virtual enviroment, starting them in python3.

Any future python version change could be managed by tox framework.

We have VMs with 8 cores and 8GB of memory, this patch makes better
use of them by adding more cores (which shouldn't have much of a
negative impact) as CPU is not fully used during test runs.

This should hopefully improve performance of the functional tests.

Instead of keeping hardcoded files in bin/ directory it is
more flexible to install such files using setup.cfg file.
It will for example install files with correct shebang for
python2 and python3.

This patch also removes tools/osken-manager.spec file
as it was used by PyInstaller in Ryu and it isn't used
in os-ken.

Currently we don't use relabeling of the folder when SELinux is enabled.
This leads to the fact that we can not update the configuration of
haproxy during the update, because of missing permissions.

This commit adds the relabeling for the folder, which allows the
container with haproxy to write into it.

Since the grenade-py3 job is now in the neutron check and gate queues,
the neutron team would like to eliminate the neutron-grenade job as it
look like it duplicates the functionality of grenade-py3. This also
means the grenade job is now py3-compliant.
