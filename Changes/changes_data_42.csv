When tox 'docs' target is called, first it installs the dependencies
(listed in 'deps') in 'installdeps' phase, then it installs nova (with
its requirements) in 'develop-inst' phase. In the latter case 'deps' is
not used so that the constraints defined in 'deps' are not used.
This could lead to failures on stable branches when new packages are
released that break the build. To avoid this, the simplest solution is
to pre-install requirements, i.e. add requirements.txt to 'docs' tox
target.

We saw in the field that the pci_devices table can end up in
inconsistent state after a compute node HW failure and re-deployment.
There could be dependent devices where the parent PF is in available
state while the children VFs are in unavailable state. (Before the HW
fault the PF was allocated hence the VFs was marked unavailable).

In this state this PF is still schedulable but during the
PCI claim the handling of dependent devices in the PCI tracker fill fail
with the error: ""Attempt to consume PCI device XXX from empty pool"".

The reason of the failure is that when the PF is claimed, all the
children VFs are marked unavailable. But if the VF is already
unavailable such step fails.

One way the deployer might try to recover from this state is to remove
the VFs from the hypervisor and restart the compute agent. The compute
startup already has a logic to delete PCI devices that are unused and
not reported by the hypervisor. However this logic only removed devices
in 'available' state and ignored devices in 'unavailable' state.

If a device is unused and the hypervisor is not reporting the device any
more then it is safe to delete that device from the PCI tracker. So this
patch extends the logic to allow deleting 'unavailable' devices. There
is a small window when dependent PCI device is in 'unclaimable' state.
From cleanup perspective this is an analogous state. So it is also
added to the cleanup logic.

During the testing If9ab424cc7375a1f0d41b03f01c4a823216b3eb8 we noticed
that the unit test cases of PciTracker._set_hvdev are changing and
leaking global state leading to unstable tests.

To reproduce on master, duplicate the
test_set_hvdev_remove_tree_maintained_with_allocations test case and run
PciDevTrackerTestCase serially. The duplicated test case will fail with

  File ""/nova/nova/objects/pci_device.py"", line 238, in _from_db_object
  setattr(pci_device, key, db_dev[key])
  KeyError: 'id'

This is caused by the fact that the test data is defined on module
level, both _create_tracker and _set_hvdevs modifies the devices
passed to them, and some test mixes passing db dicts to _set_hvdevs
that expects pci dicts from the hypervisor.

This patch fixes multiple related issues:
* always deepcopy what _create_tracker takes as that list is later
  returned to the PciTracker via a mock and the tracker might modify
  what it got

* ensure that _create_tracker takes db dicts (with id field) while
  _set_hvdevs takes pci dicts in the hypervisor format (without id
  field)

* always deepcopy what is passed to _set_hvdevs as the PciTracker modify
  what it gets.

* normalize when the deepcopy happens to give a safe patter for future
  test cases

is used for scheduling (e.g. during a migration of a pre Victoria
instance with cpu pinning)

This patch adds the missing data migration.

The port.resource_request field is admin only. Nova depends on the
value of this field to do a proper scheduling and resource allocation
and deallocation for ports with resource request as well as to update
the port.binding:profile.allocation field with the resource providers
the requested resources are fulfilled from. However in some cases nova
does not use a neutron admin client / elevated context to read the
port. In this case neutron returns None for the port.resource_request
field and nova thinks that the port has no resource request.

This patch fixes all the places where previous testing showed that
context elevation was missing.

the live migration issue is not reproducible as the bug there only

To properly reproduce the bug we need to modify nova's neutron fixture
to act like a real neutron when a port is queried with a non-admin
client.

A wide set of tests are added to exercise all the resource request
dependent nova code paths with a non-admin user.

stable/wallaby: It is not a direct backport from stable/xena due to a
sizable change in the functional tests. But logically this patch tries
to add the same test coverage. However it turned out that not all the
issues exists in stable/wallaby. The interface attach and detach issue
are present but the live migration issue is not present as in the
stable/wallaby code the binding profile update during live migration
does not query neutron. During Xena the query is introduced and with it
the bug as well [1]

We saw in the field that the pci_devices table can end up in
inconsistent state after a compute node HW failure and re-deployment.
There could be dependent devices where the parent PF is in available
state while the children VFs are in unavailable state. (Before the HW
fault the PF was allocated hence the VFs was marked unavailable).

In this state this PF is still schedulable but during the
PCI claim the handling of dependent devices in the PCI tracker fill fail
with the error: ""Attempt to consume PCI device XXX from empty pool"".

The reason of the failure is that when the PF is claimed, all the
children VFs are marked unavailable. But if the VF is already
unavailable such step fails.

One way the deployer might try to recover from this state is to remove
the VFs from the hypervisor and restart the compute agent. The compute
startup already has a logic to delete PCI devices that are unused and
not reported by the hypervisor. However this logic only removed devices
in 'available' state and ignored devices in 'unavailable' state.

If a device is unused and the hypervisor is not reporting the device any
more then it is safe to delete that device from the PCI tracker. So this
patch extends the logic to allow deleting 'unavailable' devices. There
is a small window when dependent PCI device is in 'unclaimable' state.
From cleanup perspective this is an analogous state. So it is also
added to the cleanup logic.

This reverts commit d4651da300838388c3cc2a9d74405077ae6f8c1f.

Reason for revert: This patch has caused couple of issues[1][2][3].
[1][2] are same issue just one is seen in c8/c9-stream and other in
rhel8 and both contains much info about the issue.
[3] is currently happening only in rhel8/rhel9 as this issue is visible
only with the patch in revert and ovn-2021>=21.12.0-55(fix of [4]) which
is not yet available in c8/c9-stream.

[1][2] happens randomly as the patch under revert has moved the
events to SB DB which made a known OVN issue[5] occur more often as in
that issue SB DB Event queue floods with too many events of
PortBindingChassisEvent making other events like PortBindingUpdateUpEvent
to wait much longer and hence triggering VirtualInterfaceCreateException.

NB DB Event queue is different and hence with revert we are trying to
lower the side effect of the OVN issue[5].

This patch can be re reverted once [3] and [5] are fixed.

In addition, getting a dedicated file for nftables content makes things
easier to read, especially with the nftables output (think ""json"", more

- iptables will still be called if the system can't find the

- this patch will be especially important once [1] get in, since

The default wait_timeout inside MariaDB is 8 hours
which means that a connection can remain idle for
up to 8 hours without sending any traffic.

The default proxy_timeout for streams inside Nginx
is set to 10 minutes, which means for a low-volume
environment with a lot of workers, it is possible that
the connection will be prematurely disconnected after
10 minutes.

This patch updates the proxy-stream-timeout to be
8 hours so that it can match the MariaDB value, which
should hopefully eliminate any issues with Nginx
killing connections to early.

As explained in bug#1960346, we need to wait for server to
be fully booted before detach volume is called. Let's add
a wait in attach_volume base method so that we double make
sure server is ready before detach_volume is called either
by test explicitly or via cleanup method. This need create
server method to inject the validation resources in server
by default.

Stable ussuri is in Extended maintenance state[1] and
we need to pin tempest in stable/ussuri testing.

We use Tempest 26.1.0 because of oslo.utils version bump in Tempest
27.0.0 and 28.0.0 which is not compatible with stable/ussuri
upper constraints so these versions do not work in stable/ussuri.
Tempest 26.1.0 version is compatible for ussuri testing from tempest
side as well as from upper constraints side.

This patch adds a helper function that given a number of time units will
calculate how much of a difference to the expected we are happy to accept
in order to make progress. This patch adds the helper method, but
currently isn't used.

The basic idea is given an expected_size and current_size of the shard,
check to see if we can move to CLEAVED.
If the current_size < expected use an exponential formula to see if enough
iterations have passed for us to accept the current size and make progress.

The simple formula is `base ** iterations`, tuned into a percentage of
the expected size that the current_size may have a difference of.

Iterations will be a number of time units, so a bigger difference
is allowed over time. But are in effect what we're raising the power to.
We could make the time unit configurable in seconds. So we could make it
daily. So long as we know when we attempted to cleave (but couldn't
transition) we can then take the difference in time / time units and we
get our iterations number.

As for the base, the following table might help

Revert ""Ensure subports transition to DOWN""
This reverts commit 5e036a6b281e4331f396473e299b26b2537d5322.

Revert ""Ensure only the right events are processed""
This reverts commit 553f462656c2b7ee1e9be6b1e4e7c446c12cc9aa.

Reason for revert: These patches have caused couple of issues[1][2][3].
[1][2] are same issue just one is seen in c8/c9-stream and other in
rhel8 and both contains much info about the issue.
[3] is currently happening only in rhel8/rhel9 as this issue is visible
only with the patch in revert and ovn-2021>=21.12.0-55(fix of [4]) which
is not yet available in c8/c9-stream.

[1][2] happens randomly as the patch under revert has moved the
events to SB DB which made a known OVN issue[5] occur more often as in
that issue SB DB Event queue floods with too many events of
PortBindingChassisEvent making other events like PortBindingUpdateUpEvent
to wait much longer and hence triggering VirtualInterfaceCreateException.

NB DB Event queue is different and hence with revert we are trying to
lower the side effect of the OVN issue[5].

This patch can be re reverted once [3] and [5] are fixed.

The AGENT_RES_PROCESSING_STEP value is 100 (default) which
is the trunk (step) size for the ovs-ofctl bundle installaion.
After some testing, we noticed that if your vswitchd was not
in high CPU load, we can increase it to a higher value.

So this patch refectors this flow installation action to
automatic adjustment. It can start at a step size of 1000
flows, if it meets the timeout exception, divide to half
until meets the smallest size 100.

Inside a chroot, phased updates are disabled [1]. This means that
the container base image always gets the latest packages regardless
of what is happening with the phasing.

At runtime, the default in Ubuntu releases 21.04 and onward is to
obey the package phasing information. This means that packages
inside the OSA built container image can be newer than the installation
candidates once the container is running, leading to installation
errors. This is particularly sensitive with source packages such as
systemd where there is a very tight version coupling between
all components leading to only one valid installation candidate.

This patch creates apt config inside the container base image to
always install the latest package version regardless of phasing.

There does not seem to be any alternative, as phasing is always
disabled during the debootstrap.

ansible-test seems to take the latest ansible-core by default, even if
we push upper/lower constraints in the requirements.txt or

Pushing the constraint directly in the tox.ini, for the ""sanity""
testenv, seems to do the trick, as we're testing against an ansible
version we actually support, instead of the latest (2.13 today).

This patch also takes the opportunity to remove unwanted warnings
(ansible.cfg deprecated options), as well as ensuring the ignored
content for `ansible-test' doesn't raise any warning.

Revert ""Ensure subports transition to DOWN""
This reverts commit 5e036a6b281e4331f396473e299b26b2537d5322.

Revert ""Ensure only the right events are processed""
This reverts commit 553f462656c2b7ee1e9be6b1e4e7c446c12cc9aa.

Reason for revert: These patches have caused couple of issues[1][2][3].
[1][2] are same issue just one is seen in c8/c9-stream and other in
rhel8 and both contains much info about the issue.
[3] is currently happening only in rhel8/rhel9 as this issue is visible
only with the patch in revert and ovn-2021>=21.12.0-55(fix of [4]) which
is not yet available in c8/c9-stream.

[1][2] happens randomly as the patch under revert has moved the
events to SB DB which made a known OVN issue[5] occur more often as in
that issue SB DB Event queue floods with too many events of
PortBindingChassisEvent making other events like PortBindingUpdateUpEvent
to wait much longer and hence triggering VirtualInterfaceCreateException.

NB DB Event queue is different and hence with revert we are trying to
lower the side effect of the OVN issue[5].

This patch can be re reverted once [3] and [5] are fixed.

Per Clark Boylan's feedback [1], retries cause a retry not only
for pre playbook failures but also for cases where Ansible detects
network connectivity issues and they are caused by disks getting
filled to their fullest. This is an issue we experience that
sometimes results in a POST_FAILURE but certain FAILUREs are
retried which wastes CI resources.
The problematic jobs are ceph jobs. They are to be looked into.
Backport to all branches.
We can adjust retries for the core jobs that do not exhibit the
nasty behaviour but first we can try running without retries
to measure the troublesomeness.

Oslo policy introduced 2 config options which are related to the new
""Secure RBAC"" policies and are in most cases used together:
* enforce_new_defaults
* enforce_scope

When I initially worked on new default policies in Neutron I always
set both of them to True together and I wrongly added checking
if enforce_new_defaults is set to True to check or set system_scope
parameter in context object.
As enforce_scope is related to scope actually, it should be set/check
when enforce_scope is enabled, not when enforce_new_defaults is enabled.

This patch fixes that by checking proper config option.

There are a number of tasks and use of the ssh keypair setup role
which must happen on all of the keystone hosts before the service
itself is deployed.

Previously, the keystone role ran with serial (1,100%), and the
pre-service setup tasks iterated over ansible_play_hosts
during the deployment of the first keystone host using delegate_to.
This makes the control flow of the role hard to understand and
causes issues when the pre-service tasks need to include further
roles which also use delegate_to, such as the ssh-keypairs role.

This change introduces a new 'main' tasks file for the pre-service
setup  which can be called independantly with no restriction on
serial:. This means that the pre-service setup can be completed
on all keystone hosts using normal ansible tasks without iteration
or delegate_to, and the role can be called a second time with the usual
main.yml and serial: settings to deploy the service itself and
maintain operation in a H/A deployment. In addition, the behaviour
of --limit will now be more obvious.

Depending on the way the testing script is called, it may sense
stdin being available and not being a tty [1]. The logic in the
Glance part of the client is then broken [2] as it detects both
volume and stdin as sources of the image and fails.
The proposed approach uses the script module for these tests.
This fixes the cephadm upgrade jobs where this script was called
using the shell module which causes this behaviour. The script
module is not affected. FWIW, the command module is affected
the same as shell because shell extends the command module.

Removes multipath base devices from consideration by
default, and instead allows the device-mapper device
managed by multipath to be picked up and utilized
instead.

In effect, allowing us to ignore standby paths *and*
leverage multiple concurrent IO paths if so offered
via ALUA.

In reality, anyone who has previously built IPA with
multipath tooling might not have encountered issues
previously because they used Active/Active SAN storage
environments. They would have worked because the IO lock
would have been exchanged between controllers and paths.
However, Active/Passive environments will block passive
paths from access, ultimately preventing new locks from
being established without proper negotiation. Ultimately
requiring multipathing *and* the agent to be smart enough
to know to disqualify underlying paths to backend storage
volumes.

An additional benefit of this is active/active MPIO devices
will, as long as ``multipath`` is present inside the ramdisk,
no longer possibly result in duplicate IO wipes occuring
accross numerous devices.

Conflicts:
 	neutron/common/ovn/constants.py

Also revert below 2 commits which were added on
top of the parent commit:-

Revert ""Ensure subports transition to DOWN""
This reverts commit 5e036a6b281e4331f396473e299b26b2537d5322.

Revert ""Ensure only the right events are processed""
This reverts commit 553f462656c2b7ee1e9be6b1e4e7c446c12cc9aa.

Reason for revert: These patches have caused couple of issues[1][2][3].
[1][2] are same issue just one is seen in c8/c9-stream and other in
rhel8 and both contains much info about the issue.
[3] is currently happening only in rhel8/rhel9 as this issue is visible
only with the patch in revert and ovn-2021>=21.12.0-55(fix of [4]) which
is not yet available in c8/c9-stream.

[1][2] happens randomly as the patch under revert has moved the
events to SB DB which made a known OVN issue[5] occur more often as in
that issue SB DB Event queue floods with too many events of
PortBindingChassisEvent making other events like PortBindingUpdateUpEvent
to wait much longer and hence triggering VirtualInterfaceCreateException.

NB DB Event queue is different and hence with revert we are trying to
lower the side effect of the OVN issue[5].

This patch can be re reverted once [3] and [5] are fixed.

These sorts of changes should likely be made across all of kolla. I'm
pushing the update to victoria because 843400 is a victoria change that
caused me to look into this.

First up kolla-ansible-centos8s-source-upgrade-ceph-ansible is a
multinode job that retries many times, is non voting, and a check only
job. The value of a job like this on a stable branch is likely minimal.

First we remove the non default attempts value on the base job. You
should set this per job instead only when necessary and after debugging
why jobs retry excessively. Please avoid overriding defaults like this
for all the jobs as it is easy for peopel to forget the setting is in
place.

Next move the job to the experimental queue. If it is non voting and
rarely passes it can be manually triggered by individuals that are
working to correct the job that rarely succeeds. Then once reliable the
job can be added back to the check pipeline.

Depending on the way the testing script is called, it may sense
stdin being available and not being a tty [1]. The logic in the
Glance part of the client is then broken [2] as it detects both
volume and stdin as sources of the image and fails.
The proposed approach disables stdin for these tests.
This fixes the cephadm upgrade jobs where this script was called
using the shell module which causes this behaviour. The script
module is not affected. FWIW, the command module is affected
the same as shell because shell extends the command module.

The Octavia scenario job is a comprehensive CI job that relies on
multiple core OpenStack services like Nova, Neutron, Glance and
Keystone. It also exercises use-cases not test covered by some of these
projects, so having an Octavia CI job in Devstack adds greater value.

Additionally, Octavia is part of the recommended minimal starting set of
OpenStack services for Kubernetes clusters [1].

CentOS 8 is one of three LTS or stable distributions for Victoria [2]
and the most widely used distribution according to the OpenStack User
Survey 2019 [1] with a combined 55% of OpenStack cloud deployments

Should this platform become a gate blocker, the community should either
fix the issue internally when applicable, or report it upstream and
provide a workaround whenever possible. If a workaround is not feasible
and upstream is not responsive, please escalate to CentOS/RHEL
colleagues in the OpenStack community; only after the job could be
turned non-voting (and back to voting once issue is resolved).

These sorts of changes should likely be made across all of kolla. I'm
pushing the update to victoria because 843400 is a victoria change that
caused me to look into this.

First up kolla-ansible-centos8s-source-upgrade-ceph-ansible is a
multinode job that retries many times, is non voting, and a check only
job. The value of a job like this on a stable branch is likely minimal.

First we remove the non default attempts value on the base job. You
should set this per job instead only when necessary and after debugging
why jobs retry excessively. Please avoid overriding defaults like this
for all the jobs as it is easy for peopel to forget the setting is in
place.

Next move the job to the experimental queue. If it is non voting and
rarely passes it can be manually triggered by individuals that are
working to correct the job that rarely succeeds. Then once reliable the
job can be added back to the check pipeline.

If you want to restore a backup, specifying only the backup ID, you will
get a new volume. However, if you pass the volume_id argument, you are
targeting the restore of an existing volume.

The problem I am having is that restore_backup() adds a second call to
addCleanup to an existing volume and this results in a 400 HTTP error.

To fix this problem, I add a simple check when we want to use an
existing volume without calling cleanup.

The type of the input parameter connector is dict, but as I
would like to get connector from volume_ref, the type of the
latter is str which does not comply with the type of the former
. For example, I use a list comprehension which is [a.connector
 for a in volume_ref.volume _attachment] and the elements in the
list belong to the type of str. And in such scenario, if we want
to get some values by key such as 'host', the former can utilize
connect['host'] but the latter can not. That causes a confusion.

Therefore, Modify manner of retrieving volume_ref so that the type
of connector taken from volume_ref is a instance of dict.

Rally ships it's own version of upper-constraints [1].

As we move openstack-ansible to using the new pip resolver this
causes several issues. The rally specific version of u-c contains
constraints for pip/setuptools/wheel which will inevitably be in
conflict with those in global-requirement-pins. This results in
several problems.

* Rally is branchless and so applying branch-specific versions
  of openstack u-c is incorrect

* Rally should be installed using the rally u-c rather than
  openstack u-c

* Rally should not use the repo server to build wheels as the repo
  server wheel build venv will have different versions of pip/
  setuptools/wheel to those specificed in rally u-c.

* Rally venv build should not be subject to openstack-ansible
  global-requirement-pins as these are in conflict with rally u-c.

This patch introduces the changes necessary to build rally in a self
contained manner on the utility host with no use of the repo server.
It also includes a revert of I73887784cbc3ce6089a42c67871dbc6c3d54acf6.

It's possible for a volume's node name to be `None` (because an
API is not present, or the user doesn't have privileges, for example).
For these cases, computing the QOS name can lead to a TypeError, since
it needs to concatenate a prefix to the node name. This patchset fixes
this problem by returning an empty string for the QOS if the node name
is indeed None.

Configure the four paramters (public_network, cluster_network,
ms_bind_ipv4 and ms_bind_ipv6) in cephadm_config_set.yaml tasks
file instead of in ceph.conf.j2 template.

If a user overrides the tripleo_cephadm_assimilate_conf file
to provide their own initial Ceph configuration file without
any network configuration, then we don't want to loose the
network configuration that would have been set from the
ceph.conf.j2 template. Thus, we'll ensure the correct network
configuration can happen even if the ceph.conf.j2 template is
not used.

If the tripleo_cephadm_assimilate_conf file contains any of
the four parameters, then those parameters will not be set
via cephadm_config_set.yaml tasks. This allows users to
still override the four parameters via the --config option.

The cephadm_config_set.yaml tasks are always called by the
apply_spec.yaml tasks before the spec is applied. Thus, we'll
know the correct networks are set before any other daemons are
added with the exception of the first bootstrapped mon/mgr
daemons. The public_network for them is set implicitly via the
--mon-ip option.

Recently default Neutron's backend in Devstack was changed to ML2/OVN
and that caused some failures of the osc-functional-devstack job.

In [1] we explicitly configured ML2/OVS Neutron backend to be still used
in that functional tests job to unblock our gate.

But we should really run that job with Devstack's default settings.
So, as functional tests issues which were causing failures on the
ML2/OVN backend are now fixed, this patch switches
osc-functional-devstack job to the Devstack's defaults (ML2/OVN).
But to ensure that we have some coverage as we had before, this patch
also adds new job osc-functional-devstack-neutron-ovs which runs Neutron
with ML2/OVS backend to be able to test e.g. some DHCP/L3 agents API
which aren't available when OVN is used.

Patch fixing bug #1861071 resolved the issue of extending LUKS v1
volumes when nova connects them via libvirt instead of through os-brick,
but nova side still fails to extend in-use volumes when they don't go
through libvirt (i.e., LUKS v2).

The logs will show a very similar error, but the user won't know that
this has happened and Cinder will show the new size:

 libvirt.libvirtError: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command
 'block_resize': Cannot grow device files

There are 2 parts to this problem:

- The device mapper device is not automatically extended.
- Nova tries to use the encrypted block device size as the size of the
  decrypted device.

This patch leverages the ""extend_volume"" method in os-brick connectors
to extend the device mapper device, after the encrypted device has been
extended, and use the size of the decrypted volume for the block_resize
operation.

Follow-up the vnc server key file data race and fix it for Nova VNC
proxy key and cert files as well.

The race condition described in
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1759281
might also apply to other files created by getcert, it seems.

Getcert sets owner and permissions for newly created cert/key files
to root/0600. While it retaines that unchanged for already existing
cert/key files.

By the certmonger feature design, changes to a service key file
resource trigger a getcert execution. And once it finishes for
novnc_proxy key file, we need to enforce the expected permissions/owner
for that file. Puppet would not allow doing such circular notifications
normally, so we add execs before/after the getcmd command.

Make sure that puppet resets novnc_proxy key file permissions
after (and only after) getcert finishes its tasks and stores the
generated cert file.

If the key's content change has been audited by puppet, remove the no
longer relevant cert file, so that getcert could re-issue it, and then
puppet to properly re-apply permissions/owner on both files.

If we do not remove the cert file before running getcert, the guarding
exec might finish before getcert finishes (see the former race
condition details). If we set the guarding exec watching for the key
file, it might also finish before getcert finishes. So we have to
set it watching for the cert file, and purge it before issuing getcert.
If the key content does not change, the cert file will be retained.

Also set the service_certificate group to match it for the
service_key as both are expected to have it the same.

Finally, when the service key permissions have been changed by the exec
command, puppet will only audit that change on the next run, via its
corresponding File[$service_key] resource. That may leave the created
cert file with wrong permissions, until the next puppet run. So
make sure that exec changes both the cert and key file permissions in
a single transaction. That additional change is also needed for
VNC server cert file permissions handling, so add it into this patch
scope.

For some reason, the stable/newton branch for ceilometermiddleware was
not EOLed at the timing of Newton EOL. This change creates the eol tag
so that we can drop the branch.

There is the opendev migration patch[1] merged since the last release
but that one was merged far after Newton EOL deadline. Because
newton-eol of the other repos does not include the change, it is
intentionally ignored by this release.

The previous attempts at fixing the job were not successful yet, it
seems the variable in the pre playbook isn't overridden by a job
variable. Since the other uses of this job are running with ubuntu-focal
anyway, set the list of available python interpreters in the playbook
directly and remove the modifications from the requirements specific job
again. Also pin the nodeset for this job to guard against changes in the
base job, which will likely require another change to the interpreter
list.

In order to get both [1] and [2] fixed, we set
`net.ipv6.conf.all.addr_gen_mode=1` in HA router namespace to
prevent auto-assigning link-local address(lla) to the interfaces.
We don't need lla auto-assignment as keepalived manages them.
With this change, we will have link-local addresses only on active
router, which will prevent 'dadfailed' and MLD packets will not be
sent from standby router.

Previously we also reverted [3] to always keep qg-* interface up on both
active&standby router's instance, no matter if keepalived is started or
not.
Without link-local address assigned, backup router's instance won't
send any packets, so I see no reason to keep qg-* interface down.

This patch fixes 2 issues related to the symlinks, or lack of, that
connectors' connect_volume methods return.

Some connectors always return the block device instead of a symlink for
encrypted volumes, and other connectors return a symlink that is owned
by the system's udev rules.  Both cases are problematic

Returning the real device can prevent the encryptor connect_volume to
complete successfully, and in other cases (such as nvmeof) it completes,
but on the connector's disconnect volume it will leave the device behind
(i.e., /dev/nvme0n1) preventing new connections that would use that same
device name.

Returning a symlink owned by the system's udev rules means that they can
be reclaimed by those rules at any time.  This can happen with
cryptsetup, because when it creates a new mapping it triggers udev rules
for the device that can reclaim the symlink after os-brick has replaced
it.

This patch creates a couple of decorators to facilitate this for all
connectors. These decorators transform the paths so that the callers
gets the expected symlink, but the connector doesn't need to worry about
it and will always see the value it returns regardless of what symlink
the caller gets.

From this moment onwards we use our own custom symlink that starts with
""/dev/disk/by-id/os-brick"".

The patch fixes bugs in other connectors (such as the RBD local
connection), but since there are no open bugs they have not been
reported.
