This patch adds appropriate attribute to SchemaProperty class and a
helper method which allows to validate if the given property is base or 
not.

The added helper method (is_base_property) should not be confused with
the existing is_core_property: the latter just checks if the property is
known to the schema, regardless of its being base or not.

This patch updates the QoS OVS driver to work with policy NeutronObjects
that are passed by the agent extension manager, instead of lists of rule
dicts, as we originally expected.  It also adds validation that the
rules that are sent by the neutron-server are actually supported by the
backend.

Finally, port dict was not really enough to determine the name of the
port in ovsdb. 'name' field is not really present in all port dicts, and
does not reflect what is known to ovs anyway. So instead, we should
rely on vif_port object to determine the ovs port name. Since ovs agent
only added the vif_port value to details dict when binding was desired,
I made adding the vif_port object unconditional, and covered that fact
with unit tests.

With this patch in place, I was able to get policy rules applied to a
port in devstack installation. Functional tests will belong to a
follow-up.

This patch creates an L3 plugin service for midonet and moves
the handlers for router and fip operations to the new service.

This has the following implications:
* If plugin_v2 is being used, then in order to get L3 functionality,
  you must also configure the l3 plugin as a ""service_plugin"".
* If plugin (v1) is being used, then you must not configure
  ""service_plugin"" with the l3 plugin. They both implement the ""router""
  extension and therefore can not both be loaded at the same time.

Changes:
plugin_v2.py: Remove router and fip functionality
plugin.py: l3 nat mixin is removed from the base and moved to the mixin
l3_midonet.py: Add router and fip functionality
test_midonet_plugin_v2.py: configure the service_plugin
local.conf.sample: add configuration options to stack with the l3 service
loadbalancer_db.py: use the l3 plugin instead of the core plugin when
  accessing the router objects

Kolla spent 4 IRC meeting hours defining the Kolla mission here [1].
Our mission is clear and well defined.

Kolla provides production-ready containers and deployment tools for
operating OpenStack clouds.

The project uses the ASL 2.0 as declared in the code base [2].

The PTL was chosen by election to be Steven Dake using the standard
OpenStack mechanism [3].

The #kolla IRC channel on freenode is logged and the channel is
notified of such logging [4].  Our public meeting schedule was
decided by vote at [5] and all meeting logs are stored at our wiki.

The project uses public code reviews on the OpenStack infrastructure.
Kolla has been using the +2/+A process requiring two unique core
reviewers to review a patch since project inception.  Our project
does not permit exceptions to the +2/+A process and we have never
approved a patch without two core reviews.

Our gating runs pep8, bashate, and other YAML/JSON syntax checking.
The Kolla team builds all images as a functional CI job to validate
our builds.  In nearly every IRC meeting for the Liberty cycle
continuous integration has been our second topic of discussion.

The PTL serves as liaison between the Kolla community and other
projects for example coordinating our container content with James
Slagle, the TripleO PTL.  Because Kolla deploys most OpenStack
namespaced server projects, we must coordinate and cooperate with
nearly every server project in OpenStack.

The project has openly worked with members of the TripleO community
to integrate kolla/containers into TripleO.  Several PoC patches
exist demonstrating TripleO and Kolla integration [6].

During Paris ODS, we had a one hour design session recorded here [7].
The Kolla team had an open design session at Vancouver ODS during
Ansible Collaboration day.  TripleO hosted several Kolla design
sessions at Vancouver ODS.  We discuss all work in the open, mostly
using IRC.  Based upon open communication between the Kolla core
reveiwer and developement team, the PTL presented the long-term
vision for Kolla during Liberty ODS [8].

Kolla uses IRC very heavily because everyone is very active on IRC.
As a result the Kolla core reviewer team often makes quick decisions.
Our core reviewer team is distributed around the world, so we use the
mailing list to communicate long term planning objectives.  A recent
example of such is the recently held Kolla-Palooza midcycle meetup
on July 28th and July 29th, 2015.  We use the mailing list by
prefixing e-mails to openstack-dev@lists.openstack.org with [kolla]
for long term planning rather than short term decision making.

Kolla has a high degree of diversity in both reviews [9] and
commits [10] with our largest percentage of contributions
originating from unaffiliated contributors.

This commit should have been done right at the branching of the kilo
devstack branch. It hard codes the list of extensions to ensure that
when we run master tempest in the gate against different branches only
tests that require the use of a new extension are run on newer
branches. This commit is generated by spinning up a devstack kilo
cloud and running the tempest command:

verify-tempest-config -u -r -o $PATH

to generate a tempest config file with the complete extension list at
$PATH. Then using those lists set the default value for the config
options.

Commit cb60d0bb4e0cc0cba68f59fdf5f4e89d6ec52950 added an expand
migration. Howewer it indicated a contract migration as its
ancestor (2a16083502f3). As a result the migration was treated
by alembic as a contract one, even if it was defined in the
'expand' directory.

This patch 'rebases' this migration on top of the expand branch
HEAD. This might impact trunk chasers which have already executed
migration 1c844d1677f7 as a part of the contract branch.

Now that there is a devstack plugin for VPN, and the tests that
the VPN functional tests that use DSVM use this plugin, we need
to remove the enabling of q-vpn from other DSVM based jobs so
that they don't use the service.

This has two benefits. First, we are not enabling the service
all the time (and then not really testing it). Second, it will
allow us to remove all the VPN setup from the DevStack project,
completing the migration to an external plugin.

An HA port needs to point to the correct host (where the master router
is running) in order for L2Population to work.

Hence, this patch introduces two fixes:
* When a port owned by an HA router is up we make sure it points to the
  right node where the master is running, or a random node if there is
  no master yet (This corner case is fixed by the 2nd bullet point).

* When a L3 agent reports it's hosting a master, we need to update the
  port binding to the host the master is now running on. This fixes
  both routers with no elected master (Yet) and failovers.

This patch also changes the L3 HA failover test to use l2pop.
Note that the test does not pass when using l2pop without this patch.

Having the data validation happening inside the unit tests makes
understanding requirement update failures confusing because the output
is hard to read and does not explain what the error actually is. Move
the checks to their own command and set up a tox env to run it. A
separate patch in project-config will add a new job for the repository.

This uncovered a couple other places where we were still passing a
context to a remotable method (in tests), which are fixed up here.

There is also a bug in ovo's remotable decorator that requires dict
compatibility. For this reason, this patch adds the Dict mixin to
a few objects (with appropriate comments), which can be removed when
we have an ovo release with that fix in it.

This adds a deactivate_lv method and calls it prior to
issuing the extend call. If auto_activation_volume_list
is not defined lvm.conf, then volumes will be reactivated
automatically after the extend.  If auto_activation_volume_list
is defined, then volumes that should be automatically
reactivated should be added to the auto_activation_volume_list
or they won't be activated automatically.
NOTE: This doesn't apply to thin provisioned LVs as they don't
require the deactivation step.

DocImpact: When a user extends LVM Volumes with a snapshot, the
volumes will be deactivated.  Their re-activation is automatic,
unless auto_activation_volume_list is defined in lvm.conf.
See lvm.conf for more info.  Thin provisioned LVM Volumes
will not be deactivated as they don't require it.

During rescue mode the auto_disk_config value is pulled from the rescue
image if provided.  The value is a string but it was being used as a
boolean in an 'if' statement, leading it to be True when it shouldn't
be.  This converts it to a boolean value before comparison.

This does the majority of the work towards getting NovaObject to be based on
oslo.versionedobjects' VersionedObject. It removes most of the meat of
NovaObject so that we use the equivalent methods in VersionedObject. It makes
minimal changes to the tests to show that the functionality is the same.
There are a few things still overridden in NovaObject that need less obvious
changes, which will come in subsequent patches, along with changes to drop
tests which are now redundant with o.vo coverage.

NetworkManager.update_range_mask_from_cidr ignores a gateway if it is
used in a network group. The patch adds the use_gateway parameter to the
function to properly select the first address of a range.

NetworkManager.update_networks does not check a notation of IP ranges
properly and due to the fact that the order of an iteration through
items depends on implementation of the dict type in Python we have that
the _set_ip_ranges method can occure after the
update_range_mask_from_cidr method and overrides proper ranges. The
patch removes logic for choosing an appropriate method from the loop.

The Linux bridge VXLAN supported check was only checking that the
test interface didn't exist instead of checking that both the interface
and the VXLAN didn't exist. This caused it to fail on startup if
a VXLAN interface existed under a different name using one of the
VXLANs that the agent tried to test support with.

This patch adds a check to ensure that the VXLAN ID isn't in use as well.

Debugging a kernel oops or other issues where jenkins drops connection
with the host is very difficult.  The console screen requires one of
the friendly infra-* staff to examine, but even then it's small and
can scroll off important information or blank out.  Also, if you're
killing the network connection you're left with no information what
might be going on in the host.

After hitting this issue recently, I did some change-specific stuff to
setup a netconsole on the host and send the logs out that way.  It
ended up working well and gave me a full backtrace of the oops, which
cut down the debugging time considerably.

This wraps the setup into a function so you just need to specify
DEVSTACK_GATE_NETCONSOLE=123.123.123.123:6666 and it will setup the
host to send logs there.  It is intended for short-term use while
you're debugging specific problems with a job.

Currently, when using pacemaker we follow a common pattern: tell puppet
not to manage the service and to not enable it at boot.

Situation summarize to :

  * If Pacemaker is enabled every service should not be managed by
    puppet neither started on boot

  * If Pacemaker is not enabled keep puppet managing those services and
    allow them to start at boot.

This commit relies on three new parameters to tell services which
behavior to adopt:

  * ServiceManage

Previously when you set $configure_endpoint to false and did not have a
keystone_endpoint resource with the same name as is defined by
neutron::keystone::auth, the catalog would not be compiled. This was
because a relationship was being established where one resource in the
relationship didn't exist. This changes this so that the relationship
involving the Keystone endpoint is only defined if $configure_endpoint
is set to true.

Before, when running the Exec which restart Keystone service, we used
$service_name but this is wrong because service_name can be keystone,
openstack-keystone or httpd.
On Ubuntu/Debian, Apache service name is not httpd but apache2.

So the service could never be restarted if we were 1/ running
Ubuntu/Debian 2/ changing the default domain name.

This patch looks up in puppetlabs-apache the real Apache service name
when $service_name is httpd (if WSGI is enabled and eventlet disabled).

That way, we are sure the service name that will be used will the right
one.
Also add some unit tests that validate this change.

be retiring in the future.  Additionally, we move into centos7 to

If the subprocess.Popen.communicate method raises an exception,
the on_completion callback is never invoked. If a caller is
trying to use on_execute + on_completion to track lifecycle
of a process this creates a problem, as they cannot reliably
detect completion.

This changes it so that sudo is used during the building
phase so that `rpmbuild` can run without issue and removes the
building stage from the venv building jobs as its not needed
anyway (virtualenv building doesn't take advantage of the
separated building stage anyway).

Before if an exception occured during dsl cleanup exception_result would
use empty ObjectsCopy and empty Attributes for result. In case exception
happened during env deletion this would cause env to be deleted by API,
because it ignored isException and treated any result as valid.

Now exception_result also includes original ObjectsCopy/Attributes in case
they're empty in exception_result.
Api not only checks count of 'error' statuses, in session, but also
checks isException attribute of the result, and treats exception results
as Errors, therefore marking deployment/deletion as failed.

Logging of results in API is now aware, that objects can be empty during
app deletion and no longer throws AttributeError because of that.

 - glance image

Current patch adds two new methods to base class:
 * _resolve_all_attributes - for choosing path for resolving, which
   depends on type of attribute (base or custom).
 * _show_resource - method for resolving base 'show' attribute.
 This method should be re-defined for resources, which use clients with
 specific implementations of 'show' commands.

 New attribute for base class was added - entity, which is used for
 resolving 'show' attribute.

 Tests for Neutron resources and Server resource were updated
 corresponding changes mentioned above.

 Hook for stack_resource class is removed in this patch.

It was possible to lose all edges when if subgraph was created
with skipped tasks.
For example, if we have path a -> b -> c.
And b will be marked as skipped - there is no way to guarantee
that a will be executed earlier than c.

After this patch traversal will be done using all tasks and
after that filtered tasks will be skipped from sending them

The gabbi live tests was ignored during the gate run.

Due to ""openstack endpoint list"" that returns a empty list:

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1470635

And because the token wasn't passed to gabbit tests.

This change fixes that.

It also ensures that the gabbi live test fail
if service url is not present.

Remove ironic.conf.sample and add it to the .gitignore file.

The /details api provides details about the amphora VM.
It reads the interface's statistics file
/sys/class/net/{interface}/statistics/{type}_bytes
to collect all the stats. While doing so it tries to read the
stat files of the virtual interfaces like eth0:1 also,
which are not available and throws an exception. This
fix excludes virtual interfaces while collecting the
stats by checking whether the interface name has : in it

* convert map to list in heat.engine.api. This is done because stacks
  are garbage collected once we go out of scope using weakrefs. However,
  in python 3, since everything is lazily loaded, when we iterate over
  the stack['resources'] iterable, we end up referencing the previously
  garbage collected stack object. So resolve everything before returning
  the list.
* sort the __repr__ of dependencies to return a consistent string
* Don't encode support_status. There is no need to encode it. Without
* this, in py3, we'd effectively be comparing a unicode string to byte string
  and thus breaking the environment.get_types() API partially.
* test_case: explcitly cast strings to int before comparing them with integers.
* test_case: use a more accurate sorted expression

The test_engine_service.StackServiceTest.test_resource_schema
intermittently fails because the attributes_schema class
variable of a respective resource which the resource schema
method invokes isn't always consistent.

Since the resource_schema method doesn't invoke the __init__
method of the class, the attributes_schema isn't always
updated with the base_attributes_schema dict. In some
cases, the dict is probably updated by some other test
and because resource schema retreives the classes
from the environment, it is likely retreiving the
class which had it's __init__ invoked by some other test case
and thus it's attribute_schema appropriately updated causing
the test to pass. Notice how running only that test case results
in failure always.

Since the attributes_schema class variable of each resource
overrides the base class's attributes_schema, there doesn't
seem a way to update the schema until we do an __init__
without updating every resource to include it's
base_attribute_schema.

So, just update the existing attributes schema manually
with base_attributes_schema for the resource_schema method.

The gateway IP for a subnet is not allowed to be listed in the
allocation pool for that subnet. This restriction is checked and
enforced at subnet-create time.

During subnet-update, it is only partially checked. An
exception is returned if the update request tries to place the gateway
IP in an existing allocation pool OR if both gateway and allocation
pool are being changed and the gateway is located in the new pool.

If only the allocation pool is being updated, no check is made to
verify that the new allocation pool does not contain the existing
gateway IP.

Currently, if we:
1. Boot an instance from volume.
2. Create an image of this volume-backended instance using nova
image-create.
3. Create a new volume using this image.
4. Boot an instance using this newly created volume.

The instance create action will fail.

This is because in the metadata of the volume built using snapshot
contains 'block_device_mapping' values, but instead of saving it as
dict, cinder saved it as string when creating this volume. When nova
tries to read and update them, exception will throw. And also, when
booting form volume, the BDM is provided through REST API.

The current implementation allows resize down is an instance is
booted using bootable volume. The current check is in driver.py
Which is considered not a good implementation.

And also the current check is not good enough. The current check
only check flavor['root_gb'] with instance.root_gb to see whether
it is a resize down. And allowing down resize with flavor with
smaller root_gb than volume size. But when creating an instance
with bootable volume with a flavor has less root_gb than volume
size, it will fail.

This patch add checks of resize down in API layer and also change
the check of flavor['root_gb'] with instance.root_gb to volume
size.

This commit stops using the sample config file as the base for tempest
configuration. The sample config isn't actually needed as a based for
configuration because all the options are commented out so from the
perspective of the config parser it's a blank file.

There are 2 reasons for making this change, first using the sample
like this creates a hard dependency on tempest having a sample config
file in tree. This is something that the project wants to change since
keeping the file in sync causes headaches because of new oslo
releases. The second aspect is that it makes the generated output
difficult to read. It includes *every* option and it's description in
the generated output which makes finding where devstack is actually
setting something more difficult to find.

Prior to Django 1.7, assertContains and assertNotContains test helper
methods behaved differently regarding the 'streaming' flag of a
response. This patch fixes the override I made earlier by calling it
conditionally only for the Django version prior to 1.7. This should
prevent problems with response._charset attribute that no longer works
in Django 1.8

The absolute path causes failures when installing in a virtual

This change solves the installation in a virtual environment,
but it does not fix yet the tempest init workflow when installing
into a virtual environment.

This effectively disables qos extension in the OVS agent, but we don't
rely on it in any functional or fullstack tests so far.

To enable the extension, a user should add:

[agent]
extensions = qos

to their openvswitch_agent.ini file.
