After adding the upgrade step to migrate keystone under httpd, we
left two small races in process:
1) The first race could result in the following error:
Graceful restart requested, doing restart (98)Address already in use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address 192.0.2.14:35357

This is likely caused by removing the keystone resource and
changing constraints in a single pacemaker CIB transaction.
We are not guaranteed that pacemaker will first remove keystone
and then attempt to restart httpd due to the changed constraints.
To address this we unmanage the httpd resource before the constraint
changes and we remanage it later.

2) The second race is because after the cib-push we were not
guaranteed that the later upgrade step that reloads the httpd
configuration via 'systemctl reload httpd' was run after
httpd was started everywhere and we could get the following error:
07 07:51:14 overcloud-controller-0 systemd[1]: Unit httpd.service cannot be reloaded because it is inactive.

We add a check_resource httpd started after we remanage the httpd
resource, in order to guarantee that the httpd resource is up and
running at this point.

This should also fix RHBZ: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1348831

The dummy openstack-core resource was meant to replace keystone so that
restarting keystone would not restart the whole cloud. When this
resource was introduced the paramter interleave=true was mistakenly left
out.

This causes a simple promote operation on the galera resource to restart
openstack-core and its children.

The change in master is done in puppet-tripleo because the resource
creation for the dummy resource was put there.

Add a nova-manage command to make Nova gracefully clean up its own
attachment records when volumes are stuck in 'attaching' or 'detaching'
status.
This command will call the compute manager detach volume via rpc.
We want deliberately skip all the checks performed by
the nova API ""detach_volume"" as those checks prevent the deletion of the
volume records.
The idea is that operators should use this command in order to clean-up
the nova block device mapping table when a volume is stuck in a
'*-ing' status.
At the moment the only way to clean-up this situation is to manually
amend the DB.

With the fixes for the galera root password:
- python-tripleoclient: https://review.openstack.org/317542
- tripleo-heat-template: https://review.openstack.org/316297

we added the MysqlClustercheckPassword property which sets the password
for the clustercheck user. When a user runs a minor update via ""openstack
overcloud update"" he will get the following error:

    Property error: resources[1].properties: Property MysqlClustercheckPassword not assigned

This happens because the new property does not yet have a set value.
This new property is not set unless we do an ""overcloud deploy"", because
the tripleoclient code generating the passwords does not get invoked
during a minor update.

We want to make sure that it has a value set. It is not used during a
minor update in any case but heat does require it.

Since the process of fixing the galera root password requires a full
overcloud deploy command anyway, it is okay to give the
MysqlClustercheckPassword property a default empty value. Upgrades are
not affected because they do run a a full overcloud deploy command.

Currently when operating on quotas in a nested
hierarchical environment, the calling project context
must be a member of the same hierarchy as the target
project in order to be authorized, even if it has the
admin role. This is a change in behavior for users who
are used to being able to view and modify any project
quotas as admin without needing a token scoped to the
target project's hierarchy.

This patch allows projects with the cloud admin role to
be able to operate on all project quotas regardless of
its place in project hierarchy.

* This change will guarantee consistency between playbooks when
  executing common tasks which are generally used to setup services.

* This change greatly reduces code duplication across all plays.

* The common-task files have comments at the top for developer
  instructions on how a task file can be used.

HPE3PAR driver keeps a filestore fsquota to limit the space
available to all the nested shares. This fsquota should not
be decremented when read-only shares are removed. In this case
3PAR read-only shares are only used when the files exist in a
snapshot or in a read-write share. So the read-only share
itself does not hold any space. If a read-write share is
removed, then the decrement happens.

deletion policy is respected by the CLUSTER_DEL_NODES action and the
NODE_DELETE action. For the latter one, we will change desired_capacity
only if the following conditions are all met:
 1. node has a cluster ID;
 2. the action is originated from RPC request instead from a CLUSTER_xxx
    action;
 3. the 'reduce_desired_capacity' is not set to False by the policy.

that file also relies on code from cinder/tests/unit/api/fakes.py.

A few FutureWarnings remain but they stem from functional code (e.g.
comma separated strings of CG IDs stored in the DB as UUIDs and the

Functional code changes will be done in other commits.

Cinder currently has the ability to take over the management of
existing volumes and snapshots (""manage existing"") and to relinquish
management of volumes and snapshots (""unmanage""). The API to manage an
existing volume takes a reference, which is a driver-specific string
that is used to identify the volume on the storage backend.  This
patch adds APIs for listing volumes and snapshots available for
management to make this flow more user-friendly.

In order to support HA Active-Active configurations we need to make some
changes to the way jobs get distributed, now we'll have a new concept

This is mainly for c-vol nodes, but will also help c-bak nodes now that
they have been decoupled from c-vol.

So all ""nodes"" that share the same ""host"" must have the same
configuration so they can service the same backends.  They must also
have a unique ""node_name"" within the ""host"".

This patch adds new API functionality related to service nodes, it makes
changes to the service API and also adds a new entry point for nodes,
using microversion 3.2.

With these changes ""os-services"" listing supports optional argument
`node_detail` that specifies if we want to receive a detailed list of
the nodes for each service.

On service list the response will contain new fields `id`, `num_nodes`,
`num_down_nodes` and `last_heartbeat` indicating the total number of
nodes that are giving service under that host, the number of nodes that
are down, and when the last heartbeat was received from any of those
nodes.

If `node_detail` is set to a true value then we'll return a `nodes`
field which will contain a list of the nodes with the `name`, the
`state` and `heartbeat`.

As for the new ""servicenodes"" API endpoint, it supports show, index,
detail.

Index and detail support filtering by `host`, `service_id`, `binary`,
`disabled` status, and up/down status (`is_up`) using URL parameters.

No update is possible on service nodes since all fields come from the
configuration or the code itself.

show returns:
    ""node"": {
        'id': ...,

This patch adds a new table called service_nodes with its ORM
representation and related operations.

This is part of the effort to support HA A/A in c-vol nodes.

For each service we will have a list of nodes that form that host group
(cluster).

To support rolling upgrades (nodes of successive versions must be able
to work together with the same DB) we consider that a service is up if
in the service table the created_at or updated_at are within the allowed
range (as we were doing before), but also if it has at least one node
that has the updated_at within allowed range.

In the case where both the san_ip and the storwize_san_secondary_ip
are both enabled and both fail to execute a ssh command, no
exceptions are raised.

This patch fixes this issue by creating a helper function to switch
the IP that _run_ssh is using and moving the code into a try/except
block.

Unit tests were also added to make sure all exceptions are covered.

This is the start of an effort to both validate that drivers fully
implement the expected minimum requirements as well as to create a clear
place for driver developers to learn what needs to be implemented and get
documentation explaining what is expected for each method.

This also enables us to create tooling for documenting the available
drivers and their capabilities, to some degree. A follow up patch will
show some of what I'm thinking there, but it will make it possible to write
scripts for different needs.

This is somewhat a cleanup attempt to the ABC work that was started a
while back. This does not aim to replace that effort, but give a
mechanism for some of the things expected out of that effort that ended
up not being possible with how it evolved.

In most cases we do not really care if a driver is inherited from a
certain base class, just that it conforms to the given interface.

The interface/inheritance work really centers around two separate
things:

 * Ensuring drivers conform to an expected interface
 * Allowing code reuse and common implementation

This is really for the first item. Additional work is needed to complete
the ABC work we've done, but that really focuses on the second item, and
is out of scope for the intent of this patch.

The volumes (virtual disks) are created on datastores connected to
ESX hosts in vCenter clusters. Currently we create a list of hosts,
filter out hosts in maintenance mode (using one vCenter API call per
host), and then iterate over the filtered list to select a datastore
which is mounted to maximum number of ESX hosts. Ties are broken
based on space utilization.

This approach is not scalable for vCenter installations with large
number of ESX hosts. Also, we always consider the ESX hosts in the
same order and may end up selecting the same set of datastores. This
patch fixes these issues with the datastore selection. It creates a
list of all datastores in vCenter, which is then filtered to remove
unusable datastores and datastores not satisfying the volume requir-
ements. Finally, we select a datastore from the filtered list based
on the number of ESX hosts to which it is mounted and space utiliza-
tion.

This patch adds support for a volume format, which can
be used for containers in Virtuozzo Server.

This format is different from qcow2 images, because it consists
of 2 or more files in a directory.

The first file is an xml description of a bundle. It includes
paths to base image and deltas, which usually stored in the same
directory. Here is a description of base/delta images format -
https://openvz.org/Ploop/format.

Format name is a little ambiguous, because ploop is not only an
image format name, but also a technology, which allows to use
images, stored in files as block devices (like loop devices or
qemu-nbd), but it supports snapshots and has nearly native
performance. qemu-img has limited support of this format - it
can only convert image files, the format is called 'parallels'
in qemu-img.

The main utility to manage such disks is 'ploop'. Here is a man
page - https://static.openvz.org/vz-man/man8/ploop.8.gz.html.
It can create images, make snapshots and create ploop devices,
based on images.

This patch series makes possible all volume operations except for
snapshotting of 'in-use' volumes.

This change adds a new enum and field, SnapshotStatus and
SnapshotStatusField, that will hold the constants for the 'status'
field of the SnapshotStatus object. This enum and field are based
off the base oslo.versionedobjects enum and field. This also changes
over the Snapshot object to use the new field and bumps up the version
so newer versions know to enforce valid values. Finally, all uses of
strings for comparison and assignment to this field are changed over
to use the constants defined within the enum.

Since overlayfs is now part of the mainstream kernel, it makes sense
to take advantage of it to speed up the container creation process.

While on Ubuntu Trusty (kernel < 3.14) this is not a great idea for
production, the pre-mainline implementation of overlayfs should be
fine for the AIO use-case as it greatly improves the setup time for
the AIO and none of the container data in an AIO is anything we
need to care about too deeply (the data we care about is bind-mounted
to the host anyway).

This patch updates all the roles to the latest available SHA's,
updates all the OpenStack Service SHA's and also updates the
appropriate python requirements pins.

This patch also includes the following changes to unblock the gate.

* os_.* services need RabbitMQ connection config The
  *_rabbitmq_host_group vars.

* Recent changes in the os_nova role require us to bump all of the
  SHAs to support a more updated newton release.

* changes to ""get-pypi-pkg-version.py"" were required because pypi
  no longer allows http requests.

* The ""repo_build_pip_no_binary"" capability has been added to the
  AIO to support a fully capable ""libvirt-python"" library which is
  required by nova. This ensures that the OpenStack-Infra provided
  wheels are not used as they are compiled without the right C
  libraries on the host.

* Ansible is configured to use ssh instead of 'smart' connections
  and to use a shorter timeout. This change is made to improve the
  reliability and speed of connections and to prevent flip-flopping
  between ssh and paramiko connectivity.

* ""ansible_ssh_extra_args"" are set in group_vars/all to improve
  performance.

will force all of the other unaffected devices to be

the ports on the server side to go back into BUILD which
can cause failures in tests expecting ACTIVE ports.

Currently the driver will use the pypowervm code to start a VNC
Repeater that makes available remote access to the LinuxVNC
sessions started by mkvterm.  However, there is no authentication
or encryption done at all on these connections, so anyone that has
access through the firewall can connect to these sessions and also
possibly have access to the unencrypted data sent across.

Support was recently added to pypowervm for optionally specifying
an x509 certificate/key that will be used for x509/TLS security
authentication between the client and the VNC Repeater to allow
for authentication and encrypted transmission.  The VNC Repeater
will continue to communicate with the LinuxVNC session locally
without authentication or encryption.

If a x509 certificate/key is specified, the VNC Repeater will
enforce that the client negotiates to use VeNCrypt as part of
the security handshake and then will wrapper the socket to use
TLS 1.2 for secure communication.

This changeset will add optional configuration properties for the
nova-powervm driver for whether to use x509 authentication and the
certificates to use for this authentication.

 vnc_use_x509_auth - Whether to use x509 authentication for VNC
 vnc_ca_certs - Path to CA certificates for VNC authentication
 vnc_server_cert - Path to the server cert for VNC authentication
 vnc_server_key - Path to the server key for VNC authentication

Heat needs stack_user_domain_id or stack_user_domain_name config

doesn't need to exist until a stack is actually created, but the
value needs to be there. This patch ensures that the heat domain

the services and Puppet will create the domains.

For quite some time we've only tested CentOS7 in upstream CI, and I've
got feedback from several folks trying to run upstream builds on RHEL
saying it doesn't work due to repo/dependency issues.

Given that much of the content (specifically image building and use of
instack-virt-setup) isn't tested in downstream e.g RDO builds etc
anymore either (due to moving towards tripleo-quickstart and the
new yaml image building stuff), lets just stop confusing users and
only document what we actually test in upstream CI.

This patch changes glance-image to be saved as Sheepdog snapshot.

It reduces operations for creating cinder volume from glance-image
when glance and cinder use the same Sheepdog cluster.

Before:
 - Create a temporary snapshot from volume which is saved
   for glance-image
 - Clone a volume from a temporary snapshot
 - Delete a temporary snapshot

After:
 - Create a volume from the snapshot which is saved
   for glance-image

Please see the clone_image method of the following patch
for cinder driver.
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/202954/

In addition, Sheepdog snapshot is read-only normally and
glance-image cannot be overwritten accidentally.

This patch works without the cinder patch for
Sheepdog driver.

Add support in the multi-tenant store for Swift's
composite authentication support: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/105228

This allows storing users' image data under a separate Swift 'reseller prefix',
eg:

 /v1/SERVICE_123/glance_<image-uuid>

rather than the usual:

 /v1/AUTH_123/glance_<image-uuid>

When configured, users do not have direct access to their image data
via the Swift proxy, and image data are not listed amoung their regular
Swift objects.

Image data can only be accessed via the Glance API.

Blueprint: swift-multi-tenant-store-service-token-support
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance/+spec/swift-multi-tenant-store-service-token-support

Example relevant configuration sections:

Swift's proxy-server.conf (create's the SERVICE reseller prefix and
allows writing to it when the service token provides the 'admin' role):

[filter:keystoneauth]
use = egg:swift#keystoneauth
reseller_prefix = SERVICE_
SERVICE_service_roles = admin
SERVICE_operator_roles = Member

Glance's glance-api.conf:

Some items that need to be treated as individual values are actually
complex data structures. Different formatters need to render those
values in different ways. For human-readable formatters like the table,
we may want to strip punctuation from data structures, for example,
while JSON formatters may need the values to be machine-readable and it
may not be possible to add extra punctuation or whitespace.

This patch adds the ability to all built-in formatters to have values
returned from commands be FormattableColumn instances, which can then be
interrogated for the two different forms of the data (human or machine
readable).

With the fixes for the galera root password:
- python-tripleoclient: https://review.openstack.org/317542
- tripleo-heat-template: https://review.openstack.org/316297

we added the MysqlClustercheckPassword property which sets the password
for the clustercheck user. When a user runs a minor update via ""openstack
overcloud update"" he will get the following error:

    Property error: resources[1].properties: Property MysqlClustercheckPassword not assigned

This happens because the new property does not yet have a set value.
This new property is not set unless we do an ""overcloud deploy"", because
the tripleoclient code generating the passwords does not get invoked
during a minor update.

We want to make sure that it has a value set. It is not used during a
minor update in any case but heat does require it.

Since the process of fixing the galera root password requires a full
overcloud deploy command anyway, it is okay to give the
MysqlClustercheckPassword property a default empty value. Upgrades are
not affected because they do run a a full overcloud deploy command.

we don't want hard enforcement that may result in a raised

There has been an ongoing conflict of concerns with drivers being
proposed to be added to Cinder. Some vendors see this as a marketing
requirement to be able to show their customers they are an ""official""
driver, but they don't have the desire, resources, or ability to fully
commit to providing their driver as open source code and be involved in
the community.

These types of scenarios do not benefit Cinder whatsoever. But at the
same time, they are also a continual source of distraction each release
and have led to some vendors trying different ways to work around
getting code into Cinder while keeping the core of their driver code
closed source, or at least separate and not easily visible to the Cinder
team to review and validate there are no issues.

This proposes a new classification of driver as a compromise for these
drivers that will hopefully minimize the impact on the Cinder community
while giving these vendors some way to show they have working drivers,
even if they can't fully be included in Cinder.

via commit 40ad2899106bc5e5c0cf34c40c9f391e19122a49 (""Deploy
Loadbalancer as a composable role"")

Previosly during delete_subnet in ml2 plugin ip allocation were removed
directly from database. This way ipam driver was unaware of this
deallocation.

Updated workflow to skip removing ip allocations directly from database.
Now ips are deallocated during update_port workflow (L1008).

This resolves issue with dhcp ports left in allocated state on ipam
provides side. Now they are correctly deallocated via update_port.

But this patch has next limitation: currently SLAAC allocations can
not be delete via update_port workflow, so ipam driver is still unaware
of such deallocations.
This part of issue is expected to be fixed as separate patch.

Subnet_in_use check was reworked. Previously it assumed that
auto-allocated ip are already deleted by the time of this check, but
with new workflow auto allocated ips are deleted later (on update_port).
So now this check verifies if there are any user allocated ips instead
of checking all allocations.

In Ubuntu 16.04 the updated kernel that is shipped has conntrack support.
The inclusion of conntrack led to a new firewall driver that removed the
need for hybrid vif plugging. Hybrid vif plugging allowed security groups
to operate properly, but led to significant performance degradation's
when paired with OVS.

Since the inclusion of OVS for the PowerVM driver occurred during the
OpenStack Newton release, it aligned well with the Ubuntu 16.04 release.
As such, the PowerVM driver team did not enable hybrid vif plugging, but
instead focused on standard plugging.

This change set allows an option to turn off the hybrid vif plugging
(for all architectures), but will automatically detect it for PowerVM
and turn it off.  This will enable deployments on newer operating systems
to have higher network I/O performance.

On compute-nodes, Nova creates the bridge with the tap before
the physical is in the bridge. This causes the tap to have the
default 1500 MTU which may be different to what is on the physical.
With this patch the linuxbridge agent ensures that the MTU on the
tap device is the same as what is on the physical device.

This commit introduces the security proxying framework for
VNC.  Which class is being used to do the security proxying
can be set on a per-traffic-type basis by pointing
the appropriate configuration option to an appropriate
subclass.

Currently, only VNC is supported, via the configuration
option 'novncproxy_security_driver'.

The workflow for adding a new VNC security proxy driver is
to subclass the traffic-type-specific security proxy
base classes (e.g. RFBSecurityProxyHelper), and implement
the `choose_security_type` and `security_handshake` methods.

This adds support for using x509/TLS security
between the compute node and websocket proxy when
using websockify to proxy VNC traffic.

In order to use this with x509, an operator would
have to set up client keys and certificates, as
well as CA certificates, and configure libvirt
to pass the appropriate options to QEmu (this
is configured globally for libvirt, not by Nova).
This process is documented on the libvirt
website.

Then, the operator would enable this driver and
set the following options in /etc/nova/nova.conf:

   [console_proxy_tls]
   client_key = /path/to/client/keyfile

This change reworks how we are managing the m1.micro flavor that is used
by OSTF. As part of this change we are moving the creation out of the
general controller configuration and putting it into the task where we
also manage the image installation used by OSTF. As part of this move,
we are also refactoring the haproxy wait configuration for the nova
backends to their own class with tests so it can be more easily reused.

Since Nova doesn't currently provide an API call to indicate whether
its quotas are disabled, we could use a parameter named
'enable_quotas' within 'OPENSTACK_HYPERVISOR_FEATURES' setting for
this purpose. This allows to avoid errors while trying to update
quotas which are disabled on service side. Also make disabled_quotas
collection to be a set instead of a list - this removes duplicate
fields that appear due to some possible quota overlaps between Nova
and Neutron.

Also, since we dropped out python2.6 support fancy set literals and
dict comprehensions can be used.

Haproxy uses two separate maxconn values: the maxconn setting in the

resources, while the maxconn setting in the frontend context controls
if additional connections are accepted on that frontend.

This patch adds a maxconn to the global context equal to the sum of the

1. Help messages and doc strings for 'install plugin' related methods
   were edited for a better understanding what they are intended for.
2. 'Permission denied' and dependencies issues were fixed when calling
   `rally verify installplugin` wirh --system-wide argument.
3. Now Tempest and plugins directory are located in the same directory
   (for-deployment-<deployment-UUID>), which is convenient for changing
   code.

While we are not depend on OpenStack global-requirements, we need to be synced
with it to be sure that Rally compatible with all OpenStack related stuff.

This patch provides new helper script, which checks versions from g-r, correct
license and latest version from pypi.

The usage is simple:

   # sync rally requirements with g-r
   tox -e requirements

   # just format rally requirements
   tox -e requirements -- --format

    # sync rally requirements with g-r & add upper limits for all packages
   tox -e requirements -- --add-uppers

Also, this patch formats Rally requirements in unified form, puts right
licenses to requirements and adds rally licenses in correct way in setup.cfg

fails, functional tests will still fail and catch issues in gate.

define __eq__ for it to work properly [1].There are no implied
relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of x==y
does not imply that x!=y is false. Accordingly, when defining
__eq__(), one should also define __ne__() so that the operators

Before this change if  master node had been upgraded to Fuel of
versions >= 8.0, attempt to re/deploy existing clusters would have failed
as attributes of those clusters would have lack 'deployed_before' field.

Since processing of the flag is temporary solution it should not be
coded in data base migration logic. Thus the change introduces creating
of the attribute with given value if it is not already present.
