Currently all pip install tasks only require the package to be
present. This means that when an environment undergoes a minor
upgrade the package is not upgraded to the same version that
was tested with. This ultimately results in a deployed
environment that does not match the tested environment.

While for the services installed into venvs this is not an
issue, it does affect those which do not use venvs and any
packages which are installed outside of a venv or on top
of a venv.

This patch changes the behaviour to ensure that the install
task will always use the latest available package. In
developer_mode this will mean using the version specified
in upper-constraints, and in an integrated build this will
mean the version which is available in the wheel repo's
folder for the tag.

There are various places where we emit a callback to allow
subscribers to do validation or additional bookkeeping during
the various life-cycle events of objects. However, a subscriber
can encounter a DB Deadlock, StaleDataError or other retriable
error that just needs the transaction to be restarted. In the
rest of the Neutron code these exceptions bubble up to the API
layer where the whole request is restarted. However, the exception
catching for the callbacks in various places was preventing these
errors from being retried because they were lost in conversion.

This patch has the callback manager convert retriable exceptions
into RetryRequest exceptions that will not be caught by handlers
of CallbackError so by default it will bubble up to the API layer
and be retried. 'notify' callers can avoid this behavior by
additionally catching RetryRequest.

This patch introduces a new routable addressing format.  This new
address format not only works with traditional broker-based messaging
backends but can be used to optimally route messages across a mesh
messaging topology.  This new addressing format may be enabled either
via configuration or by message bus identification.

This patch moves all of the AMQP 1.0 addressing logic into a new
Addresser class.  This class is used to map an oslo.messaging Target
address and notification flag into a corresponding AMQP 1.0
message/subscription address based on the addressing mode.  This hides
the addressing details from the rest of the driver.

For backward compatibility with previous releases the Addresser can be
configured to automatically detect a non-routable messaging back end
and fall back to using the legacy addressing scheme.

The intention is to use routable addressing as the only form of
addressing supported by the driver regardless of messaging back end.
However before that can happen the legacy addressing must follow the
standard deprecation process.  Until then legacy addressing will
remain available for backwards compatibility.

Currently all pip install tasks only require the package to be
present. This means that when an environment undergoes a minor
upgrade the package is not upgraded to the same version that
was tested with. This ultimately results in a deployed
environment that does not match the tested environment.

While for the services installed into venvs this is not an

packages which are installed outside of a venv or on top
of a venv.

An Allocation represents a use of some class of resource from a
particular resource provider, by a consumer. They can be created
and destroyed.

It is also possible get a list of all allocations associated with a
particular resource provider.

This also includes: a small correction to functional tests of Inventory
so that its structure (where resource_class is defined) is aligned
with the Allocation tests.

This commit adds a check when rebuilding the authorization context of a
trust-scoped token to make sure that both the trustor and the trustee are in
enabled domains. With this patch the uuid token provider and the fernet token
provider give the same response when caching is disabled. If caching is
enabled, the fernet provider will still consider a trust-scoped token valid
even though the trustor/trustee is in a disabled domain. A subsequent patch
will fix the revocation event to make sure the token is removed from the cache
when a domain is disabled.

have enabled options to be mutated at runtime, now we need to do the
same for logging config. The change to allow this is simple but

get_vif_ports returns ports with INVALID and UNASSIGNED
ofports and get_vif_port_set does not. The main scan_ports
loop uses the latter so any INVALID ofports (i.e. ofport == -1)
will be treated as removed and have their local VLANs reclaimed.
So an INVALID ofport could have the same local VLAN as a new
port that was added after it had been reclaimed.

This was causing an error in the _restore_local_vlan_map function
since it was using get_vif_ports which would cause it to process
INVALID ports as well so it could get two network UUIDs using the
same VLAN.

This fixes it by skipping INVALID and UNASSIGNED ofports in the
vlan restoration so it matches the behavior of scan_ports
(which is responsible for deciding which ports are added/removed
for VLAN allocation).

When fallback occurs due to MessagingException, we silently swallow
details about it and report a generic warning log message, then fall
back to using neutronclient to fetch port details. When troubleshooting
issues with metadata agent, it's often useful to know what triggered the
original fall back to neutronclient.

Let's use LOG.exception instead of LOG.warning to log those details.

When user disables shared snat of router gateway, some of the iptables rules
that floating ip needs will not be added to router. This will cause the

 This patch documents the two approaches that can be
 considered to support the common flow classifier functionality.
 Multiple Neutron Stadium features need flow classifier functionality.
 Instead of each feature creating its own FC API, we should have one
 common FC API that can be used by all the features. Currently
 the features that need FC are: Tap as a service, SFC, QoS, FW, BGP/VPN.
 Common FC APIs should be a superset of FC rules used by existing features.
 The goal is to come up with one consistent way of defining the API and
 classification rules. Through this common FC API, each Neutron feature
 can define its own FC and then associate the FC instance with the feature itself.

 An approach will be chosen based on design comprehensiveness, usage simplicity,
 future extensions, implementation, upgrade, and performance complexities.

This patch moves the auth plugins abstract base class out of core and
into plugins/base.py

This removes dependencies where backend code references code in the
core. The reasoning being that the core should know about the backend
interface, but the backends should not know anything about the core
(separation of concerns). And part of the risk here is a potential for
circular dependencies.

- Refactor only, not a blue-print nor bug-fix.
- Refactored service_definition.py which was a python code file acting
  as a configuration file, into server_resources.yaml.  This allows us
  to modify configuration, instead of code.  It also allows to add
  configuration properties at any level... service, pod, or container if
  necessary in the future.
- Added caching to Pathfinder._find_dir so that we hit disk a lot less.

- Added objects for Service, Pod, and Container to service_resources.py.
  This paves the way in the future to add actions on each of these.  For
  example, we today have a functional _bootstrap_service('mariadb').  In
  the future, we can do 's = Service('mariadb'); s.bootstrap();
  s.verify(); s.kill()'.  We can also add methods to query status
  directly from Kubernetes API.  This code reorg allows us to structure
  this nicely for future additions.

get_vif_ports returns ports with INVALID and UNASSIGNED
ofports and get_vif_port_set does not. The main scan_ports
loop uses the latter so any INVALID ofports (i.e. ofport == -1)
will be treated as removed and have their local VLANs reclaimed.
So an INVALID ofport could have the same local VLAN as a new
port that was added after it had been reclaimed.

This was causing an error in the _restore_local_vlan_map function
since it was using get_vif_ports which would cause it to process
INVALID ports as well so it could get two network UUIDs using the
same VLAN.

This fixes it by skipping INVALID and UNASSIGNED ofports in the
vlan restoration so it matches the behavior of scan_ports
(which is responsible for deciding which ports are added/removed
for VLAN allocation).

This approach was used instead of fetching the latest version number at
build time because that meant a CoreOS update could break our gates at
any given time.

A new CoreOS make target, 'pin_latest', was made available. This target
bumps the ""pinned"" version to the latest. An eventual proposal bot will
call this target to ensure we stay up to date. This also offers the
possibility for downstream operators that want to build the latest
version to call this target before building. This leads to the same
result as fetching directly in the python build script, but with more
flexibility.

This is a second attempt to merge this change, as before it caused
frequent CI failures/timeouts. The expectation is that with CoreOS only
gating on IPA, this would be lower impact and easier to mitigate.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

Replaces some of the nova API calls with updates. The code looks really
complicated (because it is) and the reason is that the notification
processing isn't sequential; unlike the unit test, the vast likelihood
in reality is that many of the notifications for an instance will be
received almost simultaneously. As such the partial updates request the
document from the index, and then check the existing state fields. The
update is submitted with the existing version as a kind of transaction
check. This seems to work ok, and most importantly the create.end event
should always add the actual current state.

Patch also adds support for pause, shutdown and suspend (and their
counterparts) such that there'll be a state change update followed by a
full API update on the .end event.

Unit tests include some examples of boot, delete and power change
events.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

This is a combined port of the following:

In case of ports, it is also added to the API, as a readonly field.
It will be used for any port-specific internal information ironic
needs to store inside the port object. In this change we start using
it to store UUIDs of the cleaning ports that ironic creates, instead
of fiddling with port.extra['vif_port_id'], as extra is intended for
operator use only.

This is an alternative implementation for Ansible deploy driver
proof of concept.

Each action is described by single playbook with roles, which is run whole.
Control of deployment types and cleaning steps is through tags and
auxiliary steps file for cleaning.
The playbooks for actions can be set per-node, as is cleaning steps
file.

Supports whole images and partition images with local boot:
- compressed images are downloaded to RAM and converted to disk device;
- raw images are streamed to disk directly from HTTP;
- config drive partition is currently supported for partition images only.

Cleaning is supported, only one clean step for disks shredding in PoC.

Requires Ansible >= 2.0.1
Neutron is mandatory.

Deploy ramdisk requirements: Python, sshd and used utilities.

Experimental DIB element:
https://github.com/pshchelo/stackdev/tree/master/dib_elements/ironic-ansible

Experimental TinyCore-based ramdisk
https://github.com/pshchelo/irsible

Tested on DevStack with VM.
128 MB RAM is found enough for a VM to deploy a standard qcow2 Cirros image
(download to RAM + convert to disk device) when using TinyCore-based
deploy ramdisk.

TODO:
- make scripts in ""files"" folders proper Ansible modules
- add callback hoooks for better logging during long single playbook run
- document variables available to playbooks

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

necessary, this may be needed for some cases. But for others
it will be perfectly fine to allow the worker to continue handling

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.

When running DevStack script of the Tricircle, during the setup
of Nova_apigw, script tries to add some configuration options to
the Neutron configuration file. However this file doesn't exist
at that time, thus script fails.

2. What is the solution to the problem
Stop modifying the Neutron configuration file during the setup
of Nova_apigw. Instead, we modify that file during the setup
of Neutron server.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
   to realize the solution
No new features. Some lines of scripts are removed.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

This will force pip install to use the upper-constraints.txt specified
version of pip modules. When you don't do this, you are out on the
bleeding edge and become unstable everytime some python library in the
wide world changes in a way that you don't expect.

The releasenotes job has no constraints file, so override the install
command there.

This commit is being proposed on stable/liberty and therefore the
install command includes the clear designation of the branch. This is
because, on branches other than master, we need to be sure to get the
upper-constraints.txt file for that branch.

1. Change cert plugin from snakeoil to simple_certificate

The snakeoil plugin offers more functionality, but requires a little
more setup.  Ultimately, though, we will likely replace this plugin
with the dogtag plugin, if we do not disable the cert functionality
altogether.

For now, as at least one plugin is required, we use the
simple_certificate plugin, which requires no setup.

2. Make sure Barbican packaging is installed before db-sync

CI is currently failing because db-sync does not work, python-pymysql is
installed *after* running db-sync and this is wrong.

This patch makes sure things like this don't happen anymore.

3. Move keystone settings to barbican.conf

The current settings (in barbican-api-paste.ini) were not working
and putting them in barbican.conf is more in line with other projects.

 - Updates the owner of the driver

When extracting translation messages from AngularJS templates,
there is no need to keep whitespaces in the messages as there is
no meaning of repeated whitespaces in HTML.
This will make translation effort much simpler.
More detail is described in the bug report.

This commit trims such whitespaces. Django provides a convenient method
to do the same purpose for 'trimmed' option in Django templates.
This method is reused in this commit as well.

Watcher is part of the OpenStack big-tent and is formally

Whilst it provides a range of default goals and strategies,
the most relevant case is to enable re-balancing of the

into account and live migrating instances as required.

Currently this only builds the Docker images for type source
but binary builds are gracefully ignored.

zaqar-ui was using (by default) an independent release model,
although it was never released. However it would prefer to use
stable branches over a forever compatible-with-all-past-releases
model, so a cycle-following model is better suited for its goals.
Since it was never released before, it is still time to adjust it
before we process newton-2.

Change swift.proxy.server.Application.error_occurred()
to decode message as utf-8 in same way that the
exception_occurred() method was changed in [1].

This prevents a unicode error when logging error responses
in swift.proxy.controllers.base.Controller._make_request()
for paths that have non-ascii characters. Although the unicode
error is currently caught by a surrounding except clause, the
logging and error limiting treatment is different for ascii
vs non-ascii paths. This patch makes them consistent.

Fix the server type reported in _make_request() to be
the correct server type, not always 'Container Server'.

Fix path arg passed to _get_conn_response in
swift.proxy.controllers.obj.BaseObjectController to be req.path
rather than req.

Add unit tests for error_occurred() being called with non-ascii
paths and extend tests for exception_occurred() (see Related-Bug).

charm units will shutdown if it does not receive a response from
a nova-conductor within a short timeout period; this can happen
if the nova-conductor is not yet wired to the messaging bus.

Trigger a remote restart using the existing relation api when
the amqp relation is complete, and nova-conductor services should
be (shortly) up and running.

These tests currently rely on existing objects magically updating with

change refetches objects in preperation for the fix to bug #1479723.
This is closer in behaviour to how we actually use the db objects in
other parts of the codebase.

This is to copy fix of bug 1439869 from Nova to os-brick.

Currently iSCSI volume attachment fails if iscsi_use_multipath is
set to True. This is because the encryptor requests cryptsetup
to create the symlink to the LUKS device with the same name of
the device-mapper multipath device. To avoid the name collision,
this patch adds the 'crypt-' prefix to the symlink.
