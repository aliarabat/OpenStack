Commit I8ae11633962a48de6e8559b85447b8c8c753d705 made a number of the
extensions methods class-level in APIExtensionDescriptor. This patch
updates the code to use them as classmethods rather than creating an
instance of the extension.

We have tests to make sure we raise a 403 Forbidden in the event we
catch an exception from oslo.policy due to InvalidScope. An assertion
in these tests made sure we logged a warning by checking a mock was
called exactly once.

This is going to fail when we start deprecating policies in Stein in
favor of ones that enable system scope checking. Instead of checking
that assertion is called only once, let's just make sure it is called
at least once with the arguments we expect. Otherwise we're going to
catch false positives with the assertion because deprecated policies
are also logged for operators.

This patch heavily depends on the neutron-fwaas WIP patches[1]

Neutron-fwaas has not adopt the service driver model yet. This
leaves networking-odl in implemeting a pseudo/fake agent on
behalf of all the compute nodes. Once neutron-fwaas adopts the
service driver model, networking-odl will move to that.

Pieces that are missing currently:
* hook up to ODL notification and update firewall_group status
* journal records dependency checking
* populate this fwaas pseudo agent to neutron agent DB somehow
* setup.cfg entry
* unit tests of course

live-migrated, a Planned VM is created at the destination.
If the live-migration fails, the Planned VM is not cleaned
up at the destination.

This patch will ensure that rollback_live_migration_at_destination
is being called on live-migration failure for Hyper-V compute nodes,
which will clean up the Planned VM.

Developers run all sorts of different tools within Git repositories,
any of which can leave their own special trashfiles all over the
place. We can't every hope to catalog them all, so better to
recommend developers simply configure a global core.excludesfile to
filter the irrelevant files which tend to get created by their
personal choice of tools.

To this end, remove the long-standing sections for ""Mr Developer""
and ""Editors"" since their mere existence here sends the signal that
we welcome (and have time to review) additions for any old tool
someone ever might happen to try. Also add a comment block
explaining this, for clarity.

We can, and should of course, continue to list files created by the
tools recommended by our workflow (test frameworks called from tox,
documentation and packaging builds, et cetera).

This solves the problem that bootstrap_nodeid, which is set to the
first node in each role via t-h-t, can match potentially more than
one node - e.g in the event that a service is deployed such that it
spans more than one role.

The SERVICE_short_bootstrap_node_name is automatically generated
based on the composable service template service_name, and this
considers all roles where the service is enabled, e.g it should
only evaluate true once regardles off the roles where the service
is enabled.

We're using a hardcoded 15 seconds timeout when canceling WMI jobs.

Some jobs may not be cancelable, some may take longer to stop. For
example, Nova instances may end up in error state after attempting
to delete them as this hardcoded timeout gets exceeded.

That being considered, we're now adding a config option for this,
also increasing the default timeout to 2 minutes.

Ideally, Nova should pass a timeout here. Still, by adding a config
option at the os-win level, it's easier to backport this to older
releases, also providing a default for any kind of WMI job.

In a few places, we're using ""is"" or ""is not"", when comparing
numeric variables.

This is incorrect and will give unexpected results when the types
do not match (for example, if one of the variables is a long int):

There is a race condition when adding a new recordset to a zone
and when central is processing the update_status from a previous
recordset/zone operation. In the subsequent recordset operation,
central fails to update the zone's action/status in DB to UPDATE/PENDING.
It remains as NONE/ACTIVE, and worker error's out.

Each operation retrieves a different copy in memory of the Zone object
(when it calls self.storage.get_zone). As a result this does not update
the obj_changes field for the zone object for the latter operation.
Therefore the DB update doesn't update any values.

update_status should be synchronized as it updates zone DB

Adds check mode support for puppet host tasks.

This works by writing the new puppet host manifest under
/var/lib/tripleo-config/check-mode, and diffing it against the existing
version of the manifest.

Puppet is also run with --noop, so that it only reports on what changes
would have been made.

It also uses the check mode hiera configuration at
/etc/puppet/check-mode/hiera.yaml if it exists so that the updated hiera
data is also accounted for when puppet runs with --noop.

with_dict is replaced by ansible's loop:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_loops.html#with-dict

This migrates tasks using with_dict over to use loop instead.

Additionally, when using loop (or with_dict), the entire loop item is
logged by default. This makes these tasks very verbose since we're
looping over large json/yaml files. Instead, use loop_control and label
ot only log the item key. The entire data structure already exists in
the config-download directory anyway, so there's no need to log the
whole thing to the console.

When two management systems are available openstack/cinder and
SolidFire-API/GUI  a volume can be deleted though either interface. Thus
if a volume is deleted through the SolidFire-interface and then again
through the openstack/cinder interface it was possible to delete another
volume.

The original code made an incorrect assumption on all the possible values returned
from a query to find the target volume. This could lead to deleting a
volume that was not the target of the original delete command from openstack/cinder.

The correction in the module _get_sfvol_by_cinder_vref  validates that the
returned object/volumes-id matchs the requested volume-id with a
comparison of svol['volumeID'] to int(sf_vid)

When we rerun an execution we must create the ""_check_and_complete""
delayed calls for all parent workflows. The problem was that we created
the delayed call only for the rerun execution and its parent.

Recursive rerun was extracted in the separated function. Because we
need to execute some additional operations, for example, create delayed
call for every a rerun execution.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are

When deploying multinode environments with devstack using sample
config files, all nodes were eligible to host a gateway but normally
only one would have external connectivity. This would lead to
some gateways being unreachable.

This patch is setting the 'enable-chassis-as-gw' in the default
sample file and leave it disabled in the compute one. This way,
gateways will be scheduled only on master nodes where external
connectivity is assumed.

To fix for grenade slow discovery of e1000 network devices.

Ironic Inspector grenade job is using e1000 driver since
change: I4ec297281380896ffe9004c4de7117586ded7149

In some cases the e1000 devices has not registered yet,
and thus the dhcp init script does not find any interfaces
to bring up. This causes the grenade job to continue with
no networking, and the job finally fail.

Make the udev settle timout configurable (default 20 sec)
in finalise-tinyipa.sh.

Let's hope 20 seconds is enough. If not we now have more
logs to identify the issue.

Since the switch to stestr in commit 2222dbb47, the tests have taken to

configuration for OS_STDOUT_CAPTURE and OS_STDERR_CAPTURE, which was
previously configured in '.testr.conf'. This is fixed. However, it seems
it's also necessary to explicitly pass the '--suppress-attachments'
option to 'stestr' to properly silence things. This seems to be
necessary because many pbr commands output to stdout by default, while
other projects (nova, etc.) use 'logging'. Use of this option requires
stestr 2.1.0 [1] so we bump the lower-constraint.

As an aside, finding out what caused this output was easier said than
done. I tried stestr, testr and fixtures, before finally finding it in
subunit.

tries to determine the request data type, we need to explicitly
tell Elasticsearch the request body is JSON. Since we use

The release notes said it was okay not to run the nova-consoleauth
service in Rocky, but that's not true because the Rocky code is storing
new console authorization tokens in both the database backend and the
existing nova-consoleauth backend. The use of nova-consoleauth will be
discontinued in Stein (for non-cells v1). We can't remove
nova-consoleauth until we remove cells v1.

In Rocky, we deprecated the nova-consoleauth service but there were
unconditional calls to nova-consoleauth in the compute/api, which
made it impossible to avoid running the nova-consoleauth service.

This adds conditional checks to call nova-consoleauth only if the
[workarounds]enable_consoleauth configuration option is True. The
option defaults to False because the default console token auth TTL
is 10 minutes and only operators who have configured much longer TTL
or otherwise wish to avoid resetting all consoles at upgrade time
need to use the option.

This also updates the /os-console-auth-tokens/{console_token} API to
use nova-consoleauth only if the [workarounds] option is enabled. This
had to be done in the same change because the conditional checks in
the compute/api code caused the /os-console-auth-tokens API functional
tests to fail to find token authorizations in nova-consoleauth.

This patch adds a valid state transition from ERROR to TERMINATING,
which should allow a lease in the ERROR state to at least attempt to
clean itself up upon lease end. If this state transition is not allowed,
leases in the ERROR state effectively will not be cleaned up and their
hosts will stay in the corresponding aggregate instead of being returned

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

Additional argument to be able to customize the ERL command line

Erlang VM. By default we are now passing '+sbwt none' to set the
the erlang scheduler busy wait threshold. This threshold determines how
long schedulers are to busy wait when running out of work before going
to sleep. On most of our deployments where rabbitmq shares a node with
a lot of other services it makes little sense to busy wait when out of
work in order to improve latency as other processes are more likely to
fail to do work due to CPUs being overused by rabbit,

with no other observable impact.

There is a typo in the logic around reconnect_intervl
which makes it skip setting the interval.

Let's fix that by making the code more explicit.
Tested with a custom reconnect interval set via:
ExtraConfig:
  pacemaker_remote_reconnect_interval: 120

And obtained the correct state of the remote resource:
[root@controller-0 ~]# pcs resource show compute-0 |grep reconnect
  Attributes: reconnect_interval=120 server=172.17.1.14

Before the fix there would be no reconnect_interval
attribute.

Previously we were only deploying a master node. This commit adds the
worker and infra service to the deployed node and configures it as an
all-in-one node. In order to do so, we need to disable HAproxy when
deploying in all-in-one as the HAproxy instance Openshift deploys on
the infra node conflicts with the one we normally set up. They both
bind ports 80 and 443.

Also removes the useless ComputeServices parameter that only makes
sense in a multinode environment.

Remove scripts and templates which dealt with Pacemaker and its

should all now be unused.

Many environments had this mapping:

    OS::TripleO::Tasks::ControllerPostConfig: OS::Heat::None
    OS::TripleO::Tasks::ControllerPostPuppetRestart: ../../extraconfig/tasks/post_puppet_pacemaker_restart.yaml

ControllerPostConfig, so if ControllerPostConfig is OS::Heat::None, it
doesn't matter what ControllerPostPuppetRestart is mapped to.

By adding a pre-finalise.d phase that runs outside the chroot, we can
mount outside things into the hierarchy at $TMP_BUILD_DIR/mnt which
are then seen by the in-chroot finalise.d phase.

This adds a scaled back replication implementation
that leaves the bulk of the work up to the driver.
We just provide basic admin API methods to do things
like enable/disable and fail-over.  Set up and
specification of replication targets for a specific
back end are now intended to be part of the cinder.conf
in the driver section itself.

Replication targets are configured via the cinder.conf
file in their associated driver section.  See the devref
doc included in this commit for details on the format.

The next step in configuration is to create a volume-type
with replication info in the extra-specs.
    extra-specs = replication=enable, volume_backend_name=foo

This instructs the driver to utilize replication, default is
up to the driver but would suggest single way rep and in the case
of multiple targets, driver could choose or have a default.

If the back end doesn't report replication=enabled in it's stats
updates the scheduler will fail to place the volume due to invalid
host, or no hosts available.

Vendors can easily modify extra-specs or their own config settings
to modify this behavior, any vendor-unique adaptation can be
provided through the use of scoped keys.  Suggested examples
will be published in docs.

Some minor things after looking at these parts.

The dib-run-parts element doesn't do any of the copying any more, so
these comments are wrong.

This reimplements commit 67a7dc70f2885b7db2a42bc28c25ece0bbeba3e4.
Copytruncate becomes a default for containerized logrotate. The
solution based on signals processing goes away.

As long as key deployment framework components heat-engine and
mistral-engine do not tolerate SIGHUP copytruncate should be used.

There is more openstack services, like neutron-server, nova-scheduler
that cannot handle SIGHUP nicely yet.

Nor can we fall back to that predates the containerization of services
because of the following reasons:

* We cannot and should not use the restart command in postrotate as it
  was before containerization of services. For that a container needs
  to be privileged and granted a docker socket bind-mount, which is a
  total security antipattern and defeats the very purpose of
  containerization. Things may change with future adoption of Podman
  and/or kubelet control plane though. If/when that happens, we might
  consider an option for postrotate to terminate a process with
  SIGTERM, to have the process instantly respawned via its systemd
  unit/kubelet restart policies.

* Individual services' logrotate configs worth nothing, when still
  being handled by a central logrotation container running crond. And
  it needs to remain centralized as individual containers neither do
  run crond nor contain logrotate, nor lightweight containers following
  12-factors apps recommendations should do anything like that. Nor the
  host logrotate/crond can do rotation of logs for containers as we do/
  should not install required packages on the host, but only in
  containers. See also the spec [0] explaining the reasoning better.

All of that makes copytruncate a global choice for logs rotation of
containerized services as we just cannont be sure, if a service foo
*really* does correct processing of SIGHUP. We leave that option for
future implementation in the hope things get fixed eventually. As well
as the aforementioned systemd/kublet option, or the option to provide
stdout only logging [0] and let the logrotate thing go.

To match the previous functionality when not using config-download, the
common deploy step tasks should be skipped for already deployed nodes
when using --skip-deploy-identifier.

This patch adds a task to check if one of the json configuration files
created by the common tasks already exists. If it does, and
--skip-deploy-identifier has caused an empty DeployIdentifier parameter
value, the tasks will be skipped for that node.

* Currently Mistral retries a DB transaction only in case of a DB
  deadlock (often happens on MySql) and a connection error. Both
  make sense to retry because the issue may be temporary. This
  patch also adds sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError to the list of
  retriable exceptions since part of the errors wrapped into this
  exception may also be temporary, such as ""Too many connections""
  error thrown by MySql. Some errors may not make sense to retry
  though (like SQL error) but this shouldn't be a problem because
  most of them will happen during development/testing time and
  will be fixed before going in production and even if it happens
  in a real production the worst thing that will happen is retrying
  a DB transaction up to the maximum configured number of attempts,

This patch is replacing the test_attach_interfaces.py module to use the
RemoteClient from tempest.lib.common instead of tempest.common. Due to
the saner defaults from the new class tests such
""test_reassign_port_between_servers"" is less prone to fail (see related
bug).

Also, this patch intentionally does not attempt to replace every
occurence of tempest.common.utils.linux.remote_client with its
counter-part in tempest.lib because that would require porting
some of the methods that exists in the old class to the new one.
The focus of this patch is to address the problem described in

When backend database is postgresql, ""cinder-manage db purge"" will throw
an exception. The root cause is that ""deleted"" column in table
quality_of_service_specs is of type boolean, but it is compared with an

tinyint(1).

Some logs:
DBAPIError exception wrapped from (psycopg2.ProgrammingError) operator

a redirect, this can not be done if the client automatically follows
redirects. Introduce a parameter that allows consumers to disable the
default behaviour, so that they can see the 301 response instead.

This patchset moves volume attachment tests to non-voting Zuul
gate because those tests have a high rate of spurious failures
that have nothing to do with RBAC testing. This makes it hard
to merge patchsets because they keep failing due to these
spurious failures. Given that Patrole requires high granularity
for its tests, these volume attachment tests have a high
failure rate, given how many voting gates that currently run them.

This will be revisited at a later date. Also the non-voting gate
is in the process of passing again with the following 2 patchsets:

The AIO is useful for demonstrating OpenStack, and for testing
it. The primary services required for demonstration are the
Compute Kit [1] and Horizon. This also serves us well for test
purposes. Rather than having a mix between the AIO and 'Base Kit'
in the jobs, we converge them all to the 'AIO' set and reduce
the set to only include these services.

For the 'metal' jobs we leave horizon out. At this time, horizon
binds to all listening addresses and conflicts with nginx. This
will need to be fixed in a subsequent patch.

We also switch all Xenial jobs to Bionic, and sort the services
in each scenario alphabetically to make them easier to scan when
comparing them. All the commented jobs in the zuul templates/project
are removed - they're just noise which makes reviewing things
confusing.

The OpenSUSE jobs are all set to non-voting for now due to
issues with the mirror. The bionic/ceph jobs are set to non-voting
for now while an issue with RGW is worked out that causes a segfault
when running tempest against it on bionic.

Via I1bfdb6d064f3b10b269dedafd36ca367139fe1df we moved to using
environments/ssl/enable-tls.yaml. The problem is that
the code in roles/overcloud-ssl/library/tls_tht.py assumes that
the parsed yaml file already has the 'resource_registry' key in the
dictionary.

That was true with environments/enable-tls.yaml but is not
true any longer for environments/ssl/enable-tls.yaml.

Since Iaf7386207e5bd8b336759f51e4405fe15114123a in rocky
NodeTLSData is not used anymore, so let's just skip the whole assignment
starting with rocky.
