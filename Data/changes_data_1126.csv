Historically the _sync_power_states periodic task has had the potential
for race conditions and several changes have been made to try and
tighten up this code:

cc5388bbe81aba635fb757e202d860aeed98f3e8
aa1792eb4c1d10e9a192142ce7e20d37871d916a
baabab45e0ae0e9e35872cae77eb04bdb5ee0545
bd8329b34098436d18441a8129f3f20af53c2b91

The handle_lifecycle_events method which gets power state change events
from the compute driver (currently only implemented by the libvirt
driver) and calls _sync_instance_power_state - the same method that the
_sync_power_states periodic task uses, except the periodic task at least
locks when it's running - expands the scope for race problems in the
compute manager so cloud providers should be able to turn it off. It is
also known to have races with reboot where rebooted instances are
automatically shutdown because of delayed lifecycle events that the
instance is stopped even though it's running.

This is consistent with the view that Nova should manage it's own state
and not rely on external events telling it what to do about state
changes. For example, in _sync_instance_power_state, if the Nova
database thinks an instance is stopped but the hypervisor says it's
running, the compute manager issues a force-stop on the instance.

Also, although not documented (at least from what I can find), Nova has
historically held a stance that it does not support out-of-band
discovery and management of instances, so allowing external events to
change state somewhat contradicts that stance and should be at least a
configurable deployment option.

DocImpact: New config option ""handle_virt_lifecycle_events"" in the
           DEFAULT group of nova.conf. By default the value is True
           so there is no upgrade impact or change in functionality.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

This change adds unit tests for the volume_encryption_metadata_get
function. The unit tests provide protection against regressions when
refactoring this code as part of follow-up patches.

Writing the unit tests also exposed a minor issue with the existing
implementation of the volume_encryption_metadata_get function. If the
volume type is not encrypted, then the existing implementation would
raise an exception due to volume_type_encryption_get returning None.
In practice, this issue would not be encountered due to separate
checks to ensure that the volume type is encrypted, but a small
refactoring obviates the need for these checks and allows the
volume_encryption_metadata_get function to be invoked for both
encrypted and ""normal"" volumes.

A separate patch will clean up the unnecessary checks to ensure that
the volume type was encrypted prior to calling this function.

Each test class may now define at class level which credentials
are needed, and they will be allocated automatically by the base
class. To start using this a test class that requires network
resources must implement the setup_credentials method and
define the required resources before super is invoked.

In this patch this only affects the creation of credentials
as defined in the various base classes. Other tests will be
migrated as part of the resource-cleanup bp. Note that this
changes baremetal, identity and orchestration tests to
honour the tenant isolation settings.

In DVR enabled environment, after we associated a floating
IP to a VM, when we restart L3-agent on the same compute
node, the L3-agent will miss to create rtr_fip_subnet for
router_info. The previous floating IP can still work, but
new associated floating IPs to VMs related to the same router
on this L3-agent will fail to configure and not work. This
patch will fix this.

The method create_dvr_fip_interfaces in dvr_router.py will
invoke fip_ns.create_rtr_2_fip_link, and the later one will
create rtr_fip_subnet, consider VMs related to the same router
will share the same rtr_fip_subnet, so processing here should
run only once for those VMs, once rtr_fip_subnet is created.
Current code will check dist_fip_count then decide to invoke
fip_ns.create_rtr_2_fip_link or not.

dist_fip_count should be zero if a router related VMs never
have been associated with any floating IPs before. But if a
router has floating IPs associated to its related VMs, after
it is restared, dist_fip_count will be non-zero, and this is
the point this patch try to fix. And for case rtr_fip_subnet
has been created, both dist_fip_count and is_fisrt will be
false, and fip_ns.create_rtr_2_fip_link will be no more need
to be invoked.

The previous version would fetch neutron data once before repeatedly
checking the Congress table for equivalent data.  This causes a race
condition because the data can change over time.  For example, port
status starts off as BUILD and later changes to ACTIVE.  If the test
first samples neutron and finds that the status is BUILD, the test
will wait until the status becomes BUILD; however, the status may have
already changed to ACTIVE and never change back to BUILD.  This causes
test failures.

Improved error handling in the Python client caused
fatal errors in this test, instead of simply waiting
a bit longer. The error was due to the driver not
always having self.state set for all the relevant tables.

This fix ensures self.state is always set for all the
relevant tables.

The previous version would fetch neutron data once before repeatedly
checking the Congress table for equivalent data.  This causes a race
condition because the data can change over time.  For example, port
status starts off as BUILD and later changes to ACTIVE.  If the test
first samples neutron and finds that the status is BUILD, the test
will wait until the status becomes BUILD; however, the status may have
already changed to ACTIVE and never change back to BUILD.  This causes
test failures.

The warn function was putting content into a side log file which made
it kind of hard to keep an eye on when warnings were actually being
issued. Let's just get this into the main output stream.

The calling of the warn function in git_timed was also incorrect, so
the output would not have been what we expected. This solves that as
well.

This will hopefully give us trackable data about how often we need to
recover from git clone errors.

The existing logic was overly complicated and missed out on those hosts
whose services were disabled.

This is a complete rewrite that makes use of a single aggregate query,
thereby bypassing a lot of the extra logic needed by the old code.

Fixes an issue in objects.AggregateList.get_by_metadata_key() where
filtering by an empty list of hosts will return metadata for all hosts.

Also removes a call to db.aggregate_metadata_get_by_metadata_key() to
avoid the need for special handling due to that method returning
metadata as sets of values instead of strings and also because the same
metadata is already fetched in another method.

The way the query was being performed previously, we would not see any
instances that didn't have a row in instance_extra. This could happen if
an instance hasn't been touched for several releases, or if the data
set is old.

The fix is a simple change to use outerjoin instead of join. This patch
includes a test that ensures that instances with no instance_extra rows
are included in the migration. If we query an instance without such a
row, we create it before doing a save on the instance.

The recent compute rpc api version bump missed out on the security group
related calls that are part of the api.

One possible reason is that both compute and security group client side
rpc api:s share a single target, which is of little value and only cause
mistakes like this.

This change eliminates future problems like this by combining them into

Keystone endpoints are created using python-keystoneclient which uses
Keystone API, which means that keystone service should be already
running. The dependency to run keystone db_sync before *::keystone::auth
is not strong enough, so it is replaced with dependency on keystone
service (which in turn is subscribed to keystone db_sync).

Since nova_floating_range depends on nova::keystone::auth, this will
also ensure that keystone service is running before floating IP ranges
are created with nova-network.

The wait-for-haproxy-nova-backend hack is removed: nova_floating_range
already depends on nova-api class (which declares nova-api service) and
on openstack::ha::nova class which reloads haproxy and declares nova-api
service dependency on keystone haproxy services (which in turn depend on
keystone service and also reload haproxy). With all these dependencies
in place, both keystone and nova services are running and registered
with haproxy before floating IP ranges are created.

Commit bd8329b34098436d18441a8129f3f20af53c2b91 added code to delay
sending a STOPPED lifecycle event for Xen domains to try and ease a race
during reboot where the STOPPED event is sent after the instance is
running again after the reboot operation completed and the
instance.task_state is None. This would trigger handling in the compute
manager which would assume the instance shouldn't be running and shuts
it down.  Since the instance is being shutdown, it's task_state is
'powering-off' when the lifecycle STARTED event comes in shortly after
the STOPPED event and it's ignored in _sync_instance_power_state.

The change here is to remove the Xen restriction because there is a
recreate (on Icehouse and Juno) with virt_type=KVM, so we can assume
this is racy for any configuration of libvirt and the reboot operation
and should add the delay for all virt types. The detailed logs with the
recreate are attached in the bug report.

Test test_delete_router_interface_in_use_by_vpnservice attaches subnet
to router interface and creates vpn service with this router and subnet.
Then it tries to delete the router interface and expects 409(HTTPConflict)
as return code, as this router interface is used by vpn service.

when the test file(test_vpn_db.py) is loaded, it imports vpn_db,
which subscribes follwing vpn callbacks
    vpn_callback, resources.ROUTER_GATEWAY, events.BEFORE_DELETE)
    vpn_callback, resources.ROUTER_INTERFACE, events.BEFORE_DELETE)
for router_interface resource with before_delete event.

When we run this test, _confirm_router_interface_not_in_use function
will be called, which notifies the vpn_callback function.
vpn_callback function raises 409 error as it is using router interface.

This is expected behaviour and test was passing previously.

With the change https://review.openstack.org/#/c/174588 ,
setup_test_registry_instance() is called which creates callbacksManager
(the previous callbacks subscribed by vpn_db.subscribe were overriden as a result)
So now there are no callbacks, call for router delete will be success,
and test will fail as it is not getting expected status.

Now we will again subscribe for the callbacks for the new callbacksManager(
which is created by setup_test_registry_instance()), so that vpn_callback
will called, which raises exception.
As this will be the expected status for the test case, test case will pass.

This patch is also applicable for the test case
test_delete_external_gateway_interface_in_use_by_vpnservice

In newly released ply 3.6 function yacc() of the yacc module no longer
accepts 'None' as the 'tabmodule' keyword parameter and expects a valid
string instead.
Meanwhile, the tabmodule file is not created unless write_tables is set
to True.

This patchset provides such a string and ensures that it is unique.
Omitting the 'tabmodule' parameter at all could possibly do the trick as
well, however that would mean that the parameter would get its default
value - 'parsetab' - which could potentially lead to a minor security
vulnerability if the the system somehow had got a malicious 'parsetab'
module (as yacc attempts to load the generated tables from module
specified by 'tabmodule' before proceeding to grammar generation).
Assigning a random value to this parameter prevents such a situation.

This patch also fixes the ply requirement to <=3.6 to prevent future
gate breakages due to unexpected changes in ply.

This change set provides a mechanism that listens for port provisions
and will dynamically update the Client Network Adapter (CNA) to have the
correct VLAN per the neutron port specification.

This has to be done asynchronously because when nova creates the port,
it doesn't have the VM created yet.  There is a very small delay.  So
the new looping mechanism will wait for a short period of time before
checking.

This should ensure that when a VM is active, it is on the appropriate
VLAN.

Remotable methods in a new TaskLog object need to serialize datatimes
passed as positional args. Right now the serialize_args() decorator only
look at kwargs.

In addition, serialization of datetimes need to use timeutils.strtime()
to match the deserialization code in the db api. Also makes this change
for serialization of kwargs to partially solve a bug with how this
decorator is used in the BandwidthUsage object.

A follow-up patch closes the bug by adding conversion back to datetimes
using existing db api helper method convert_objects_related_datetimes(),
which in turn makes use of timeutils.parse_strtime().

from Openstack to OpenStack actually introduced a bug that means
that users cannot upgrade between those two versions of the code.

An attempt to use this manifest to upgrade from earlier versions
of the code before this change was made is currently not supported
because keystone_service does not support updating it's description.

This commit adds the service description as a class parameter so that
folks using older version of the module can update it to the incorrectly
spelled version.

Pinning a requirement is a very extreme measure, so we should be
really explicit about the kinds of things we allow pins for, and
why. Moving a pinned requirement is also incredibly disruptive, so
this attempts to set a policy about when they should be updated as
well.

All the linter like things are moved to the end of the file and called
out with this policy inline.

The use of the builtin unittest test loader was silently dropping tests
that couldn't be imported.

This change also drops the retargetable path from discovery in the api
path due to a previously-masked configuration problem, and fixes an
invalid import in a functional testing fixture module.

Fullstack tests are also disabled temporarily pending a fix for #1446261.

The devstack unittests source stackrc which means they expect to be able
to determine the HOST_IP of a host. Unfortunately devstack filters out
any IPs that lie in the FIXED_RANGE when doing so. Some of our HPCloud
VMs get host IPs in 10.0.0.0/24 which is the default FIXED_RANGE leading
to invalid test failures when stackrc fails to determine a HOST_IP.

The selected address range was semi chosen by python
random.randint(0,255) and is not special in any other way.

Declaring the openstackclient class from keystone
means that no other puppet class can include the client
libs.

This is not a good idea since the client libraries will
commonly be added to all roles.

This patch ensures that the class is only included and
not declared unless a value other than the default of
ensure=>present needs to be set for the package.

This case was already covered by the existing spec tests
so no further tests were added.

A logical port has an optional parent logical port.  This is for the
case of a container running inside of a VM.  The VM's port is set as a
parent of ports created for containers running in that VM.  Those
container ports also have a 'tag' that is used by OVN to differentiate
traffic to/from the VM itself and each container.

This patch adds the underlying support needed for setting these
fields.  The next patch will use it based on input provided in neutron
requests for creating or updating ports.

The state machine incorrectly models the transition from CLEANFAIL to
to CLEANING state. The spec [1] mentions that management of CLEANING
tasks should be handled in the same fashion as ZAPPING tasks. For
ZAPFAIL:
    Nodes that transition into ZAPFAIL will automatically enter
    maintenance mode, as failure to ZAP a machine usually indicates
    a hardware failure or something else that requires remote hands
    to fix.

Nodes in CLEANFAIL should do a similar thing as ZAPFAIL; they are
put in maintenance mode, but shouldn't be able to transition directly
to CLEANING.

This patch also clarifies the documentation for the transition
CLEANFAIL -> MANAGEABLE.

It however always initializes the process to 'None' in the __init__.
That check is therefore always True.
It should change the condition to check for 'None' value instead.

I also made the 'run' method 'protected' to keep it consistent with the
'pre' and 'post' methods (and also the restore runner which
has the process handling method protected as well).

The swift installation process requires access to the Ubuntu backports
repository to install the liberasurecode1 and liberasurecode-dev packages. In
the hpcloud environments used in OpenStack-CI the backport repository is not
implemented, so we need to ensure that it's there if it hasn't already been
configured. This patch does that as part of the AIO bootstrap process.

Additionally, heat now requires python-saharaclient >= 0.9.0 and we bump here
to allow heat to install successfully.

Note that both issues are causing the gate to fail and need to be addressed
together to get a successful gate.

This fix prevents loading of unsigned ubuntu kernel in UEFI secure
boot environment when image is created using 'iso' element.

'iso' element uses 'linux' and 'initrd' modules of grub2 to load
kernel and initrd respectively. The grub2 implementation of Ubuntu
can load unsigned kernel when these modules are used.

Ubuntu has Grub2 modules 'linuxefi' and 'initrdefi' which exits
boot process if unsigned kernel is used in UEFI secure boot mode.
The 'iso' element should use these modules in grub.cfg to prevent
loading of unsigned kernel when node is booted in the UEFI secure
boot environment.

'linuxefi' and 'initrdefi' works seamlessly when node is booted in
normal UEFI boot mode (non-secure).

Fedora do not have this issue. This fix has been tested in Fedora
environment. It works fine.

ubuntu-signed element would install 'linux-signed-image-generic' that
provides signed kernel that can be used for deploy in UEFI secure boot mode.

Package 'linux-signed-image-generic' ships signed kernel with extension
'.efi.signed' (Ex. '/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-49-generic.efi.signed').

The kernel modules directory for signed kernel and unsigned kernel is same.
It is without 'efi.signed' extension to its name. This is different from normal
practice of directory naming in '/lib/modules' (Ex. For signed kernel
'vmlinuz-3.13.0-49-generic.efi.signed', modules directory is
'/lib/modules/3.13.0-49-generic').
This needed some changes in '/lib/ramdisk-functions' and 'ramdisk' element to
copy kernel modules.

The signed kernel package contains both signed and unsigned kernel. The
unsiged kernel is without extension '.efi.signed' (Ex.
'/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-49-generic'). This required change into
'/lib/img-functions' and 'baremetal' element to pick up signed kernel version
when this element is used.

shouldn't use iterator in this place. Use list of `stack_id`

For py2 we can use .keys(), but .keys() method returns `view`
in py3 and this will lead to the same error as with using
six.iterkeys(). Apply list() to the result given by .keys() to
produce the same behaviour for py2 and py3.
Also refactor tests to make sure that there are no problems
with iterators.

Confirmed this after an IRC conversation (because the pastebin linked in
the comment expired) with Joshua Harlow, who wrote the said comment.

Reasoning behind the comment ""This doesn't seem to get inherited"" is
that many moons ago when creating a qcow2 overlay based on a base image,
apparently, the overlay didn't inherit the 'cluster_size' from the
parent image. It's not the case any more as of today:

  $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 base.qcow2 1G
  Formatting 'base.qcow2', fmt=qcow2 size=1073741824 encryption=off cluster_size=65536 lazy_refcounts=off

  $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b ./base.qcow2 -o backing_fmt=qcow2 overlay1.qcow2
  Formatting 'overlay1.qcow2', fmt=qcow2 size=1073741824 backing_file='./base.qcow2' backing_fmt='qcow2' encryption=off cluster_size=65536 lazy_refcounts=off

The 'cluster_size' of the base and overlay images match.

So, remove the TODO item and the URL to expired pastebin.

PS: Please, let's not add pastebins in code -- they expire. If we're
referring to some content from random websites, at least a concise
summary should be noted in the commit message for permanent archival.

In order to set corrent pinning, we have to use repo's metadata and
that means download repo's Release file, parse it and create pinning
based on it. In that case we'll use all available pinning rules, so
all possible issues will be up to repo maintainer and not because
we're using error prone approach.

Currently, containers' supervisor configs don't have the Fuel version
in the command line. It means that when supervisor tries to start a
container its version retrieved on fly from the '/etc/fuel/version.yaml'.
Since Fuel 6.1, the '/etc/fuel/version.yaml` has to be new, because
otherwise the 'host-upgrade.pp' will use incorrect current version.
Unfortunately, if '/etc/fuel/version.yaml' is new and the puppet
upgrades Docker package, the Docker containers will be stopped and
they won't up again because 'detecting container version on fly' will
give us wrong result (e.g. 6.1 instead of 6.0). So, the only thing
we can do is to set fixed container version in supervisor's configs,
so it won't rely on current state of '/etc/fuel/version.yaml'.

ScalingPolicy will be skipped. This is incorrect. This patch
makes ScalingPolicy check the size limitation based on count
parameter if it is provided.

Adding filter_function to capabilities of PureISCIDriver.  Return
total_volumes as well for use with filter_function.

This will open a way for admins to prevent Cinder from scheduling
volumes on a Pure backend once it has reached the array’s limits. The
primary use case for this is volume limits. An example of a
filter_function that will prevent this issue would be:

filter_function=""capabilities.total_volumes < 500”

This will prevent any issues with Purity versions that are limited to
500 volumes.

Without that filter_function the scheduler will continue to try and
schedule volume creation if space is available instead of selecting
another backend. The end result would be volume creation fails and the
volume is in an error state even though there are backends available
that could have handled it.

DocImpact: This means the PureISCSIDriver will now respect the
filter_function config option. Special Pure specific fields to filter
off of need to be added to the driver config manual.

When the 'context_is_admin' policy is not in the policy.json file
the enforcer simply ends up evaluating whatever is the default
policy configured there.

Therefore this patch:
- Removes the backward compatibility check, since it does not work
- Fails, for safety, check_is_admin if 'context_is_admin' policy is
  not specified
- Fixeds check_is_advsvc in the same way (the backward compatibility
  check never made any sense for this function)
- Fixes unit tests adding appropriate tests for check_is_admin and
  check_is_advsvc

The VMware driver currently identifies a hypervisor as:

  <mo_id>(<cluster name>)

Cluster name is not unique, and mo_id is only unique in the scope of a
single vCenter, so the above can produce duplicate names when managing
clusters with the same name in multiple vCenters. This is especially
likely to occur in lab setups.

This change alters the above format to the following, which uniquely
identifies a cluster globally:

service.py had some code where the child process would catch the
SIGTERM from the parent just so it could exit with 1 status rather
than with an indication that it exited due to SIGTERM. When
shutting down the parent doesn't care in what way the child ended,
only that they're all gone, so this code is unnecessary.

Also, for some reason this caused the child to never exit while
there was an open connection from a client. Probably something
