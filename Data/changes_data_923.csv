This spec is about adding the ability to the OneView drivers of
dynamically allocate OneView resources to Ironic. The current
version of the drivers consider what we call ""pre-allocation"" of
nodes, meaning that when a node is registered in Ironic, even if
it is not in use, this resource is still reserved in OneView.
This change will prevent such situations by allocating OneView
resources only at boot time, allowing both systems to really
share the same pool of hardware.

symptom of that was the code being all squished against the 80 column
line - but honestly the problem is that the code is so deep inside of
conditionals that figuring out what's going on is a bit madenning.

Split it out into another method so that the logic of whether we need to

The network that should be the target of the NAT of a floatingip should
have a subnet that has a gateway_ip. Ignore for a moment the
monumental insanity which is that data model ... that a network can have
one or more subnets, and a network_id is what a port has and is how you
describe what you want to attach to, but even with all of that the
gateway_ip is the cogent property and it's needs to be on all of the
subnets in the network. Just ignore that ... if you can.

Since that is the world we live in, we can discover which network is the
netowrk that has one or more subnets that has the gateway_ip set.

We'll still fail if there are more than one network that has a subnet
with gateway_ip set. But in that case, the config will take care of it.

This is the first patch in a sequence to implement the
blueprint.

The patch implements the database API changes that will be
needed by the new nova-manage quota_usage_refresh command.

A new API is added to refresh the quota usages of the
selected resources.

Another API is added to get the PER_PROJECT_QUOTAS, which
will be needed later in the patch sequence.

Implements blueprint: refresh-quotas-usage

When astara creates allocation config, it has always skipped
service ports (historically VRRP ports), but it currently does not
skip LB ports.  This adds some constants where we can define astara's
service port labels and expand in the future, and takes these into
account when deciding which ports to leave out of allocation config.

Our infrastructure project now has enough measurements in
vertica such that the inner join of the definitiondimensions
table to the measurements table no longer fits in memory --
making the measurements (not statistics) API a land mine.  We receive
the following vertica warning (8389):

'Join inner did not fit in memory [(MonMetrics.DefinitionDimensions x MonMetrics.Measurements)'

If a user loads a dashboard without applying a statistics function, it
can completely lock up monasca-api process and require a service restart.

This change removes the join and replaces with two more efficient
queries, more like the statistics interface.

The previous check for an interface operstate only looked for the
literal ""UP"" in caps, but in my environments I'm seeing operstate
returned as ""up"" in lower-case, which causes the _is_active_nic
check to fail incorrectly.  Example:

[root@overcloud-controller-0 heat-admin]# cat /sys/class/net/eth0/operstate
up

In this environment os-net-config is failing with the exception

Currently Zaqar will support more built-in/reserved
attributes in queue.
We add two important attributes max_messages_post_size
and max_message_ttl.

So it's very useful for users that if they create a queue without
metadata, when they query queue, Zaqar add those two attributes from
config to queue metadata and then return.
That will not be stuck if config is changed and user also can
know what value it is.

Most of the tempest utilities need at least a partially setup
configuration file to work properly. This is because most of them
make api requests in order to perform the expected operations.
This causes a bit of a chicken and egg problem when we rely on
these utilities for configuration purposes since we don't know if
we have enough of a configuration file to run things. This previously
wasn't an issue because all we needed to run was verify-tempest config
and it wasn't in a critical path just for api extension discovery and
it wasn't relied on. But, with the addition of tempest preprovisioned
credentials we rely on a tempest util to create the credentials we
use for running things. We need to ensure the util has as complete of
a config file when it's run to ensure that everything is in the
correct state.

This commit moves the running of all tempest utils and the associated
iniset calls to the end of the configure_tempest function to ensure
that the utils have as complete a config file as possible.
Additionally, it makes all tempest util calls are venv isolated. (which
is mostly future proofing for when things are branched on stable)

To allow translation of release notes, we need to change the srcdir
argument for zanata. The locale files stay the same, just the way they
are referenced is different now.

First, we disable syncing of master for projects with one module
(most projects, exceptions include horizon and keystone) temporarily.

Then, a manual update of resources is done.

And finally syncing is enabled again.

This change disables syncing and lays the ground work for how the setup
will be later:
* stable/mitaka will use old setup.
* master for *all* projects will use same settings, so this unifies
  current django and python projects, independent of number of modules.

This patch fix the dir_path that helps to get the directory of
Mistral resources.

Without this patch, this is what we get when running Tempest:

IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:

This path is correct and Tempest runs successfully.

In a cloud that has multiple private networks and that requires
floating IPs for public access, it's not possible to know which private
network the floating IP should NAT to without the user providing
some configuration. os-client-config added support for expressing
such a thing in 1.17.0, so start consuming that.

Search subnets for gateway_ip to discover NAT dest

The network that should be the target of the NAT of a floatingip should
have a subnet that has a gateway_ip. Ignore for a moment the
monumental insanity which is that data model ... that a network can have
one or more subnets, and a network_id is what a port has and is how you
describe what you want to attach to, but even with all of that the
gateway_ip is the cogent property and it's needs to be on all of the
subnets in the network. Just ignore that ... if you can.

Since that is the world we live in, we can discover which network is the
netowrk that has one or more subnets that has the gateway_ip set.

We'll still fail if there are more than one network that has a subnet
with gateway_ip set. But in that case, the config will take care of it.

Refactor guts of _find_interesting_networks

_find_interesting_networks is very sadly WAY too long and ugly. A
symptom of that was the code being all squished against the 80 column
line - but honestly the problem is that the code is so deep inside of
conditionals that figuring out what's going on is a bit madenning.

Split it out into another method so that the logic of whether we need to
do things can be isolated from the logic of doing things.

Add nat_destination filter to floating IP creation

In Ansible 1.9.x 'quantum_floating_ip' module you have the option
to specify 'internal_network_name'. This allows you to set the name
of the network of the port to associate with the floating ip.

In Ansible 2.x 'os_floating_ip' you can't do that. This change
should bring the 'internal_network_name' option to be supported
for Ansible 2.x version.

Allow passing nat_destination to get_active_server

One of the code paths in which you might want to declare the
nat_destination is if you're calling get_active_server.

Trying to combine len(ports) and nat_network logic led to weird
debugging. Split the two so that we don't try to search for a network to
attach the fip to if there is only one port on the server.

While the rescan_disks method has been moved to diskutils, the FC
volume driver still tries to use it from fc_utils.

Also, the method attempting to retrieve the volume path does not
pass the expected exceptions to the loopingcall.RetryDecorator,
thus no retry being made if the disk can not be found after the
first rescan.

This change fixes those issues.

As we start to review requests to apply the stable:follows-policy
tag to projects, an easy way to know if a project broke stable
branches is if the project version is capped in global-requirements.

This is generally only possible starting with stable/liberty since
that's when we started using upper-constraints and capping in kilo
was by design (defensive rather than reactive).

Take for example Ifa9b07f7c4e93735aec33adb454e920c3c2d7141 which
proposes to cap python-troveclient<2.1.0 in stable/liberty g-r
because a backward incompatible change made to python-troveclient
in 2.1.0 breaks stable/liberty unit tests for trove.

This is a bit odd to think about with respect to stable branch policy,
because it's not actually the stable/liberty branch of
python-troveclient that is the issue, it's trunk python-troveclient
changes breaking stable branches of other projects.

But in this case, the stable maintenance team could use this cap
as justification for not applying the stable:follows-policy tag
to the python-troveclient project since it makes backward incompatible
changes which break stable branches.

SG rule protocol provided is validated against the DB rules'
protocols for both number and name. The filter provided to DB
is modified so that it is queried for records with both the
protocol name and number, instead of exactly the type provided
with the input. The returned DB rule record's protocol field is
validated against the supplied SG protocol field for both name
or number.
This way, user is still allowed to enter protocol name or number
to create a rule, and API compatibility is maintained.

Closes-Bug: #1215181
(cherry picked from commit 913a64cc1175b3bd7efc7abe34895c32bf39a696)

Also squashed the following regression fix:

===

Don't drop 'protocol' from client supplied security_group_rule dict

If protocol was present in the dict, but was None, then it was never
re-instantiated after being popped out of the dict. This later resulted
in KeyError when trying to access the key on the dict.

If some tasks in deployment graph have version less
than 2.0.0 than we fallback to granular deploy
method. This check should be done before cluster
serialization, which take more time.

So let's check if task can be executed with task based
method before serialization.

This patch significantly improves performance.

This patch series adds the ability for a user to specify a tag to be
applied to a network interface or a disk when booting an instance.
This tag is then exposed through the metadata API. For example, a user
boots a VM with two network interfaces. One is connected to a private
network, the other to the public Internet. There is currently no
direct way to tell which interface is which. Specifying tags allows
the user to distinguish between the two interfaces.

This patch puts in the place the final user-visible pieces:
  * In the Nova API, support for tags when booting servers
  * In the metadata API, support for querying device metadata
  * In the compute manager and rpc api, the required plumbing to make the above
    possible

Implements: blueprint virt-device-role-tagging

DHCP port creation is asynchronous with subnet creation.
Therefore there is a time window where, depending on how fast
the DHCP agent honors the request, the DHCP port IP allocation
may or may not be accounted for in the total number of used IP
for the network. To kill the race, do not run dhcp on the
created subnets at all.

OpenStack-CI implements a global pip configuration which configures
the use of the OpenStack pypi and wheel mirrors.

This patch implements a check for a global pip configuration file,
then adds this file to the list of files to be copied into the
container cache so that all containers have the configuration.

While most containers end up with a localised pip configuration
which locks them down to the repo server (which will ignore the
glocal config), this is very useful for the repo server which
does not get locked down.

In the environments/ subdirectory of tripleo-heat-templates, we mostly
use parameter_defaults, but some of the environment files still use
parameters. This can lead to confusing behavior with respect to
parameter priority when passing environment files to deploy/update
commands. Users might expect that subsequent environment files take
priority over preceding ones, but that might not be the case if the
preceding environment files use `parameters`, while the subsequent ones
use `parameter_defaults`.

This commit switches all `parameters:` uses in environments/
subdirectory to `parameter_defaults:`.

When booting an instance with the config paramter
max_concurrent_builds set to 0, a TypeError is logged in the compute
log. This doesn't prevent the instance from booting, but could be
confusing to someone debugging a different issue. This patch fixes
this issue by fixing the method signature of the __exit__ method of
compute utils's UnlimitedSemaphore. UnlimitedSemaphore was bypassed
entirely in unit tests because the default value for
max_concurrent_builds is 10.

When updating a stack with the existing flag, we keep the parameters
from the old template to be used against the new version. Sometimes
parameters will get remove and won't make sense anymore, and keeping
them would break update with a 'Parameter was not defined' error. This
filters out such parameters so that the updates succeed.

The MTU configured in the neutron network object refers to the IP layer
in the tenant network. However, the client will send Ethernet frames
that need to be encapsulated and these frames will be 4 bytes larger.
E.g. if we set the network MTU to 1450 bytes, the client will send
ethernet frames of size 1454 which will be encapsulated to IP packets of
size 1504. So the correct overhead including the inner ethernet header
will be 54 instead of 50.

WIP: Needs tests added.

Tempest test test_manage_with_type_invalid always passes
because if scheduler mistakenly accept the share type and
host combination, manage operation will fail in the backend
and test would assume it failed for the correct reason.

Part of the fix is ensuring share being managed exists, so
status becomes 'available' if scheduler accepts the share.
Since this test, which is originally a negative test, requires
the resource in the backend to exist and be cleaned up, share needs
to properly be managed again to be deleted. This is exactly what
another separate test does. Originally both test cases were merged
in a single tempest test, possibly for this purpose, so this change
addresses the bug by merging them back.

Currently the build process builds all the wheels for all packages
listed in OpenStack's global requirements.

This is a wasteful process as it contains packages needed by all
OpenStack projects, instead of just the projects OpenStack-Ansible
deploys in the integrated build.

This patch removes the wheel build of all global requirements and
switches the repo build process to only building the wheels that
are actually needed.

(SNAT, DNAT, set-mark and metadata), and the DHCP agent

work done by the iptables manager.

It also fixes the iptables test that was not passing the

A simple test was added to the L3 agent to ensure that the
rules have converged during the normal lifecycle tests.

Previously, in the legacy_v2 controller, a ""create"" would pass an empty
list as a default for the injected files to the compute API. This
behavior has changed, and now, if no personality is specified, the
injected_files parameter ends up as None.

An empty list coming from the controller enabled us to inject files
through the hook mechanism. So, having this behavior changed,
breaks the functionality that was available through this, since we
now aren't able to use that parameter effectively.

NOTE(mriedem): The test is slightly different from master because
the stub_out helper didn't exist in stable/liberty.

This patch configures Nova for use with Ironic, noting that
without moving to cells, an openstack-ansible install can support
only one type of hypervisor at a time (i.e. kvm or ironic etc).
Setting the nova_virt_type determines whether Nova is configured
for Ironic. If it is left unset, the default kvm hypervisor
is used.

The nova virtualization types have all been moved into a single
nova_virt_types data structure which is used to define facts
for a specific supported virtualization type. This change is
compatible with older versions of overrides as the virt type
values are used to set host facts which could also be set
using user variables or any other means to predefine a default
value.

This commit does the following:

- adds tempest_log_dir variable so that /var/log/utility is not assumed
- adds oslo.concurrency and pyOpenSSL to tempest_pip_packages as
  tempest fails to run when it's built on the fly in a role's
  functional test

Note that a subsequent change has been made to openstack-ansible to set
tempest_log_dir to /var/log/utility.

Additionally, this role needs to be refactored so we can install
tempest similar to how other roles install their python software, which
would cause us to not have to track tempest dependencies in
tempest_pip_packages.

The os_keystone role previously relied on a memcached deployment to transfer
SSL certificates and keys to all keystone nodes. Many of the openstack-ansible
repositories have refactored this behavior out in place of registering the
certificates and keys as ansible facts and using ansible's copy module to
transfer them to each node in the deployment.

This breaks the dependency of requiring memcached in order to deploy keystone

The register image failure is mainly caused by the lack of fake_image_id,
which is set in sahara_test.conf with a default value.
It used to be uploaded and set by sahara-ci-config, but as public,
which is not supported to be registered in sahara now.
Also if tests are run manually without sahara-ci-config,
default fake_image_id doesn't exist.

Fixtures as follows:
1. Add check of fake_image_id in resource_setup of BaseDataProcessingTest
2. Log a debug message if fake_image_id not exist or is public,
   otherwise return and skip following steps
3. Try to create an image named 'JobExecutionTest-FakeImage'
4. All following tests use id of this new image instead
5. Delete this image after tests in tearDown of BaseDataProcessingTest

In additon, remove the skip of test_job_executions.

The image build and undercloud install output are both sent to log
files to keep the size of console.log manageable.  However, this
also means we can't write logstash queries against failures in
those steps because logstash can only see console.log.  This change
adds a tail of the log file when the logged command fails so we at
least have a chance of capturing the error in console.log.

Also cleans up the log location messages.  This file...this file
where both refer to different files is just confusing.

Also Nova must have read access to images pool in Ceph.
