This patch fixes multiple issues to unblock gate:

1. With new isort releases (5.X.X) pylint started to fail, with error:

     AttributeError: module 'isort' has no attribute 'SortImports'

   This patch pin isort to 4.3.21, the last version before 5.0.0.

2. Original commit had fixes for lower-constraints, dropped in this
   branch, see below

3. Functional job fails, because during tox run the latest released
   neutron is installed and it requires mock to be installed. This
   patch adds mock to functional test requirements. Note: this needs
   to be deleted as soon as new neutron will be released as on
   development branch neutron does not depend on mock anymore.

4. Another fix had to squashed into this patch as functional job
   neutron-vpnaas-functional-sswan fails with missing 'pip' command
   (called from configure_for_vpn_func_testing.sh) without this fix:

   Fix functional gate failure

   Using command pip3 for python3-pip package.

   (cherry picked from commit d4ef9c04ff03840665f5a47a421ae842db551264)

Additional fixes for stable/train:

1. Drop lower-constraints
   They were fixed in ussuri but need additional changes in train, drop
   them completely for this branch as it was done already in many other
   stable branches

2. Add ensure-tox role for functional job
   Job was converted in newer branches but fails in train with
   tox: command not found

3. Drop psutil from functional requirements as done in other branches

4. Use the 'all' tox env instead of 'all-plugin'

5. Move neutron-vpnaas-tempest-libreswan-centos to experimental

While performing retype or migrate on a volume the name exception
occurs due to the check on all backends including the origin.
The retype status exception occurs because the only accepted state

This change just assures to check the name on the target backend

During resize, on the source host, in resize_instance(), the instance.host
and .node is updated to point to the destination host. This indicates to
the source host's resource tracker that the allocation of this instance
does not need to be tracked as an instance but as an outbound migration
instead. However for the source host's resource tracker to do that it,
needs to use the instance.old_flavor. Unfortunately the
instance.old_flavor is only set during finish_resize() on the
destination host. (resize_instance cast to the finish_resize). So it is
possible that a running resize_instance() set the instance.host to point
to the destination and then before the finish_resize could set the
old_flavor an update_available_resources periodic runs on the source
host. This causes that the allocation of this instance is not tracked as
an instance as the instance.host point to the destination but it is not
tracked as a migration either as the instance.old_flavor is not yet set.
So the allocation on the source host is simply dropped by the periodic
job.

When such migration is confirmed the confirm_resize() tries to drop
the same resource allocation again but fails as the pinned CPUs of the
instance already freed.

When such migration is reverted instead, then revert succeeds but the
source host resource allocation will not contain the resource allocation
of the instance until the next update_available_resources periodic runs
and corrects it.

This does not affect resources tracked exclusively in placement (e.g.
VCPU, MEMORY_MB, DISK_GB) but it does affect NUMA related resource that
are still tracked in the resource tracker (e.g. huge pages, pinned
CPUs).

This patch moves the instance.old_flavor setting to the source node to
the same transaction that sets the instance.host to point to the
destination host. Hence solving the race condition.

The goal of [1] is to, in case of failing when removing the quota
reservation, continue the operation. Any expired reservation will
be removed automatically in any driver.

If the DB transaction fails, it should affect only to the reservation
trying to be deleted. This is why this patch isolates the
""remove_reservation"" method and guarantees it is called outside an
active DB session. That guarantees, in case of failure, no other DB
operation will be affected.

This patch also partially reverts [2] but still checks the security
group rule quota when a new security group is created. Instead of
creating and releasing a quota reservation for the security group
rules created, now only the available quota limit is checked before
creating them. That won't prevent another operation to create security
group rules in parallel, exceeding the available quota. However, this
is not even guaranteed with the current quota driver.

This change attempts to reduce the number of Ceph commands required
in the ceph-rbd-pool job by collecting most pool properties in a
single call and by setting only those properties where the current
value differs from the target value.

Calls to manage_pool() are also run in the background in parallel,
so all pools are configured concurrently instead of serially. The
script waits for all of those calls to complete before proceeding
in order to avoid issues related to the script finishing before all
pools are completely configured.

In Kuryr-kubernetes we mainly rely on two services: Neutron for ports
creating and Octavia for load balancers. Sometimes we observe that either
ports or load balancer hangs in some states indefinitely. In such case,
after we timeout, kuryr controller will crash, leaving ambiguous log
message.

In this patch we introduce two new Prometheus metrics - one for Port and
the other for load balancer, which will be updated during such
situation.

To keep strong consistency for Ceph when Ceph nodes are collocated with
controllers, it is necessary to take a backup of the /var/lib/ceph
directory just before doing a recovery, restore the ReaR backup and then
extract the /var/lib/ceph backup over the (old) ceph data that is
outdated. With this simple action, the information lost is almost none.

This change creates two new scripts that are executed by ReaR during
restore that do exactly what is needed, eliminating the need for doing
it by hand.

The goal of [1] is to, in case of failing when removing the quota
reservation, continue the operation. Any expired reservation will
be removed automatically in any driver.

If the DB transaction fails, it should affect only to the reservation
trying to be deleted. This is why this patch isolates the
""remove_reservation"" method and guarantees it is called outside an
active DB session. That guarantees, in case of failure, no other DB
operation will be affected.

This patch also partially reverts [2] but still checks the security
group rule quota when a new security group is created. Instead of
creating and releasing a quota reservation for the security group
rules created, now only the available quota limit is checked before
creating them. That won't prevent another operation to create security
group rules in parallel, exceeding the available quota. However, this
is not even guaranteed with the current quota driver.

Create VFs using udev rules are required for attaching
and removing PF from a VM. On a reboot, when udev rules
trigger VF creation script and when a VF is attached to
vfio-pci driver, some of the VFs on that PF are not
initialized properly, resulting in VF not found issue.
Though it looks like driver issue, this patch avoids
this scenarios by removing the nic-paritioned VF from
the udev rule, as when one of the VF is attached to host,
the PF cannot be used by the VM.

As decided in Neutron meeting, stable branches will drop this
CI job [2].
For stable/rocky and older in Neutron meeting ([3]) the decision was to
make non-voting and faulty jobs (see [4]) dropped.

By default, Ansible injects a variable for every fact, prefixed with
ansible_. This can result in a large number of variables for each host,
which at scale can incur a performance penalty. Ansible provides a
configuration option [0] that can be set to False to prevent this
injection of facts. In this case, facts should be referenced via
ansible_facts.<fact>.

This change updates all references to Ansible facts within Kayobe
from using individual fact variables to using the items in the
ansible_facts dictionary. This allows users to disable fact variable
injection in their Ansible configuration, which may provide some
performance improvement.

This change disables fact variable injection in the ansible
configuration used in CI, to catch any attempts to use the injected
variables.

We've built up a large amount of tables that are no longer used for
anything, given the removal of their users in past releases. We'd like
to remove those, but before we do that we need to drop the models. This
means there are no references to the tables come N+2, at which point we
can remove the tables themselves.

XenAPI virt driver
  Feature removed entirely in Victoria.

  - agent_builds
  - bw_usage_cache
  - console_pools
  - consoles

nova-network
  Feature removed entirely in Ussuri.

  - dns_domains
  - fixed_ips
  - floating_ips
  - networks
  - provider_fw_rules
  - security_group_default_rules

Cells v1
  Feature removed entirely in Train.

  - cells

Volume Snapshots
  Feature removed entirely in Liberty.

  - snapshots

EC2 API
  Feature removed entirely in Mitaka. Note that these tables are *not*
  used by the separate ec2-api project.

  - snapshot_id_mappings
  - volume_id_mappings

In addition, the following tables were moved to the API DB over the
course of a couple of releases, ending roughly around Newton (for the
subset we're removing here), and can also be removed:

- aggregate_hosts
- aggregate_metadata
- aggregates
- instance_group_member
- instance_group_policy
- instance_groups
- instance_type_extra_specs
- instance_type_projects
- instance_types

Finally, there are quota and security group-related models that are no
longer necessary with the removal of nova-network along with a KeyPair
model that has since been moved to the API DB. All of these can be
removed but these require additional cleanup and therefore will be
handled separately.

We're not able to remove them entirely yet, since they are still

be able to understand them. However, we can neuter them, allowing us to
remove the bulk of the code.

The ""ignore_errors"" key forces ansible to ignore failure
of the task, but not syntax errors and many other cases,
often falling under the 'error' umbrella.

One of the ansible-lint experimental rules, registers
the ""ignore_errors"" as a violation, and at this time it is set
to only produce warnings.

Nevertheless, while all of the cases present at this date are
a legitimate use of the ""ignore_errors"" mechanism,
it doesn't have to be the case in the future.

Therefore, selective suppression of the warning should give us
both information about future, problematic, violations of the rule,
and reduce the cluttering of the ansible-lint output.

The latest versions of logstash 7.x do not support using the OSS version
of Elasticsearch, and fail to push logs if an OSS version is used. This
prevents Monasca log API from working correctly.

This change fixes the issue by pinning logstash-oss to 7.9.x, the most
recent available package in the repo that still supports Elasticsearch
OSS.

NOTE: logstash 7.11 introduced the breaking change, however 7.10 is
unavailable in the package repos.

Currently in ""overcloud delete"" we try to delete heat stack,
In patch[1] we added a rescue block for ""Delete heat stack"" task
to not fail even if we are not able to delete a stack to handle
the new ephermal heat stack case.

But user still get an intermidiate keystone exception about heat
endpoints not available[2], afterwards we print ""this might be okay""
based on deployment, but this is a bit hostile for the user .

Also for ephermal heat case, we can speed up the ""overcloud delete""
execution by not trying heat stack delete at all.

With tripleoclient patch[3] adding a new argument `--heat-type`
in ""overcloud delete"" command that will default to `pod` (ephermal
heat) and based on input we will set a var `heat_stack_delete`
that will decide whether to run heat stack delete at all.

Reverting the original ""Delete heat stack"" task prior to [1]
with a conditional when based on `heat_stack_delete` var.

Looks like swift log forwarding is skipped atm. Conditions on
ansible blocks are evaluated per task and once a var is
registered, 'is not defined' check (from block) fails and the tasks
are skipped.

This keeps the tasks same in both services so the duplicates
are excluded in DeployStepsTasks.

Also uses shell command like haproxy to check service status.

context manager, which performs the write.

When multiple clients are all updating the same user reference, it's
more likely they will see an HTTP 500 because of race conditions exiting
the context manager. The HTTP 500 is due to stale data when updating
password expiration for old passwords, which happens when setting a new
password for a user.

This commit attempts to handle that case more gracefully than throwing a
500 by detecting StaleDataErrors from sqlalchemy and retrying.  The
identity sql backend will retry the request for clients that have
stale data change from underneath them.

Conflicts:
      keystone/tests/unit/test_backend_sql.py due to import order
      differences between train and ussuri. Also adjust the expected log
      message since the method path is different compared to older
      releases, which have the driver name in them (e.g., Identity).

Previously, the configuration drive generation code made
use of ``genisoimage``, however ``genisoimage`` is not shipped
universally on all linux distributions, and largely has been
replaced in distributions with other forks, as the tooling has
evolved, forked, and changed over the past quarter century.

We now attempt to utilize multiple different commands, including
the original ``mkisofs`` command and the newer ``xorrisofs``
command when attempting to generate the ISO image, falling back
until one works.

the base pattern in OpenstackSDK.

If labels are not specified on a Job, kubernetes defaults them
to include the labels of their underlying Pod template. Helm 3
injects metadata into all resources [0] including a
`app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm` label. Thus when kubernetes
sees a Job's labels they are no longer empty and thus do not get
defaulted to the underlying Pod template's labels. This is a
problem since Job labels are depended on by
- Armada pre-upgrade delete hooks
- Armada wait logic configurations
- kubernetes-entrypoint dependencies

Thus for each Job template this adds labels matching the
underlying Pod template to retain the same labels that were
present with Helm 2.

The original code overrides the list of monitors with ceph monitors defined
in [global] section of ceph.conf even if monitors are explicitly enlisted
in storage class parameters. This allows to use the only one ceph cluster with
all storage classes.

Patch set fixes this issue by using the monitors from [global] section of
ceph.conf as a 'default' value, only if the 'monitors:' parameter is not explicitly
set in the storage class definition.

Ex.
      storageclass:
        rbd:
          provision_storage_class: true
          provisioner: ""ceph.com/rbd""
          metadata:
            default_storage_class: true
            name: general
          parameters:
            pool: rbd
<...>

In this case is used the monitor list from [global].

      storageclass:
        rbd-custom:
          provision_storage_class: true
          provisioner: ""ceph.com/rbd""
          metadata:
            default_storage_class: true
            name: rbd-custom
          parameters:
            monitors: ceph-mon.cluster.localdomain:6798
            pool: rbd
<...>
In this case the value from storage class will be used.

extends the functionality for the function wait_for_pgs()

The original version of the function can fail if
the Ceph cluster is doing a rebalance or simply
working under high load, being in fact absolutely healthy.
However, the deployment may fail because not all PGs
are in active state at the time of check.
The cluster definitely will do a rebalance if 
the autoscaling gets triggered for some reason.
This is expected Ceph behavior, but can make the
deployment fail.

To prevent these types of false negatives,
the wait_for_pgs() function was significantly
improved and now monitors two different sets of
states - critical and acceptable.

Both lists for critical and acceptable PGs states
are located in values.yaml and could be configured
by a customer.
The wait_while_autoscaling() function was added
to the patch set to exclude possible autoscaling
interference with the PGs status check.

Also the service template joinListWithSeparator was
added to the [helm-toolkit]. This template alows
converting a yaml list into a separated string with
given eliminator. Below is an example of use.

Example of use:
--------------
values: |
  test:
    - foo
    - bar
usage: |
  {{ tuple ""&"" .Values.test | include ""helm-toolkit.utils.joinListWithSeparator"" }}
return: |

This patch adds a few missing configurations in order to make the latest
release of Magnum work with OpenStack Helm.  The `keystone_auth` section
is necessary for the 'communication' across services, the auth_uri
(deperecated) and the www_authenticate_uri should be properly set to the
public endpoint (so that services can talk to Magnum cleanly) and the
regions for the clients should match the one that Magnum is running in
within a multi-region environment to avoid cross-region requests when
they are not requested.

It also fixes magnum-conductor to allow it to rollout on configuration
changes.

The default hook-delete-policy for Helm is before-hook-creation[1]
which corresponds to ""Delete the previous resource before a new hook
is launched (default)"".

This will result in the secret being wiped on every deploy, the solution
in here is to switch it to `hook-failed` which maps to ""Delete the
resource if the hook failed during execution"" -- however, given that
this is a secret, it will never 'fail', keeping that resource untouched.

This updates the ceph-client chart to use the default settings
for the address and port for the ceph-mgr prometheus module. As
multiple ceph-mgr replicas result in an active/standby deployment,
explicitly setting the exporter address to 0.0.0.0 results in
unexpected behavior. This is because by default, the module will
configure all prometheus module exporter's addresses to the
active mgr's hostname, which allows any queries made to standby
ceph-mgrs to be routed to the active ceph-mgr instead, resulting
in expected behavior

This change bumps up the maximum supported Ansible version to 4.x
(ansible-core 2.11.x) and minimum to 2.10. This synchronises Kayobe with
Kolla Ansible (see change I8b9212934dfab3831986e8db55671baee32f4bbd).

Uses of docker_image are updated. We must now provide the source
parameter. When source is build (for molecule), we replace force by
force_source and force_tag and move path and dockerfile under the build
parameter.

Use docker_image_info instead of docker_image_facts.

Handle update of ansible inside kolla-ansible virtualenv and document
how to do it for the kayobe virtualenv.

To gain visibility into how our upgrades affect existing Cinder
volumes, a new testing path is required.
This patch adds it.

Additionally, it refactors the repeated actions and ensures that
we wait for volume deletions as well.

Ansible facts can have a large impact on the performance of the Ansible
control host. This patch introduces some control over which facts are
gathered (kayobe_ansible_setup_gather_subset) and which facts are stored
(kayobe_ansible_setup_filter). By default we do not change the default
values of these arguments to the setup module. The flexibility of these
arguments is limited, but they do provide enough for a large performance
improvement in a typical moderate to large OpenStack cloud.

In particular, the large complex dict fact for each interface has a
large effect, and on an OpenStack controller or hypervisor there may be
many virtual interfaces. We can use the kayobe_ansible_setup_filter
variable to help:

    kayobe_ansible_setup_filter: 'ansible_[!qt]*'

This causes Ansible to collect but not store facts matching that
pattern, which includes the virtual interface facts. Currently we are
not referencing other facts matching the pattern within Kayobe.
Note that including the 'ansible_' prefix causes meta facts module_setup
and gather_subset to be filtered, but this seems to be the only way to
get a good match on the interface facts. To work around this, we use
ansible_facts rather than module_setup to detect whether facts exist in
the cache.

The exact improvement will vary, but has been reported to be as large as
18x on systems with many virtual interfaces.

This change also introduces a new command to gather facts for Kayobe &
Kolla Ansible on demand, 'kayobe overcloud facts gather'. This can be
used to populate a fact cache.

In the fix for bug 1839560 [1][2], soft-deleted compute nodes may be
restored, to ensure we can reuse ironic node UUIDs as compute node
UUIDs. While this seems to largely work, it results in some nasty errors
being generated [3]:

    InvalidRequestError This session is in 'inactive' state, due to the
    SQL transaction being rolled back; no further SQL can be emitted
    within this transaction.

This happens because compute_node_create is decorated with
pick_context_manager_writer, which begins a transaction. While
_compute_node_get_and_update_deleted claims that calling a second
pick_context_manager_writer decorated function will begin a new
subtransaction, this does not appear to be the case.

This change removes pick_context_manager_writer from the
compute_node_create function, and adds a new _compute_node_create
function which ensures the transaction is finished if
_compute_node_get_and_update_deleted is called.

The new unit test added here fails without this change.

This change marks the removal of the final FIXME from the functional
test added in [4].

Trying to copy an object with non-ASCII characters in its name results
in, depending on the pipeline:
- an error code 412 because of a badly urlencoded path
- an error code 500 ""TypeError: Expected a WSGI string""

This commit fixes the problem by calling str_to_wsgi on the object name
after it has been urldecoded. We do not need to call this on the
container name because it is supposed to contain only ASCII characters.

There is a race condition in nova-compute with the ironic virt driver
as nodes get rebalanced. It can lead to compute nodes being removed in
the DB and not repopulated. Ultimately this prevents these nodes from
being scheduled to.

The issue being addressed here is that if a compute node is deleted by a
host which thinks it is an orphan, then the resource provider for that
node might also be deleted. The compute host that owns the node might
not recreate the resource provider if it exists in the provider tree
cache.

This change fixes the issue by clearing resource providers from the
provider tree cache for which a compute node entry does not exist. Then,
when the available resource for the node is updated, the resource
providers are not found in the cache and get recreated in placement.

Bug 1853009 describes a race condition involving multiple nova-compute
services with ironic. As the compute services start up, the hash ring
rebalances, and the compute services have an inconsistent view of which
is responsible for a compute node.

The sequence of actions here is adapted from a real world log [1], where
multiple nova-compute services were started simultaneously. In some
cases mocks are used to simulate race conditions.

There are three main issues with the behaviour:

* host2 deletes the orphan node compute node after host1 has taken
  ownership of it.

* host1 assumes that another compute service will not delete its nodes.
  Once a node is in rt.compute_nodes, it is not removed again unless the
  node is orphaned. This prevents host1 from recreating the compute
  node.

* host1 assumes that another compute service will not delete its
  resource providers. Once an RP is in the provider tree, it is not
  removed.

This functional test documents the current behaviour, with the idea that
it can be updated as this behaviour is fixed.

There is a race condition in nova-compute with the ironic virt driver
as nodes get rebalanced. It can lead to compute nodes being removed in
the DB and not repopulated. Ultimately this prevents these nodes from
being scheduled to.

The issue being addressed here is that if a compute node is deleted by a
host which thinks it is an orphan, then the resource provider for that
node might also be deleted. The compute host that owns the node might
not recreate the resource provider if it exists in the provider tree
cache.

This change fixes the issue by clearing resource providers from the
provider tree cache for which a compute node entry does not exist. Then,
when the available resource for the node is updated, the resource
providers are not found in the cache and get recreated in placement.

of the ObjectStorage role which stores its state in /srv.

This change adds a very small /srv volume which will generally remain
empty.  A documentation change will be proposed which shows how to set
custom growvols values to grow /srv in the rare case that the
ObjectStorage role is used.

Now that images are converted to raw on the undercloud we need to
consider the implications of creating a 40G whole-disk image which is
mostly empty.

The raw image file on the undercloud is sparse, so storage space is
not consumed. However transferring from the undercloud to deploying
nodes will transfer all 40G of mostly zeros, and ironic-python-agent
will also write all those zeros to disk during deployment. This makes
deployment unnecessarily slow and will cause network scalabilty issues
for large overcloud deployments.

This change reduces the size of the physical root partition to 6GB,
and makes the logical volumes big enough for space to not run out
during image building. The growvols utility will be used post-deploy
to grow all of the volumes (not just /var).

The growvols playbook now has the following default to ensure all
partitions are grown to an appropriate size:
/=8GB /tmp=1GB /var/log=10GB /var/log/audit=2GB /home=1GB /var=100%

Currently if a change lands in tripleo-operator-ansible, we need
to wait for tripleo component promotion to get it into upstream
CI.

As our deployment is drived by tripleo-operator-ansible, it increases
the waiting time to get the fixes and delays in reviews.

In order to fix that, we need to add tripleo-operator-ansible under
required packages so that we can pull it from tripleo current repo
and test it on time.
