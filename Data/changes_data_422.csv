When doing pre-flight validation, return a placeholder value from FnGetAtt
instead of None, if the type of the attribute is known from the attribute
schema.

This should allow some errors to be detected earlier. If the types are
mismatched this can be detected before creating any of the resources.

It should also allow some valid templates to pass validation where they
previously would have been rejected (e.g. when passing attributes to YAQL
functions that are not expecting None as an input).

If the iSCSI connection to a device goes down right after we flush it,
or if one of the paths of a multipath device goes down right before we
start disconnecting, the detach will fail even though it should succeed.

We'll see a VolumePathNotRemoved exception listing volumes that had not
disappeared.

This happens because, under those circumstances, it may take up to 30
seconds for the SCSI device to be removed from /dev, but expect it to
disappear in 6 seconds (first check happens, immediately, then another
in 2 seconds, and another in 4 seconds).

Since the device will be removed if we wait a bit more, this patch makes
it so that we wait for up to 30 seconds for the removal.

To ensure we wait as little time as possible, we change the way we wait
for the devices to be removed.  Instead of checking, sleeping for 2 and
then for 4 seconds, and then checking again, we just sleep 500ms between
checks, and we do the DEBUG log every 5 seconds.

In the _get_subnets_from_port method, we call the neutron /subnets API
to list subnets filtered by subnet IDs. We get the subnet IDs by
iterating all of the fixed IPs for the instance and sending the list of
corresponding subnet IDs. The python-neutronclient sends the list of
subnet IDs as a query string in the URI. When an instance has a large
number of interfaces attached, the list of subnet IDs can be too long
for the URI, resulting in a RequestURITooLong error from neutronclient.

This de-dupes the subnet IDs before calling neutron, to handle the case
where an instance has a large number of interfaces attached, but many
of them are on the same subnet.

Developers run all sorts of different tools within Git repositories,
any of which can leave their own special trashfiles all over the
place. We can't every hope to catalog them all, so better to
recommend developers simply configure a global core.excludesfile to
filter the irrelevant files which tend to get created by their
personal choice of tools.

To this end, remove the long-standing sections for ""Mr Developer""
and ""Editors"" since their mere existence here sends the signal that
we welcome (and have time to review) additions for any old tool
someone ever might happen to try. Also add a comment block
explaining this, for clarity.

We can, and should of course, continue to list files created by the
tools recommended by our workflow (test frameworks called from tox,
documentation and packaging builds, et cetera).

Also, make the grenade job non-voting for now because
it would take long to fix it.
1. It needs to be fixed in the base branch (right now
   it's stable/queens) as grenade uses the base branch's
   tempest.conf (thus NETWORK_API_EXTENSIONS) as it is
   for the target branch.
2. Right now stable/queens gate is broken for unrelated reasons

Closes-Bug: #1789323

This commit includes the following unrelated changes to pass
the gate.
----------------------------------------
Disable rally job for now

rally_openstack 1.2.0 doesn't seem compatible with queens.

return the value as a unicode string.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

Until now, the scope_id was handled separately in the storage backend.
Given that the state is not handled by the storage backend anymore, the
scope_id should not be treated differently by the storage backend. This aims
at simplifying cloudkitty's internal architecture.

In order to make the scope available to the whole orchestrator/API context,
a ""scope_key"" option has been added to cloudkitty.conf, and it has been
removed from the extra_args from the Gnocchi and Monasca collectors.

As we can see [[:digit:]] is not expanded so no logs are collected. This
is because the expansion happens by the user but since he does not have

subshell so it gets run with sudo privileges.

In case of a failure in communication between nova and cinder,
an instance can be deleted, but the attached volume is not properly
marked as detached and then cannot be deleted forever. Yes we can
‚Äúcinder reset-state"" the volume and then delete it, but it's a little
rude because reset-state will never check the real state and just
update state in database, this may damage a normal volume by human
mistake and should always use this with caution. This fix added a check
to ""force-delete"" to check if any valid attachements exists and if
none exists, then clean up the attachment information of the volume so
that the subsequent code can delete the volume.

We want to run with python3 always with python2 being the exception.

Update the functional tests to be python3 by default with a
python2 job to check compat.

Remove python3.5 jobs, since that's covered by python3.6 and the
differences between 3.5 and 3.6 are covered by also having 2.7 in the
gate.

Similarly, make the tips jobs python 3.6 only because they are jobs that
aim to ensure interactions between openstacksdk and keystoneauth and
os-client-config and shade are correct at the unit test level. The
individual unit tests should catch actual python 2.7 issues.

Remove cover jobs because we historically haven't cared about the output
and they take up test nodes. In general it's not that big of a deal, but
we tend to be patch-heavy around here, so it feels extravagant to run a
job we don't actually care about the output of.

Split advanced networking services into a job

We're hitting timeouts like crazy- maybe we're just running low on
resources. Split octavia and designate into their own job. Turn
swift off in that job.

Skip sdk layer dns functional tests when designate is not present. We
should refactor these to deal with both cases.

* For httpd processes, use USR1 to gracefully reload

In preparation for adding another conf option that would have needed to
be kwarg'd all the way down the call stack to the .format method, this
patch removes the existing `minimal` and `summarize` kwargs from the
methods in that call stack and instead makes them instance attributes of
generator._OptFormatter, which is now initialized with the whole
ConfigOpts object rather than those individual options.

This is just a refactor. There is no functional change (assuming nobody
is being naughty and consuming the private _OptFormatter class).

Pin rally to 0.12.1

Rally plugin after version 0.12.1 installs the new and latest
rally-openstack, which has higher requirements of packages and is not
constrained by pike's upper-constraints.txt during installation. This
causes problem on stable/pike and older stable branches: keystone
service is not able to start (ContextualVersionConflict, see
screen-keystone.txt)

The patch that introduced the new behaviour:

The _get_connection_info() method attempts to gather debug information
from the connection, and will reach into the amqp channel to get the
local (client's) TCP port number via the 'sock' property.

If _get_connection_info() is called from autoretry's on_error handler
the 'sock' property notices that the transport is not set and attempts
to re-connect.  amqp has deprecated this reconnect behavior, and in
any case the client's socket is irrelevant since the connection may
not be valid at this point.

At the PTG the Docs team and dhellmann decided that openstackdocstheme
was the proper place to keep the modifications required to build
a theme for StarlingX and other OpenStack Foundation-related projects.

This is a minimal set of changes to support a second theme with a couple
of visual changes thrown in to make obvious that the correct theme
is being used. The remainder of the visual work will follow.
Both PNG and SVG versions of the logo are included.

Add an additional jobs to build the docs and PDF with the new theme.

Modify the wording in README.rst and the docs index page regarding
the distinction between openstackdocstheme the module and openstackdocs
and starlingxdocs the themes and their intended uses.

There are a number of hard-coded OpenStack-isms that will eventually
need to be addressed.

As noted in change I9d97b7a904e2b7d15c763e2a067cc5909cc6c9c5,
if we hit errors in an online data migration method, those
errors are logged but masked from the overall result of the
online data migration run. So it's possible to get a 0 exit
code thinking you've done all of the online data migrations
even though one might have never run properly because of a bug.

There is likely no good reason for the blanket try/except in
the _run_migration method; it's been there since the code was
written. This change removes it because if a migration method
has an exception, we should halt the migration operation rather
than log and semi-silently pass. Furthermore, failing with a
stacktrace is likely advantageous since these things shouldn't
fail but if they do, we probably need a stacktrace to help
debug the root issue.

Start adding type hints to make this a little easier to parse and catch

it's mostly just type annotations.

mypy is an experimental optional static type checker for Python that
aims to combine the benefits of dynamic (or ""duck"") typing and static
typing. While still in development, most features are supported and it's
already being used by real world projects like Sphinx. Let's start small
by integrating it into some of the interfaces that nova exposes. We can
further build upon this if it works out.

This change sets up the boilerplate necessary to use mypy in nova. Type
annotations are not included for any module - these will be added
separately.

One thing that's been bothering me is the complexity that has slowly
been creeping in to the AllocationCandidate.get_by_requests() code (and
all the many functions that are called within it to match providers for
a particular request).

A half dozen functions in the resource_provider.py file were accepting
these long lists of parameters -- dicts of requested resource to
amounts, dicts of required and forbidden trait name to ID maps, lists of
lists of aggregate UUIDs, etc.

I wanted to create an object that tied together related request/matching
policy information but didn't place that information in one of the
versioned objects. The versioned objects are supposed to be as close to
plain-old-data structures as possible, and adding fields to them that
control matching logic or that indicate some policy with regards to
grouping of providers just seemed to be wrong coupling.

So, this patch introduces a CandidateSearchContext object. This object
is constructed from a list of RequestGroup objects. Upon construction,
the request groups are inspected and a series of translation maps
created that allow individual components of a request group to be
queried. A CandidateSearchContext.group_search_context() method returns
a specialized RequestGroupSearchContext object that stores state for a
single granular request group.

The reasons I went with new objects, as opposed to modifying the
RequestGroup objects were two-fold. First, and most importantly, the
RequestGroup object is defined in the placement lib module and is
intended for both client and server use. The search context stuff is
only relevant on the server side. Secondly, I wanted to keep the
RequestGroup attribute as just that: stuff about the request for related
resources and traits. The RequestGroupSearchContext contains information
that is relevant to a particular filtering/fitness operation when we
search for particular allocation candidates that meet a particular
request group's constraints.

This allowed me to simplify the function signatures of a half dozen or
so module-level functions to just accept this RequestGroupSearchContext
object instead of the many dictish parameters.

This RequestGroupSearchContext object can be used to store various
pieces of state information as the allocation candidates are selected,
filtered, and merged depending on the group policy of the request
groups.  Information such as the ""anchor providers"" for a particular
resource provider included in a set of allocation request records is an
example of the kind of information that is relevant to a particular
iteration of the allocation candidate merging process but isn't relevant
or useful to return outside of the
AllocationCandidates.get_by_requests() interface. This patch doesn't
remove the AllocationRequest.use_same_provider or
AllocationRequest.anchor_provider_uuid fields but does provide the
groundwork for followup patches to address that.

Make ""reproposals"" more obvious to readers

Specs are often considered a good reference guide for how a feature
works, and warrant some investment to ensure the spec corresponds to the
final implementation.

While we can generally update a spec after the feature is merged to
reflect the final merged reality, things get a little confusing when a
spec has been re-proposed one or more times.

We mitigate this by adding a warning to the top of all specs that have
been later supplanted by a new revision. We add a new file in
'specs/{release}', called 'reproposals' to track these and avoid
grepping every spec during every build. Finally, we add a test to
enforce this idea going forward.

This is a combination of 10 commits that are needed to have successful
check, gate and periodic stable job runs.

Note: All the tempest related fixes are due to the fact that we can't
pin the version of tempest that we are using, and hence need to adjust
things when tempest evolves.

1. Fix sphinx-docs job for stable branch

build-openstack-sphinx-docs jobs fail on stable branches due to the new
pip version 10 introduces some previously Warning as Error: in case of
calling ""pip install"" without any package name, the command fails.
tox_install.sh is called during docs job without any package passed to
pip.

Also some tests still needs networking-odl package to be installed, however
it is removed from the required-projects of networking-bgpvpn, so they
fails now. To fix this, the easiest solution is to add networking-odl
to .zuul.yaml on stable/* branch as required project.

2. Add networking-odl for periodic-stable jobs

periodic-stable jobs fail: networking-odl is required for jobs on queens
and older stable branches. From rocky, there is no tox_install.sh any
more, so this is not needed there.

3. (stestr change removed)

4. use networking-odl from pypi instead of git master

Two reasons:
- no point in tracking master, now that development is done
  on odl bgpvpn v2 driver, which does not sit in n8g-bgpvpn tree
- odl master is sometimes broken [1], which impacts our CI

[1] http://logs.openstack.org/70/470470/2/check/gate-networking-bgpvpn-dsvm-functional-ubuntu-xenial/febf152/console.html#_2017-06-05_12_56_21_302481

5. Speed up tox_install.sh

* When installing git repos into tox venv, there is no need to
  use full clone. Shallow clone like --depth 1 is sufficient.
  It speeds up tox venv creation.
* Fix import check for networking-bagpipe and networking-odl.
  Python module names use underscores instead of hyphens,
  so the current iport check always returns false.
  As a result, installation of these projects are run multiple times.
* Allow to specify GIT_BASE for local testing.
  Previously PIP_LOCATION exists, but the tox_install.sh installs
  four repositories so PIP_LOCATION actually cannot be used.

In my local env, the time to prepare tox env was reduced from 4m52s
to 2m39s for the first run and from 42s to 19s for the second run
or later (after applying the first two points above).

Note(elod.illes): some changes of tox_install.sh didn't seem trivial to
git so it needed some manual intervention...

Closes-Bug: 1716746

6. Change sourcing neutron l2 agent script for devstack

Source the l2 agent script only in case and in place where functions
from this are going to be used.

7. unbreak tempest tests

The initialization of the self.networks variable was missing.

I don't know yet why this wasn't showing up before, possibly
because the tempest test suite was not in CI before (?).

8. tempest: unbreak scenario test

The initialization of the self.subnets variable was missing.

I don't know yet why this wasn't showing up before, possibly
because the tempest test suite was not in CI before (?).

9. tempest: Switch to local copy of tempset/scenario/manager.py

The manager.py file was literally copied from
tempest as of today. [1]

tempest/scenario/manager.py is not a part of tempest stable
interface for plugins. [2]

This was suggested on openstack-dev as a preparation for
the coming refactoring in tempest. [3]

As tempest is branchless, this change needs to be backported
to all relevant stable branches.

[3] http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2017-February/112938.html

10. Register query hooks at BGPVPNPluginDb object creation

This change also modifies the expected exception raised in tempest
while testing a delete of a bgpvpn by a regular tenant :
the Forbidden exception is now raised instead of the NotFound one.

Note(elod.illes): only the exception change is cherry-picked from
this commit, the networking_bgpvpn/neutron/db/bgpvpn_db.py change
is skipped.

Currently, when attaching neutron pre-existing
port to an instance, if the attach failed, it
will also be deleted in Neutron side due to
bad judgement of the who created the port by
reading not up-to-date info_cache.

The workflow starts at:
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/9ed0d6114/nova/network/neutronv2/api.py#L881
ordered_ports and preexisting_port_ids are
the same when attaching a preexisting port
to an instance and it calls
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/9ed0d6114/nova/network/base_api.py#L246
which calls back into the neutronv2 api code
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/9ed0d6114/nova/network/neutronv2/api.py#L1274
and at this point, compute_utils.refresh_info_cache_for_instance(context,
instance) won't have the newly attached port in it(see
debug log: http://paste.openstack.org/show/613232/)
because _build_network_info_model() is going to
process it. The instance obj in memoryt with old
info_cache will be used at rollback process and
causing the miss-judging.

This patch fixed it by updating instance.info_cache
to the new ic after it is created.

The delay_auth_decision option has two main uses:

  1. Allow a service to provide its own auth mechanism, separate from
     auth tokens (like Swift's tempurl middleware).
  2. Allow a service to integrate with multiple auth middlewares which
     may want to use the same X-Auth-Token header.

The first case works fine even when the service has trouble talking to
Keystone -- the client doesn't send an X-Auth-Token header, so we never
even attempt to contact Keystone.

The second case can be problematic, however. The client will provide
some token, and we don't know whether it's valid for Keystone, the other
auth system, or neither. We have to *try* contacting Keystone, but if
that was down we'd previously return a 503 without ever trying the other
auth system. As a result, a Keystone failure results in a total system
failure.

Now, when delay_auth_decision is True and we cannot determine whether a
token is valid or invalid, we'll instead declare the token invalid and
defer the rejection. As a result, Keystone failures only affect Keystone
users, and tokens issued by the other auth system may still be validated
and used.

Currently the overrides set the role test to build horizon master,
rather than to use the defaults in the role. This is not what is
supposed to happen and master's requirements are incompatible with
ocata's upper-constraints, so it fails.

Also, it seems that the tempest tests aren't working for this combo
of tempest and the tempest plugins. Given that ocata is in extended
maintenance, it should be OK to remove the tempest testing and simply
test the convergence.

Fix use of OVS DPDK context by direct use of methods on context
for OVS table values.

For modern OVS versions that require the PCI address of the
DPDK device for type=dpdk ports, use a hash of the PCI address
for the port name rather than the index of the PCI device in
the current list of devices to use; this is idempotent in the
event that the configuration changes and new devices appear
in the list of devices to use for DPDK.

Only set OVS table values if the value has changed; OVS will
try to re-allocate hugepage memory, irrespective as to whether
the table value actually changed.

Switch to using /run/libvirt-vhost-user for libvirt created DPDK
sockets, allowing libvirt to directly create the socket as part
of instance creation; Use systemd-tmpfiles to ensure that the
vhost-user subdirectory is re-created on boot with the correct
permissions.

Scan data-port and dpdk-bond-mappings for PCI devices to use
for DPDK to avoid having to replicate all PCI devices in data-port
configuration when DPDK bonds are in use.

Previously the image virt type was qemu and the compute node virt
type was kvm. This works for deployments prior to rocky but in
rocky this causes the image type filter to return no valid hosts.
An update to charmhelpers has removed the default behaviour of
setting the virt type to 'qemu' by default.

Due to a bug in icehouse updating glance image properties using
the v2 api fails (See Bug #1371559) so for icehouse deploys
get a v1 client.

When detaching a device from a domain we first attempt to remove the
device from both the persistent and live configs before looping to
ensure the device has really been detached from the running live config.

Previously when this failed we logged an error message that suggested
that this was due to issues detaching the device from a transient
domain, however this is not the case as the domain is persistent.

This change simply updates the error and associated comments to only
reference the live config of the domain.

Additionally a DEBUG line claiming that a device has been successfully
detached is now only logged once the device is removed from the live
config, hopefully avoiding any confusion from this line been logged
each time an attempt is made to detach the device.

This patch adds the handling of consumer generation conflict for the
scheduler report client claim_resources function.

Note that almost every instance move operation uses the migration.uuid
to hold the source node allocation while attempting to allocate on the
destination for the instance. The only exception is evacuation as during
evacuation both the source and the destination allocations are held by
the instance.uuid as consumer.

There are three major cases handled regarding consumer generation
conflicts during claim_resources:

* The caller wants to claim resources and assumes that the provided
  consumer is a new consumer. For example scheduler claims during the
  build of a new instance or during the move of an existing
  instance and the source allocation is held by the migration_uuid. In
  this case if Placement returns consumer generation conflict then there
  is a serious inconsistency about that consumer. So this patch
  ensures that the operation is aborted.

* The caller knows that there is allocation on the consumer before
  calling claim and reads the current allocation from Placement. The
  only example of this in the current codebase is forced evacuation. In
  this case the caller provides the consumer_generation to
  claim_resources. If Placement returns consumer generaton conflict then
  the caller aborts the operation.

* The scheduler wants to claim resources for a non-forced evacuation.
  The scheduler does not know that it is an evacuate operation and the
  scheduler only sees allocation candidates. Therefore the scheduler
  uses the same code path as in the first case and calls claim_resources
  without providing consumer generation. In this case the
  claim_resources code needs to read the actual consumer generation
  from Placement. If during this claim Placement returns consumer
  generaton conflict then claim_resource will raise and let the caller
  abort the opertion.

Do not merge: Testing removing of stestr changes.

This is a combination of 10 commits that are needed to have successful
check, gate and periodic stable job runs.

Note: All the tempest related fixes are due to the fact that we can't
pin the version of tempest that we are using, and hence need to adjust
things when tempest evolves.

1. Fix sphinx-docs job for stable branch

build-openstack-sphinx-docs jobs fail on stable branches due to the new
pip version 10 introduces some previously Warning as Error: in case of
calling ""pip install"" without any package name, the command fails.
tox_install.sh is called during docs job without any package passed to
pip.

Also some tests still needs networking-odl package to be installed, however
it is removed from the required-projects of networking-bgpvpn, so they
fails now. To fix this, the easiest solution is to add networking-odl
to .zuul.yaml on stable/* branch as required project.

2. Add networking-odl for periodic-stable jobs

periodic-stable jobs fail: networking-odl is required for jobs on queens
and older stable branches. From rocky, there is no tox_install.sh any
more, so this is not needed there.

3. Fix post gate hook to accommodate for new os-testr

New os-testr uses stestr under the hood, which creates .stestr but not
.testrepository directory in the current dir. Other than that, it
doesn't seem like there is any difference in the format or names of
files generated in the directory.

Co-Authored-By: Ihar Hrachyshka <ihrachys@redhat.com>

This change also wraps up another fix (simultaneous voting test job
breakage) related to a recent change in the neutron repository of
the import statements for ml2 config.

Note(elod.illes): a bit of a modification needed in the hook script as
not every job calls stestr.

4. use networking-odl from pypi instead of git master

Two reasons:
- no point in tracking master, now that development is done
  on odl bgpvpn v2 driver, which does not sit in n8g-bgpvpn tree
- odl master is sometimes broken [1], which impacts our CI

5. Speed up tox_install.sh

* When installing git repos into tox venv, there is no need to
  use full clone. Shallow clone like --depth 1 is sufficient.
  It speeds up tox venv creation.
* Fix import check for networking-bagpipe and networking-odl.
  Python module names use underscores instead of hyphens,
  so the current iport check always returns false.
  As a result, installation of these projects are run multiple times.
* Allow to specify GIT_BASE for local testing.
  Previously PIP_LOCATION exists, but the tox_install.sh installs
  four repositories so PIP_LOCATION actually cannot be used.

In my local env, the time to prepare tox env was reduced from 4m52s
to 2m39s for the first run and from 42s to 19s for the second run
or later (after applying the first two points above).

Note(elod.illes): some changes of tox_install.sh didn't seem trivial to
git so it needed some manual intervention...

6. Change sourcing neutron l2 agent script for devstack

Source the l2 agent script only in case and in place where functions
from this are going to be used.

7. unbreak tempest tests

The initialization of the self.networks variable was missing.

I don't know yet why this wasn't showing up before, possibly
because the tempest test suite was not in CI before (?).

8. tempest: unbreak scenario test

because the tempest test suite was not in CI before (?).

9. tempest: Switch to local copy of tempset/scenario/manager.py

The manager.py file was literally copied from
tempest as of today. [1]

tempest/scenario/manager.py is not a part of tempest stable
interface for plugins. [2]

This was suggested on openstack-dev as a preparation for
the coming refactoring in tempest. [3]

As tempest is branchless, this change needs to be backported
to all relevant stable branches.

10. Register query hooks at BGPVPNPluginDb object creation

This change also modifies the expected exception raised in tempest
while testing a delete of a bgpvpn by a regular tenant :
the Forbidden exception is now raised instead of the NotFound one.

Note(elod.illes): only the exception change is cherry-picked from
this commit, the networking_bgpvpn/neutron/db/bgpvpn_db.py change
is skipped.

When code needs to load a list of all ports that are not router
interfaces, they tend to fetch the port information into memory and then
iterate over the ports, inspecting each port's device_owner.  For large
numbers of ports this is presumably inefficient.  This came up in a
discussion of just such a part in the code [1].

A more efficient solution is to perform this filtering in SQL.  This
change adds an argument to an existing method in the Port object to do
that.

Job neutron-tempest-plugin-dvr-multinode-scenario was the
last job in neutron-tempest-plugin repo defined using
legacy zuulv2 templates.
This commit migrates it to zuulv3 syntax.

It also adds new ansible role ""multi-node-setup"" which
which creates patch ports between Neutron's external
bridge (br-ex) and infra bridge (br-infra). That is necessary
to provide connectivity to floating IPs, which may be
configured on subnode when dvr is used, from each node.

This patch introduces also new playbook
""dvr-multinode-scenario-pre-run"" which is used to be run in
neutron-tempest-plugin-dvr-multinode-scenario job and which
uses ""multi-node-setup"" role to create those patch ports
on each host used in job.

In 0df91a7f799060cd2e9b8a0adac1efacb974bcb3 a comparison
between ``updated_at`` field from services table and update time
from memcache was added if the servergroup_driver is set to be
mc.

This could be problematic if servergroup_driver=mc and
``[DEFAULT]/enable_new_services`` option in /etc/nova/nova.conf
is set to be ``False`` at the same time, as the ``updated_at``
field will always be ``Null`` in services record.

This patch fixes the bug by returning ``updated_time_in_mc`` instead
under the above mentioned scenario.

When a nova-compute service dies that is one of several ironic based
nova-compute services running, a node rebalance occurs to ensure there
is still an active nova-compute service dealing with requests for the
given instance that is running.

Today, when this occurs, we create a new ComputeNode entry. This change
alters that logic to detect the case of the ironic node rebalance and in
that case we re-use the existing ComputeNode entry, simply updating the
host field to match the new host it has been rebalanced onto.

Previously we hit problems with placement when we get a new
ComputeNode.uuid for the same ironic_node.uuid. This reusing of the
existing entry keeps the ComputeNode.uuid the same when the rebalance of
the ComputeNode occurs.

Without keeping the same ComputeNode.uuid placement errors out with a 409
because we attempt to create a ResourceProvider that has the same name
as an existing ResourceProvdier. Had that worked, we would have noticed
the race that occurs after we create the ResourceProvider but before we
add back the existing allocations for existing instances. Keeping the
ComputeNode.uuid the same means we simply look up the existing
ResourceProvider in placement, avoiding all this pain and tears.

Conflicts were small, primarily due to the addition in Pike of the virt
driver's requires_allocation_refresh class attribute. This attribute is
not used in Ocata.

We've patched stackviz to work under python3 properly but we are still
pulling an old tarball for stackviz that was built last year. The legacy
job that built the file at this location seems to have been removed.
Switch to the new dist/ location which appears to be correct based on
tarball file sizes.

Someone that understands stackviz better than me should confirm this new
locations is the correct one.

Release notes are version independent, so remove version/release
values. We've found that projects now require the service package
to be installed in order to build release notes, and this is entirely
due to the current convention of pulling in the version information.

Release notes should not need installation in order to build, so this
unnecessary version setting needs to be removed.

This is needed for new release notes publishing, see
I56909152975f731a9d2c21b2825b972195e48ee8 and the discussion starting
at
http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2017-November/124480.html

Include a fix for tools/tox_install.sh to work with current docs CI job.
Add .stestr.conf from master for py27 jobs.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that

In order to allow the ironic inspector dnsmasq service to
receive packets after the network service is restarted, the
bind-interfaces option should not be set.  Since the
ironic inspector is bound to the br-ctlplane interface,
its not necessary to set this field as this dnsmasq instance
will only service this interface.

From the dnsmasq man page (http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html).
-z, --bind-interfaces
On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address,
even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then
discards requests that it shouldn't reply to. This has the
advantage of working even when interfaces come and go and
change address. This option forces dnsmasq to really bind only
the interfaces it is listening on. About the only time when
this is useful is when running another nameserver (or another
instance of dnsmasq) on the same machine. Setting this option
also enables multiple instances of dnsmasq which provide DHCP
service to run in the same machine.

We do run another dnsmasq instance for neutron but that is bound to
the tap interface in the namespace.

This addresses a review comment from commit
68011c40ae2ab0900674408a88f62a60a802fef7 where
the new attach kwarg was only added to the neutron
API implementation of the allocate_for_instance() method.
This change adds the attach kwarg to the base API and nova-net
method definitions for that method also.

Update the keystone authtoken template section to explicitly
specify v3 API when it is in use. This prevents errors that
result in ""Could not find versioned identity endpoints when
attempting to authenticate"".

Along with this change we remove the tests that verify the
keystone_authtoken section as it's generally agreed that
functional testing should catch issues with this config.
Also update requirements to fix pyyaml dep of charm-tools.

Finally get glance v1 client for icehouse. Previously the
image virt type was qemu and the compute node virt type was
kvm. This works for deployments prior to rocky but in rocky
this causes the image type filter to return no valid hosts.
An update to charmhelpers has removed the default behaviour
of setting the virt type to 'qemu' by default. Due to a bug
in icehouse updating glance image properties using the v2 api
fails (See Bug #1371559) so for icehouse deploys get a v1
client.

The CLI commands running Ansible can crash if we send too much
single-line log output their way. This was happening on upgrades, when
we run Ansible with verbosity level 1.

The fix is twofold:

* If ceph-ansible finishes successfully, we don't print the
  ceph-ansible output into the main log.

* If ceph-ansible fails, we do print the output, but we print it
  line-by-line, which should give us much better readability than
  before, and we shouldn't break the limits of the Mistral-Zaqar-CLI
  message passing.

There has been some drift between the neutron grafana dashboard
configuration and what jobs are actually being run.  This fixes a number
of issues:

1.) Adds the following jobs that were missing:
        - openstack-tox-pep8
        - openstack-tox-py36
        - tempest-full-py3
        - build-openstack-releasenotes (Check queue only)
        - openstack-tox-docs

2.) Renames the job ""neutron-tempest-multinode-full"" to
""tempest-multinode-full"" to reflect how it is now named.

3.) Remove these jobs that no longer exist or are being removed:
        - legacy-tempest-dsvm-py35
        - neutron-fullstack-python35

Also, in Grafana there is no line for the tempest-slow job, despite the
fact that it is defined here and it is clearly running in the gate.  So
I change it's position slightly to try to get it to populate.

The network rules used to be too broad and could result in conflict when
address space is more restricted. This change updates the network rule
set such that it will not only add address to a macvlan interface using

only. This limits the macvlan network scope to ensure we're not creating
conflicts while also not breaking inter host connectivity.

This patch changes the implementation to ensure that the shade module

is not used for the common path of the venv, because Ansible at this

to always pass. Rather than wasting gate resources for every patch, just
remove the job from the zuul pipelines for now.

It can still be run locally by calling `tox -e compliance`, so new
driver developers, and probably driver reviewers, should still run this
to make sure there is nothing missing, but that is unlikely if they
follow driver conventions.

Currently, if a placeholder vertex is created and the real vertex
already exists in the graph, the placeholder vertex is ignored.
With this change, new properties that are part of the placeholder
vertex will be added to the existing real vertex.

This fix is similar to the one done in Queens:

This spec proposes to add the framework for mechanism drivers
to report errors, when a backend operation fails and give the

on failures alarms can be generated.

The idea is to add basic framework in neutron which will utilized
by mechanism drivers for implemetation of reporting faults and connection
errors with the backend.

This issue affects the neutron OVS agent, when using the Hyper-V
security groups driver.

In quite a few situations, OVS ports may be leaked. This becomes
more troublesome as the OVS agent will try to update rules for
Hyper-V switch ports that do not exist anymore and fail.

Note that the agent handles multiple ports at a time. If one of
them is a leaked port, the others won't get processed.

The security groups driver may just ignore missing ports.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

Require projects to explicitly set the 'universal' flag in the 'wheel'
section, without requiring them to turn it on. This ensures they are
explicitly choosing the wheel format rather than relying on the
default (which will now only give them wheels that work for python 3).

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are

As part of the Denver PTG [1] we decided networking related projects
that are ""current"" and want to receive neutron-lib consumption patches
on an on-going basis should indicate such with a well defined comment
in their requirements.txt. This allows us to easily find the list of
project to receive neutron-lib consumption patches [2] by searching for
the string.

In addition, projects opting-in for these patches are also attesting
they will stay up to date with TC and infra initiatives to ensure
consumption patches can flow freely.

This patch adds the ""neutron-lib-current"" string to requirements.txt
opting in for neutron-lib consumption patches.

Metadata server is important in some deployments and VMs need a way to
reach it. Normally, neutron routers include a static route to the
metadata server and things work, however, when using external L3 plugins
(e.g. ODL) that static route might not be there by default and thus VMs
don't have a way to contact the metadata server. For these cases, there
is an alternative in which the DHCP server pushes the route to the
instances through the 121 message defined in the DHCP standard. To use
this alternative in dnsmasq, we need force_metadata = True in its config

This issue affects the neutron OVS agent, when using the Hyper-V
security groups driver.

In quite a few situations, OVS ports may be leaked. This becomes
more troublesome as the OVS agent will try to update rules for
Hyper-V switch ports that do not exist anymore and fail.

Note that the agent handles multiple ports at a time. If one of
them is a leaked port, the others won't get processed.

The security groups driver may just ignore missing ports.

We need a way to retrieve VM nic names. This will allow the Nova

on events.

It's safer to query Hyper-V directly rather than relying on Nova's port

We're using a hardcoded 15 seconds timeout when canceling WMI jobs.

Some jobs may not be cancelable, some may take longer to stop. For
example, Nova instances may end up in error state after attempting
to delete them as this hardcoded timeout gets exceeded.

That being considered, we're now adding a config option for this,
also increasing the default timeout to 2 minutes.

Ideally, Nova should pass a timeout here. Still, by adding a config
option at the os-win level, it's easier to backport this to older
releases, also providing a default for any kind of WMI job.

This change will allow enabling metrics for individual virtual disks.

Note that Hyper-V does not support collecting metrics for passthrough
disks at the moment.

At the moment, port metrics are not enabled. The reason is that we're
using the wrong switch port WMI class.

This issue went more or less unnoticed, especially due to the fact that
we're currently ignoring the according WMI method return code.

This change ensures that port metrics are properly enabled and that an
exception will be raised when failing to do so.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

In https://review.openstack.org/607636 the docs publishing was removed
for the repo openstack-ansible-os_monasca instead of the intended target
of openstack-ansible-os_monasca-agent. This was for the purpose of making
https://review.openstack.org/597006 pass.

Given that the agent repo doesn't have ay meaningful docs at this time,
removing the docs publishing is a suitable solution to progress the python3
goal. However, we'd like to restore the publishing for the repo which had
docs publishing removed by mistake.

Adds the following tags to relevant tasks in deploy-steps-tasks.yaml
that are common to all roles:

- host_config
- container_config
- container_config_tasks
- container_config_scripts
- container_startup_configs

The tags are tool agnostic, so hopefully they won't have to be updated
over time. They allow users to run only specific parts of the common
tasks.
