This is a bunch of work I did to separate out the initial state
from the state created during create()

We have a chicken and egg problem with the get-value calls; some of
them want values that are known after we've parsed all the
configuration (e.g. rootfs mount & file system type) ... logically we
could grab them from the state.  However, since state generation is
wrapped up with the actual create() calls, it's too late.

In theory, we could separate out initial state generation, from the
config file(s), and then do the create as a totally separate call

This has a few unresolved issues.  For example, we call ""init"" before
finding the size of the disk with ""du"", then we put the new size value
in and call ""create""; which re-reads this.

So quite a lot of refactoring has to be done to get this idea to work.
I'm just putting this here as a record of how to get started if we
need this...

This change provides a small additional wsgi application to download a
tarball of logs for a single test run and related test-cases.

The idea is for a modified URL such as

  http://logs.openstack.org/download/26/118226/1/gate/gate-grenade-dsvm/fb63ac0/

to initiate a download of a file called
118226_1_gate-grenade-dsvm_fb63ac0.tar.gz which includes a copy of all
logs for the test.

There are many way to skin this cat.  To explain some of the choices

 - The logs are compressed to a temporary file which is streamed back
   via wsgi.  This allows us to set the content-length correctly so
   you get what looks like a normal download, and wsgi streams the
   large file efficiently.

 - log packages are around 7MiB from my testing.  This is big but not
   ridiculous.

 - The risk I can see here is if a unfriendly spider decided to
   request every download it possibly could.  In this case, the script
   would start returning 500 errors when it could not create the
   archive.  Due to the existing way we uncompress files for sending,
   a recursive wget (ignoring robots.txt) would be much harder on the
   server than this would be and that doesn't seem to be a problem at
   the moment (people probably do this now to get access to all the
   logs quickly).  We could partition it to use a separate temp space
   if there is a problem.

 - Probably the best alternative is ZipStream [1].  Several issues:
   the pypi version seems to come from a forked source [2], it's a
   .zip, which isn't super-unixy, we don't know the content-length so
   we get no progress.  Given this and the size of the log packages, I
   don't think it this is a better approach for now.

 - The log link can be provided in the readme stuff that gets
   displayed with the logs when this is active

This patch allows the external_post_deploy_tasks to run at every step.
Before, the ansible tasks were only executed at the very end of the
deployment, but this interface can be useful to be also run after the
containers are deployed for each step.

This can be done by running external_post_deploy_tasks at every step.

Note 1: for the existing tasks, force the step to be 5 as it used to be
run after the step 5 (nova-az and nova-compute). The result will be the
same.

Note 2: ""Server Post Deployments"" task will be executed *after* the
external_post_deploy_tasks of step 5 (instead of before); but it
shouldn't change anything for the deployment.

Note 3: It's using a new way of running tasks where it only include the
tasks if they exist for that role AND for the step; so we don't waste
time including skipped tasks.

After this patch, this interface will be used to create the keystone
resources (endpoints, users, etc) with Ansible at the end of the step 3,
once the Keystone container is up.

lead the config generator to double quote keys in the rendered data. This
change modifies the override data to make it use a jinja data structure

* Insight about a node, such as a MAC address, or baremetal node
  UUID.
* Insight into the state of the node, such as the access provided

In middle of Queens and Rocky release we introduced option to

If the environment went through FFWD or was deployed before this
option got backported we need to update the roles_data.

By default we have update_serial either unset at all for OSP13 and OSP14 or
we have it set where Pacemaker enabled nodes, CephOSD nodes and Networkers
have it set to 1. This is mostly defensive precaution and we do allow running
in parallel for CephOSD and Networkers for production systems that did enough
testing on preprod or can take small outage. We should also parallelize it in
CI as we just waste time here.

It's recommand to use this way. With tox is not really necessary to do

Previously we ran role by role which is not necessary and not
intended way of production update. In case of proper testing on
preprod customers should run update as fast as possible which
means leveraging ability to run all roles at once and even all
nodes of selected roles at once. With this patch the Pacemaker
enabled roles will still update in serial but the roles will be
done in parallel. In case of 3 controller 3 database 3 messaging
setup it will look roughly like this:

Update of controller[0] database[0] messaging[0]
Update of controller[0] database[1] messaging[1]
Update of controller[1] database[2] messaging[2]
Update of controller[2]

This is due to not blocking between roles and each role taking
different amount of time to apply the update. At any moment the
pacemaker quorum is not broken.

Train, Stein & Rocky only

Zuul seems to have started setting ansible_python_interpreter to python3
on Ubuntu, which breaks our installation of kolla-ansible on Train and
earlier stable branches.

This change sets ansible_python_interpreter explicitly to python2. We
use host-vars rather than vars because zuul sets a host-var for
ansible_python_interpreter=auto, which overrides vars.

Due to old row format pre-upgrade some current migrations
may fail to apply.
In Train this affects only Ubuntu.
This patch runs a script to change all row formats to DYNAMIC
which is the default in recent MariaDB releases.

This patch incorporates the following change to pass CI:

CI: Set zuul's ansible_python_interpreter to python2

Train, Stein & Rocky only

Zuul seems to have started setting ansible_python_interpreter to python3
on Ubuntu, which breaks our installation of kolla-ansible on Train and
earlier stable branches.

This change sets ansible_python_interpreter explicitly to python2. We
use host-vars rather than vars because zuul sets a host-var for
ansible_python_interpreter=auto, which overrides vars.

It is installed, but not used. This can be seen in the Mistral logs
which have minimal output (other than that of the workbooks being
loaded).

Th other TripleO job also covers this case and then uses Mistral. This

making hard to debug plugin failures.

For understanding what is failing in devstack plugin xtraces are
required. Therefore this change is intended to leave xtrace options as
set by DevStack, that means enabled.

xtraces should be disabled only locally by stable functions that are
called too many times and filling log files of too verbose outputs.

When clouds have a large number of hosts, the default size of the ARP
cache is too small. The cache can overflow, which means that the system
has no way to reach some IP addresses.

Increasing threshold limits addresses the situation, in a reasonably
safe way (the maximum impact is 5MB or so of additional RAM used).

Train, Stein & Rocky only

Zuul seems to have started setting ansible_python_interpreter to python3
on Ubuntu, which breaks our installation of kolla-ansible on Train and
earlier stable branches.

This change sets ansible_python_interpreter explicitly to python2. We
use host-vars rather than vars because zuul sets a host-var for
ansible_python_interpreter=auto, which overrides vars.

Ie54fca066f33 added logic to libvirt/designer.py for enabling iommu
for certain devices where virtio is used.  This is required for AMD
SEV[0].  However it missed two cases.

Firstly, a SCSI controller can have the model as 'virtio-scsi', e.g.:

    <controller type='scsi' index='0' model='virtio-scsi'>

As with other virtio devices, here a child element needs to be added
to the config when SEV is enabled:

    <driver iommu=""on"" />

We do not need to cover the case of a controller with type
'virtio-serial' now, since even though it is supported by libvirt, it
is not currently used anywhere in Nova.

Secondly, a video device can be virtio, e.g. when vgpus are in use:

    <video>
        <model type='virtio'/>
    </video>

Also take this opportunity to clarify the corresponding documentation
around disk bus options.

In order to use AMD SEV, devices that use virtio should also use
iommu driver. The problem is to understand that a device uses virtio,
because there are many attributes and values that can indicate it.
For example, it can be `model='virtio'` for rng and
`<target bus='virtio'/>` for disk.

Add new property for devices `uses_virtio`, that will indicate that a
device in its current configuration is a virtio device, and implement it
for known devices.

The patch does not change how resulting libvirt XMLs look and does not
fix user-visible bugs. This refactoring is required for further work on
AMD SEV related patches.

The changes to memballoon-related tests were required because the tests
were using fake values that does are not possible in real life and that
were preventing tests of the new method. The tests now use the value
that nova currently uses to generate libvirt xml.

Bug #1820007 documents failures to find /dev/disk/by-id/ symlinks
associated with encrypted volumes both in real world and CI
environments. These failures appear to be due to udev on these slow or
overloaded hosts failing to populate the required /dev/disk/by-id/
symlinks in time after the iSCSI volume has been connected.

This change seeks to avoid such failures by simply decorating
_get_device_link with the @utils.retry to hopefully allow udev time to
create the required symlinks under /dev/disk/by-id/.

PrettyTable is no longer maintained and the last release was in 2013.
There are starting to be deprecation warnings emitted with newer Python
releases.

Various attempts to revive a fork haven't gained much traction. A common
recommendation is to move away from PrettyTable to tabulate. This
switches our usage to a close equivalent using that library instead.

I9e636b2d420497f7bf65912fddf7cba72d350a9e is problematic if operators
use octavia::nova and octavia::controller together; so we will revert
the patch in puppet-octavia and update the hieradata here so there is no

Introduces two new parameters to configure the archive deleted

1) NovaCronArchiveDeleteAllCells
To make sure deleted instances get archived also from the cell0

in case of a multi cell deployment.

2) NovaCronArchiveDeleteRowsAge
--before is required to prevent the orphaning of libvirt guests
if/when nova-compute is down when a db archive cron job fires.

This change also modifies
1) the default from 100 to 1000 for NovaCronArchiveDeleteRowsMaxRows
to match the default from the nova-manage command instead the default
of 100 from the puppet-nova parameter.

2) changes the default for NovaCronPurgeShadowTablesAllCells from
false to true also the nova-manage db purge command needs to run
for all cells instead of only the default cell.

This patch moves _update_pci_request_spec_with_allocated_interface_name
from the ComputeManager to nova.compute.utils as a later patch needs to
call it from outside of the ComputeManager.

This patch also changes the exception types raised from
update_pci_request_spec_with_allocated_interface_name as raising
BuildAbortException from a util method does not make too much
sense. This means that some of the callers also needed to be adjusted to
handle the new exception types.

In the _do_rebuild_instance_with_claim code path the exception type is
not translated back to BuildAbortException as the old and the new
exceptions are both handled by the except Exception branch in
rebuild_instance [1].

It might happen the /var/log/journal directory doesn't exist on a host,
especially if this host is a VM (the image creation usually involves
deep cleaning of the logs).

This absence might lead to log loss with the default journald
configuration, which uses the ""auto"" Storage.
This ""auto"" means that:
- if /var/log/journal exists, journald will use it, and it will be
persistent
- if /var/log/journal doesn't exist, journald will use a volatile
location, /run/log/journal, which is dropped upon system reboot

Since logs are important, and ""old"" logs might be useful after a reboot,
it's better to ensure we have persistent storage for journald.

Odd cases about scheduling occasionally appear in production
cluster, e.g:
* some hosts always fail to pass scheduling filters.
* scheduler prefers some hosts(A) to others(B), and thus
  leading to resource imbalance.
For now, the *nova.filters* only displays detailed informarion
when no suitable hosts found. If suitable hosts are found, and
the cloud administrator wants to figure out the root cause of
some other host(s) failing to be chosed, then no logs will help.
And the *nova.weights* does not provide details about how various
factors help one host surpass another in weighting, and a common
user case is that cloud administrator needs to know more details
to do performance tuning to fully utilize cluster resources.

This patch helps to make scheduling transparent, and more friendly
to cloud administrators.

And fix releated unit test cases.

This adds the finish_revert_snapshot_based_resize_at_source() method
to the compute service. This completes the cross-cell resize revert
on the source host by updating port bindings, re-connecting volumes
and spawning the guest and waiting for the network-vif-plugged
event from neutron.

If the resize started with a stopped instance, the revert ensures
the guest is powered off when it is spawned.

The instance record is updated with the old_flavor information,
allocations are reverted in placement, and the migration status in
the source cell database is updated to ""reverted"".

Notifications are not sent from this method like in the
finish_revert_resize() method because those will be sent from
conductor.

Note that this implementation tries to be a bit more graceful
about error handling than the old same-cell finish_revert_resize
method since there are a lot of moving parts and we want to try
to clean up as much as possible.

When reverting a cross-cell resize, conductor will:

1. clean up the destination host
2. set instance.hidden=True and destroy the instance in the
   target cell database
3. finish the revert on the source host which will revert the
   allocations on the source host held by the migration record
   so the instance will hold those again and drop the allocations
   against the dest host which were held by the instance.

If the ResourceTracker.update_available_resource periodic task runs
between steps 2 and 3 it could see that the instance is deleted
from the target cell but there are still allocations held by it and
delete them. Step 3 is what handles deleting those allocations for
the destination node, so we want to leave it that way and take the
ResourceTracker out of the flow.

This change simply checks the instance.hidden value on the deleted
instance and if hidden=True, assumes the allocations will be cleaned
up elsehwere (finish_revert_snapshot_based_resize_at_source).

Ultimately this is probably not something we *have* to have since
finish_revert_snapshot_based_resize_at_source is going to drop the
destination node allocations anyway, but it is good to keep clear
which actor is doing what in this process.

This adds the revert_snapshot_based_resize_at_dest() compute
service method which will be called from conductor during
a cross-cell resize revert operation. This runs on the dest
host in the target cell and is similar to
confirm_snapshot_based_resize_at_source() except it destroys
the guest and works on dropping the new_flavor resource usage
rather than the old_flavor. It also sends the legacy
""compute.instance.exists"" notification like a traditional
revert_resize().

As part of this cleanup, the dest host volume attachments
are deleted. The source host port bindings, which are inactive
when this runs, are activated and then the (previously active)
dest host port bindings are deleted. This is to make sure the
ports are not left unbound after the revert.

This adds the logic to the API confirmResize
operation such that if the migration is a cross-cell
resize the API will RPC cast to conductor to
confirm the resize rather than directly to the source
compute service like a traditional resize. Conductor
will then orchestrate the confirm process between the
source and target cell.

Now that the API has confirmResize plumbed this change
builds on the cross-cell resize functional tests by
confirming the resize for the image-backed server test.
To make that extra fun, a volume is attached to the
server while it is in VERIFY_RESIZE status to assert it
remains attached to the instance in the target cell
after the resize is confirmed.

In addition, the FakeDriver.cleanup() method is updated
to guard against calling it before the guest is destroyed
from the ""hypervisor"". This is to make sure the cleanup()
method is called properly from
confirm_snapshot_based_resize_at_source() in the compute
service on the source host.

The _confirm_resize_on_deleting scenario will be
dealt with in a later change.

Functional test test_stats_with_creation has the limitation that it
requires exclusive use of the pool to run successfully.

This doesn't seem to be a safe assumption or even a reasonable request,
since there could be multiple cinderlib CI jobs running in parallel and
most CI systems will share the backend between Cinder CI and cinderlib
CI.

We still want to test that stats gathering does what it should do, or at
least that it looks that way, since we cannot test much given these
circumstances.

We modify the test to check that at least the values are not changed
when we don't refresh, and that they are changed when we refresh after
creating a volume.

Change I1aa3ca6cc70cef65d24dec1e7db9491c9b73f7ab in Queens,
which was backported through to Newton, introduced a regression
when listing deleted servers with a marker because it assumes
that if BuildRequestList.get_by_filters does not raise
MarkerNotFound that the marker was found among the build requests
and does not account for that get_by_filters method short-circuiting
if filtering servers with deleted/cleaned/limit=0. The API code
then nulls out the marker which means you'll continue to get the
marker instance back in the results even though you shouldn't,
and that can cause an infinite loop in some client-side tooling like
nova's CLI:

  nova list --deleted --limit -1

This fixes the bug by raising MarkerNotFound from
BuildRequestList.get_by_filters if we have a marker but are
short-circuiting and returning early from the method based on
limit or filters.

Change I1aa3ca6cc70cef65d24dec1e7db9491c9b73f7ab in Queens,
which was backported through to Newton, introduced a regression
when listing deleted servers with a marker because it assumes
that if BuildRequestList.get_by_filters does not raise
MarkerNotFound that the marker was found among the build requests
and does not account for that get_by_filters method short-circuiting
if filtering servers with deleted/cleaned/limit=0. The API code
then nulls out the marker which means you'll continue to get the
marker instance back in the results even though you shouldn't,
and that can cause an infinite loop in some client-side tooling like
nova's CLI:

  nova list --deleted --limit -1

This adds a functional recreate test for the regression which will
be updated when the bug is fixed.

Also bump horizon to the first stable version
for the stein branch. The b2 release was intended
to be temporary to allow us to bump the dependency
as soon as possible, but there is no py3 wheel
apparently and the lower-constraint job fails.

As horizon is not tracked by requirements.git
limit its upper constraint to the highest version
for this branch to prevent failures due to changed APIs.

Some of networking-ovn functional tests inherit from ovsdbapp base
class. ovsdbapp uses environment variables to define directories
containing database schemas. This patch passes environment variable to
tox if it's defined. If it's not defined, an empty string is used and
code later uses its own defaults.

This patch doesn't go to master as it's frozen now because of the code
being merged to Neutron. The patch will be sent to master Neutron once
code migration is finished.

This patch adds a new project under the Neutron group -
OVN Octavia Provider driver, for Neutron's
interaction with the OVN LoadBalancer for Octavia.

A few days ago the Neutron community decided to merge
Networking-ovn tree with the Neutron tree [0]. Nowadays,
the OVN Octavia provider driver is placed in networking-ovn
repository and it uses Octavia and Octavia-lib. To not
force Neutron to rely on Octavia we should export the driver
to a dedicated repository.

ARM64 testing is of interest to a number of projects.  For example:

 https://review.opendev.org/662456 : kolla
 https://review.opendev.org/676111 : diskimage-builder
 https://review.opendev.org/690798 : system-config (mirror tests)

However, we have been hesitant to put these tests into the main check
queue because with only a small number of nodes available (8
currently) it may lead to long delays merging code.

While jobs could go in the on-demand experimental pipeline, this
doesn't quite reflect the status of the jobs and nodes which are
operational.

I think that a separate queue to allow these jobs to run
automatically, but asynchronously to the regular check queue is a good
option here.  This will be a step to build a strong track-record for
the jobs without affecting the main gate, which should hopefully lead
to more interest and potentially more resources.

The reason for this is that if we consume Octavia from Stein+ in

driver (octavia_api) will not be able to apply the Load Balancers

In case of Keystone Multidomain setup, the project and users list
is empty when the domain context is changed. Horizon uses domain
scoped token for keystone api calls to get list of projects and users.
And domain scoped token cannot get information about projects and users
in other domains, the list is empty.

This patch modifies the use of domain scoped token only when domain
context is not modified.

The bug have 3 parts
1. Users are not listed on GUI in different domain
2. Projects are not listed on GUI in different domain
3. Gui hangs during creation of user/project using + option
This patch handles case 1 and 2.

This feature provides a way for nova-compute services to avoid
deplicated port allocations when re-scheduling happens: in tempest
or bulk creating scenario, neutron-server timeouts occasionally happen
when nova-compute allocate ports in `_build_and_run` codes, and tasks
will be re-scheduled to other compute nodes. However, new compute nodes
know nothing about the allocated ports and will allocate ports from
neutron-server again. This usually leads to orphan ports. If nova-scheduler
service generates ports identifiers before requests passed to nova-compute
services, the existance checks for ports will be possible and already allocated
ports could be reused by nova-compute services.

Starting with Python 3.4, newly-created file descriptors are non-inheritable
[0], which causes trouble when we try to use a pipe for IPC. Fortunately, the
same PEP that implemented this change *also* provided a new API to mark file
descriptors as being inheritable -- so just do that.

While we're at it,

* Fix up the probe tests to work on py3
* Fix up the probe tests to work when policy-0 is erasure-coded
* Decode the bytes read so py3 doesn't log a b'pid'
* Log a warning if the read() is empty; something surely went wrong
  in the re-exec

The flake8 hook for pre-commit installs its own flake8 which is
not what hacking is pinned to. This results in a bunch of errors.
By doing a local hook we can cause these to be the same.

There are flake8 exclusions in tox.ini that need to be used
in pre-commit. Also we should exclude svg files from the whitespace
modifications, because who cares.

Once those are fixed, running pre-commit -a fixes some whitespace
issues. While the normal use isn't to run -a - if someone does make
a patch that touches any of these they'll get erroneous unrelated
errors compared to their lower work - so fix all of the existing
issues, which are mostly space-at-end-of-line issues it seems.

As part of community goal of dropping py27 support[1], we are
moving the devstack to py3 by default[2]. That will make grenade job
to perform upgrade from py2 to py3 which will not work (we have seen
the failure in neutron-grenade job).

To avoid existing grenade py2 job break, this commit moves grenade
jobs to py3 which is what we planned as part dropping the py2 support.

Change I7b8622b178d5043ed1556d7bdceaf60f47e5ac80 started deleting
the associated resource provider when a compute service is deleted.
However, the delete_resource_provider cascade=True logic only looks
for instances on the given compute service host being deleted which
will miss (1) allocations remaining from evacuated servers and
(2) unconfirmed migrations.

Attempting to delete the resource provider results in an
ResourceProviderInUse error which delete_resource_provider ignores
for legacy reasons. This results in the compute service being
deleted but the resource provider being orphaned. What's more,
attempting to restart the now-deleted compute service will fail
because nova-compute will try to create a new resource provider
with a new uuid but with the same name (based on the hypervisor
hostname). That failure is actually reported in bug 1817833.

NOTE(mriedem): Note that in this backport a simple version of
assertFlavorMatchesUsage is added since the original version from
change If6aa37d9b6b48791e070799ab026c816fda4441c is not in Rocky.

When the power update was written [1] to use nova's
os-server-external-events API, the internals of that method had a bug
(see the related bug). Fortunately, the code was written so it works
against the nova side with or without the fix. However, for the sake of
propriety, this commit refactors the code to reflect nova's behavior
more accurately.

Specifically: Previously, it was impossible for nova to respond 207 when
the client sent a single event (as ironic does). The code path
accounting for that 207 existed, but always returned True (""success"")
rather than returning False (""failure"") if the event code was >=400.
Fortunately, the return value is only ever used in unit test, not
production code, so it didn't matter.

With this commit, the 207 path is handled correctly, such that the
method ""succeeds"" if the event code is <400 (which would never happen in
real life) and ""fails"" if the event code is >=400.

Change I1aa3ca6cc70cef65d24dec1e7db9491c9b73f7ab in Queens,
which was backported through to Newton, introduced a regression
when listing deleted servers with a marker because it assumes
that if BuildRequestList.get_by_filters does not raise
MarkerNotFound that the marker was found among the build requests
and does not account for that get_by_filters method short-circuiting
if filtering servers with deleted/cleaned/limit=0. The API code
then nulls out the marker which means you'll continue to get the
marker instance back in the results even though you shouldn't,
and that can cause an infinite loop in some client-side tooling like
nova's CLI:

  nova list --deleted --limit -1

This fixes the bug by raising MarkerNotFound from
BuildRequestList.get_by_filters if we have a marker but are
short-circuiting and returning early from the method based on
limit or filters.

upgrade the Undercloud from Queens (non-containerized) to Rocky

This adds a functional recreate test for the regression which will
be updated when the bug is fixed.

NOTE(mriedem): In this backport the test is modified to create the
server without networking to avoid a NetworkAmbiguous error
which is probably due to some missing NeutronFixture sugar added
in Rocky.

In case when user's security group contains rules created e.g.
by admin, and such rules has got admin's tenant as tenant_id,
owner of security group should be able to see those rules.
Some time ago this was addressed for request:

GET /v2.0/security-groups/<sec_group_id>

But it is also required to behave in same way for

GET /v2.0/security-group-rules

So this patch fixes this behaviour for listing of security
group rules.
To achieve that this patch also adds new policy rule:
ADMIN_OWNER_OR_SG_OWNER which is similar to already existing
ADMIN_OWNER_OR_NETWORK_OWNER used e.g. for listing or creating
ports.

In the sample policy generator, we create a rule that maps the
deprecated name of a policy to the new rule name. For example:

identity:old_rule: rule:identity:new_rule

However, in the policy code, if we see an override of a deprecated
name and no override for the new name, we apply the value of the
deprecated name to the new name. In the above case, this results
in us creating a rule that looks like:

identity:new_rule: rule:identity:new_rule

which is a circular reference and nonsense.

To fix this, I added a check to the deprecated rule logic that looks
for instances where the old override is just a reference to the new
rule. If that's the case, then we don't need to do anything because
it's already doing the right thing.

Pretty much every test case in 'nova.tests.functional' defines an 'api'
attribute, and many define an 'admin_api' attribute. We can pull these
from the class rather than explicitly passing them to helpers. Rework
things so this happens.

Note that the bulk of the changes here are in the
'nova/tests/functional/integrated_helpers.py' file. The rest of the
changes were auto-generated using the following script (my sed-fu is
non-existent):

  $ cd nova/tests/functional
  $ python3
  >>> import glob
  >>> import re
  >>> pattern = r'_state_change\((\n\s+)?self\.(admin_)?api,\s+'
  >>> replace = r'_state_change(\1'
  >>> for path in glob.glob('*.py') + glob.glob('*/*.py'):
  ...     with open(path) as fh:
  ...         data = fh.read()
  ...     new = re.sub(pattern, replace, data, flags=re.MULTILINE)
  ...     if new != data:
  ...         with open(path, 'w') as fh:
  ...             fh.write(new)
  ...
  >>> quit()

(ditto for the other substitutions)

Some manual fixups were required after, which pre-commit highlighted :)

When running the tool against a project with a lot of deprecated
policies, the deprecation warnings overwhelm the important output
from the tool. Since checking for deprecations isn't the purpose of
this tool, let's just suppress warnings and limit the output to the
list of redundant policy rules that the user cares about.

I will note that the suppress_deprecation_warnings member is marked
as test only, but that was targeted at consumers of oslo.policy
rather than oslo.policy itself. I could also argue that we're
""testing"" for redundant policies here, but that feels like semantic
hair splitting. :-)

Without this patch, the policy checker issues a 'failed' result when
checking a system-scoped sample token against a policy string like
""role:admin and system_scope:all"", because the policy checker does not
understand the 'system_scope' attribute that is now in oslo.context[1]
and wasn't parsing the ""system"" scope object from the sample token.
Similarly, it fails on a string like ""user_id:%(user_id)s"" because it
never looked up the user_id from the sample token. This change updates
the policy checker to understand token contexts and policies like these
so that more of the policy defaults in keystone, and soon other
projects, will pass. This also adds a new system-scoped sample token to
check against.

With the change in queens of moving the neutron agents from
containers onto the network_hosts, if those hosts happen to
also be your nova_computes, VM's without a floating ip would
lose north/south network.

Checking for physical_host_group could make this patch work for
neutron_agents_containers on pike aswell, if we want to
backport it that far.

In the sample policy generator, we create a rule that maps the
deprecated name of a policy to the new rule name. For example:

identity:old_rule: rule:identity:new_rule

However, in the policy code, if we see an override of a deprecated
name and no override for the new name, we apply the value of the
deprecated name to the new name. In the above case, this results
in us creating a rule that looks like:

identity:new_rule: rule:identity:new_rule

which is a circular reference and nonsense.

To fix this, I added a check to the deprecated rule logic that looks
for instances where the old override is just a reference to the new
rule. If that's the case, then we don't need to do anything because
it's already doing the right thing.

1. Sphinx 1.8 introduced [1] the '--keep-going' argument which, as its name
suggests, keeps the build running when it encounters non-fatal errors.
This is exceptionally useful in avoiding a continuous edit-build loop
when undertaking large doc reworks where multiple errors may be
introduced.
2. Remove the unnecessary blank line for tox.ini

In Stein the docs target started to fail when new release of
neutron-lib appeared. This is because tox installs neutron and its
requirements without any constraints. To fix this both the upper
constraints and neutron requirements needs to be added to dependencies
of docs target.

Container execs can be more complex than just a user and a command.
It can also use --env and --privileged.

- container_exec_cmd is a new filter that will help to build the
  container exec command from the container data.
- list_or_dict_arg is an utility taken from openstack/paunch which
  allows to build a command and its arguments with list or dict data.

This patch will allow the container exec to work fine when they have
environment variables, like it's the case for Keystone bootstrap.

1. Sphinx 1.8 introduced [1] the '--keep-going' argument which, as its name
suggests, keeps the build running when it encounters non-fatal errors.
This is exceptionally useful in avoiding a continuous edit-build loop
when undertaking large doc reworks where multiple errors may be
introduced.
2. Remove the unnecessary blank line for tox.ini

Some phases of diskimage-builder run outside the chroot environment,
such as the extra-data.d scripts, and don't have access to dib-python.
This means these scripts may choose the wrong python version by using
""#!/usr/bin/env python"" to execute. The svc-map element is an example.

This patch creates a temporary directory and symbolic link for the
correct version of python, then manipulates the environment PATH
to preference the symbolic link ""python"" command.
This will allow elements with these scripts to work correctly with
the version of python diskimage-builder is running under.

After a recent rebase the cross-cell resize tempest tests are
failing but it's not clear why. Looking at one failure the
ConfirmResizeTask destroys the instance in the source cell DB
and then updates the instance in the target cell DB to mark
it as ACTIVE, but then when tempest GETs the instance the flavor
returned from the API is the old flavor which is wrong. The
new flavor should be set on instance.flavor in the target cell DB
during finish_snapshot_based_resize_at_dest before even confirming
the resize.

So this logs the full Instance object from the target cell DB
after updating the status to ACTIVE during confirm resize and also
logs in the API where we got the instance from (which cell).

To reduce noise, restrict the job to only run a single test.
