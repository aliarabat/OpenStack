As we aren't required to re-deploy any more during the converge step
the actions performed by the Upgrade Converge and Prepare are exactly
the same, the only difference is the lifecycle environment file we
use to set and unset parameters.

clasess:

- UpgradePrepare: Stop forcing update-plan-only and then try to do most of the
actions from deployment into UpgradePrepare. This change will force config_download

When a test class sets force_tenant_isolation it implicitly requires
configured admin cred. So is_admin_available() which is being used
to skip tests where admin cred are needed, needs to handle
force_tenant_isolation case also and return true for force_tenant_isolation
if there are configured cred present.

This scenario is triggered when using pre-existing accounts but no admin
credentials in the [auth] setup.

In case when physical bridge is removed and created again it
is initialized by neutron-ovs-agent.
But if agent has enabled distributed routing, dvr related
flows wasn't configured again and that lead to connectivity issues
in case of DVR routers.

This patch fixes it by adding configuration of dvr related flows
if distributed routing is enabled in agent's configuration.

It also adds reset list of phys_brs in dvr_agent. Without that there
were different objects used in ovs agent and dvr_agent classes thus
e.g. 2 various cookie ids were set on flows in physical bridge.
This was also the same issue in case when openvswitch was restarted and
all bridges were reconfigured.
Now in such case there is correctly new cookie_id configured for all
flows.

When a Port is deleted, the QoS extension will reset any rule (QoS

If the Port and the related Interface are deleted during the QoS
extension operation, those commands will fail. This patch makes those

There are different situations when allocations can be orphaned.
Adding a new nova-manage command to lookup at all resource providers
and check against the related compute nodes whether they have
orphaned allocations.

NOTE(artom) Conflicts and notes:

* The big one is conflicts caused by 6b6d81cf2b and the
  bp/placement-mirror-host-aggregates series being absent in queens.
  Git gets tremendously confused about the absence of that code around
  this backport's additions, but all the conflicts actually have an
  easy manual resolution: don't include any of the surrounding code
  in this backport. The ResourceProviderNotFound exception is - wait
  for it - an exception, and it's included here.

* Test inheritance had to be adjusted because in queens the
  ProviderUsageBaseTestCase is in
  nova/tests/functional/test_servers.py and not
  nova/tests/functional/integrated_helpers.py

* mock, collections, oslo_serialization jsonutils, and fake_requests
  imports had to be added.

* ResourceClass is in nova/objects/fields.py instead of its own
  nova/rc_fields. Adjust the import.

* To get get_allocations_for_consumer() to include the entire JSON
  response, the include_project_user param is used instead of its
  future replacement, include_generation.

* The ALLOCATION_PROJECT_USER placement API microversion is used
  instead of CONSUMER_GENERATION_VERSION, which doesn't exist yet.

This adds a new CLI which will iterate all non-cell0
cells looking for instances that (1) have a host,
(2) aren't undergoing a task state transition and
(3) don't have allocations in placement and try
to allocate resources, based on the instance embedded
flavor, against the compute node resource provider
on which the instance is currently running.

This is meant as a way to help migrate CachingScheduler
users off the CachingScheduler by first shoring up
instance allocations in placement for any instances
created after Pike, when the nova-compute resource
tracker code stopped creating allocations in placement
since the FilterScheduler does it at the time of
scheduling (but the CachingScheduler doesn't).

This will be useful beyond just getting deployments
off the CachingScheduler, however, since operators
will be able to use it to fix incorrect allocations
resulting from failed operations.

There are several TODOs and NOTEs inline about things
we could build on top of this or improve, but for now
this is the basic idea.

NOTE(artom) Trivial-ish conflicts in nova/exception.py due to
different exceptions around the newly added one.

NOTE(artom) Notes about nova/cmd/manage.py:

* Trivial conflict due to imports

* collections was missing from imports and had to be added

* The trait MEM_ENCRYPTION_CONTEXT was introduced by the AMD-SEV
  series (bp/amd-sev-libvirt-support), did not exist in stein, and had
  to be removed.

* A new stable-only put_allocs() method was necessary because the
  existing put_allocations() in stein does not allow us to remove
  resource providers from the request.

Manila's tempest tests create test credentials on
the fly using tempest's dynamic test credential
framework. Launchpad bug 1883795 points to an issue
where we're forcing the creation of test accounts dynamically
even when ""[auth]/use_dynamic_credentials"" has been set
to False. The appropriate fix [0] for that bug is to
skip tests that *require* a new test credential.
This leads us to lose test coverage in such a situation.
Currently, manila tempest tests cannot be run reliably
with dynamic credentials when testing DHSS=True drivers.
See bugs [1][2][3][4]; So these tests use the
pre-provisioned test credentials framework
as a workaround. We plan to fix this soon [5].

In the meantime, we don't want to lose test coverage
by turning off dynamic credentials all the time.

So ensure we're running with dynamic creds turned on
for all test jobs except the DHSS=True jobs. After
[5] merges, we can turn on dynamic credentials
everywhere.

The __future__ module [1] was used in this context to ensure compatibility
between python 2 and python 3.

We previously dropped the support of python 2.7 [2] and now we only support
python 3 so we don't need to continue to use this module and the imports
listed below.

Imports commonly used and their related PEPs:
- `division` is related to PEP 238 [3]
- `print_function` is related to PEP 3105 [4]
- `unicode_literals` is related to PEP 3112 [5]

Previously some tests were ignored under python 3 environment, this was
due to some design changes introduced by python 3.7 [1] in the SSL
module of the stdlib. These changes reactivate some of them (some other
are still skipped and needs further works).

Indeed, when we try to use requests with SSL in a monkey patched
environment we faced the following issue:

```
TypeError: wrap_socket() got an unexpected keyword argument '_context'
```

This is due to the fact that we are in a monkey patched environment
where `requests` is monkey patched too.

We don't need `request` for our needs. Indeed we can easily send
http requests through low level socket. Our main goal is to test
our wsgi server and not to test the `requests` library, and `requests`
was just used to make the code more simpler.

In our case we can implement a code dedicated to send request to our green
server, unlock our tests and move away from this bug/side effect.

Also this reactivated test will check WSGI server with and without SSL,
so these changes add changes that allow us to submit a request without
wrapping the socket with SSL.

These changes move away from `requests` which is badly monkey patched by
eventlet [1]. Now we use monkey patched socket and ssl to
request the green server which is executed in background. Low level
(monkey patched) modules could help us to skirt layers that are possibly
badly monkey patched on higher level modules (urllib, requests, etc...).

Previously these tests was ignored surely because the WSGI tests
with SSL were broken due to some design changes introduced by python 3.7 [1]
in the SSL module of the stdlib.

However, unlike the other WSGI/SSL tests these changes don't use
the `requests` module or high level modules which are broken by
the monkey patching of the stdlib.

I suppose previous developers simply turned off all of tests related to
WSGI/SSL without much more details than ""SSL tests with python 3 and eventlet
is broken"" but some of them don't need much more work than just reactivate
them to be ran successfully.

This test seems to work without change, and it run successfully locally.

Let reactivate this test.

Currently, those aggregated addresses are saved by IPSet, causes
all addresses need be took into count when computing the CIDRs
if any address is added to or removed from those addresses.
In large scale, that will cause performance problem as described
in the bug comments.
This patch will change to use a new class named CIDRList to save those
addresses, so only related CIDRs will be renew computed when changes
happened.
CIDRList class provides those methods:
1) get_cidr_list
2) add_addresses_and_get_changes
3) remove_addresses_and_get_changes
4) update_addresses_and_get_changes

DO NOT MERGE

One of the things we discussed at the PTG in the neutron-lib section [1]
is that neutron-lib-current consumers [2] should be using git source
for their required-projects in the gate rather than using those projects
from PyPI. This includes python based jobs (pep8, py3, etc.) as well
as functional devstack based jobs.

This patch tests if neutron is being pulled from git master source or
from PyPI by trying to access a module that's recently deleted from
neutron.

On ppc64le volumes are not discovered on running cinder backup commands.
In the backup logs the following error message is seen:
    _get_host_devices() missing 1 required positional argument:'lun'

Have added additional methods :
    __get_possible_volume_paths()
    __get_possible_paths_by_wwn()

Also modified the _get_host_devices() method to:
    - add the lun argument
    - a check for whether the host is a standalone host using PCI or an NPIV guest using FC path
    - returning the host devices accordingly

Tested cinder backup-create with this change - successful.

Recent changes in some versions of iproute2 CLI output (v4.18),
have invalidated the regular expression used to parse the
""ip link"" output.

To solve this problem and avoid future ones, pyroute2 is used to
retrieve the virtual functions information and set the VF attributes
(spoofcheck, min_tx_rate, max_tx_rate and link_state).

pyroute2 extended the ""ip link"" support to retrieve this information,
adding ""ext_mask=1"" in the get command. If no virtual functions are
present in this particular network interface, the added method,
""get_link_vfs"",  will return an empty list.

The set commands can return a ""InterfaceOperationNotSupported"" in
case the operation is not supported. For min_tx_rate, if the driver
does not support to set a minimum bandwidth, an ""InvalidArgument""
(from a pyroute2.NetlinkError(22)) exception will be raised.

The current workaround patch mechanism only allows for the
'current' (most recent) version of a patch to be used in
workarounds.

There are times when we may want to pin to a previous patch
set. This change enables that option.

According to [a] the revision ID can be:

- a legacy numeric patch number (""1"" for first patch set of the change)
- the literal 'current' to name the current patch set/revision
- a commit ID (""674ac754f91e64a0efb8087e59a176484bd534d1"")
- an abbreviated commit ID that uniquely identifies one revision of the change (""674ac754""), at least 4 digits are required

We also clean up two unused workaround templates.

This patch fixes:
- The IPv6 tag added in the ""host"" file if is supported in
  dnsmasq. That shifts all other parameters in the register.
- IPv6 registers can have more than one IP address; in this
  case, the method ""_read_hosts_file_leases"" should return a

Queens runs on CentOS7/RHEL8. Train runs on CentOS7 upstream,
but only RHEL8 downstream.

It is vastly impractical for a large compute environment to
upgrade the entire environment in one go. Typically there is
a need to do so in batches. Part of the process requires
ensuring that the compute service from Train is running on
the RHEL7 hypervisor so that we can live-migrate instances
between the RHEL7 hypervisor and a RHEL8 hypervisor.

This allows us to evacuate a hypervisor on RHEL7, upgrade or
replace it, then migrate instances on to it and continue
rolling to the next compute host.

This patch introduces this 'hybrid' state to make this
possible.

This updates lower constraints to versions that will work with py38 so
that when we move to running on focal nodes, which has py38 as its
default py3 runtime, the lower-constraints job will continue to pass.

It also cleans out some secondary requirements that are no longer needed
due to our direct dependencies being updated.

Linters are removed that are kept in the global requirements blacklist
as those are not version tracked and are not relevant for our
lower-constraints unit test runs.

As we aren't required to re-deploy any more during the converge step
the actions performed by the Upgrade Converge and Prepare are exactly
the same, the only difference is the lifecycle environment file we
use to set and unset parameters.

This patch refactors both classes, the UpgradePrepare and UpgradeConverge
clasess:

- UpgradePrepare: Stop forcing update-plan-only and then try to do most of the
actions from deployment into UpgradePrepare. This change will force config_download
to false (which will avoid running the full deployment and do only an stack update),
then download the config by invoking get_config from utils and lastly enable ssh
into overcloud nodes, as that part is perforemd in deployment only if config_download
is set to true. Add new attributes to UpgradePrepare so we can override them in
UpgradeConverge via inheritence.

Add a firewall rule for the glance-api-edge service that opens glance's

a glance endpoint at the edge site.

The glance-api-edge service tries to inherit most of its configuration
from the base glance-api service. However, the puppet code that applies
firewall rules requires the hiera key that defines the rule contain the
actual service name [1]. Thus, a rule defined for the glance-api service

When the NetApp backend starts, it needs to know whether the
`revert_to_snapshot` support exist. So, it was retrieving the
licenses and checking if the `SnapRestore` is included. Using a
scoped account, the backend cannot retrieve that information,
though. So, this patch solves it by sending a fake operation
`revert_to_snapshot` that must fail. Analyzing the given error, it
sets the backend support field.

When running os-brick in a virtual environment created by a non root
user, we get the following error:

  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'os_brick.privileged.rootwrap'

This happens because the privsep daemon drops all the privileged except
those defined in the context, and our current context doesn't bypass
file read permission checks, so the Daemon cannot read the file with the
code it was asked to run, because it belongs to a different user.

This patch adds the CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability to our privsep
context so we can load the libraries, but only when we are running on a
virtual environment to follow the principle of least privilege.

This bug doesn't affect system-wide installations because the files
installed under /sys/python*/site-packages belong to the Daemon user
(root), so no special capabilities are necessary.

Part of the ussuri cycle goals was to drop support for python 2.7. This
removes the package trove classifiers for py2 support and drops testing.

This repo does not use reno, so no release note added.

It also includes the following change necessary to get gate jobs to
pass:

Don't duplicate upstream requirements

This repo assumes neutron and its requirements are installed, with
additional local requirements needed that are specific to the project.
This removes duplicate entries in requirements.txt and
test-requirements.txt to avoid conflicting package requirements.

Also updates lower-constraints to match neutron and/or fix lower
versions that are no longer compatible with our minimum runtimes.

Due to a characteristic on ONTAP devices, the volume extend
operation has a max resize size limited by underlying LUN's
geometry, so the support for extend online volumes was
disabled.

This patch fixes it by allowing a volume (attached or not)
to be extended up to 16TB, which is the max LUN size
supported by ONTAP.

NFS online_extend_support is still disabled due to a bug [0]
found on the generic implementation for NFS driver, which
ONTAP NFS driver relies on.

This is a combination of 3 commits.
This is the 1st commit message:

Temporarily disable grenade-multinode jobs

We need to backport multiple gate fixes, disable the relevant jobs.
Backports should re-enable the matching jobs

This is the commit message #2:

Add ensure-tox in functional job

neutron functional jobs run tests using the tox env.
Even tempest jobs need tox to be present to run the tempest
tests in venv. But functional job derived from devstack-minimal
jobs does not make sure tox is present or not. devstack jobs does not
mak sure that as those are not only used for tox run but also for
other integration testing.

Current neutorn functional job failure-
- https://zuul.opendev.org/t/openstack/build/59865004855c404ab18f06fc0ec1d005

let's call ensure-tox role in job to make sure tox is present.

(cherry picked from commit bda80e8e2a94ff3297ec750589cd879896f12c70)

This is the commit message #3:

ovn: Use newer OVS

OVS tag v2.13.0 is not compatible with current used kernel on upstream
Bionic Ubuntu kernel 4.15.0. This patch sticks to commit hash to unblock
the gate. We can either change to newer 2.13 tag once released or better
stop compiling OVS and use one packaged by Ubuntu.

Run functional/fullstack tests with selected OVN and OVS versions

Previously for functional tests OVS version was hardcoded - v2.12.0,
and OVN was installed from OVS repository.

After we merged OVN driver to Neutron tree we run both
Neutron/OVS and Neutron/OVN functional tests in one job.

This patch adds possibility to specify from which tag/branch OVS and OVN
should be checkout.

Link local address is a valid address on IPv6 network when we are using
SLAAC instead of DHCPv6, current interface validation bypass link local
address and fails the introspection.
Interfaces without link carrier don't have link local addresses so this

Debian packages are different from ubuntu packages.
Differencies in /etc/openstack-dashboard:
  - Symlinking {{ python_path }}/openstack_dashboard/local/enabled/ -> /etc/openstack-dashboard/enabled
  - Symlinking {{ python_path }}/openstack_dashboard/local_settings.d/ -> /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings.d
  - Symlinking {{ python_path }}/openstack_dashboard/conf/ -> /etc/openstack-dashboard/policy

Every dashboard-plugin debian package is copying his policy files, local_settings, enabled to above locations.
Every dashboard-plugin is triggering dpkg and collect-static, compress is done by openstack-dashboard package.
Kolla has to remove all these debian package's configs and provide kolla configs.
Move also /etc/openstack-dashboard/policy to standard location and delete symlink as kolla-ansible is overriding
default policy files path to /etc/openstack-dashboard/.

The i18n team has decided not to translate the logs because it seems
like it not very useful; operators prefer to have them in English so
that they can search for those strings on the internet.

Since we have removed log translations completely, we should add hacking
rule to prevent future mistakes.

Due to the way pecan processes exceptions combined with a custom ironic
middleware layer for encoding exceptions we result in a json response
with pecans json response encoded in it. This makes handling ironic's
error messages a nightmare for clients who have to first decode the
outerlayer and then decode the inner json.

This patch moves the exception formatting code to the hooks, which
get executed earlier and receive the non-encoded information.
Then it introduces a new API version, in which the exception information
is no longer JSON encoded. Finally, it makes pecan exceptions look
the same way as WSME exceptions.

- Configure the docker_registry_host variable in the testenvs.

Bionic Ubuntu kernel 4.15.0. This patch sticks to commit hash to unblock
the gate. We can either change to newer 2.13 tag once released or better

Run functional/fullstack tests with selected OVN and OVS versions

Previously for functional tests OVS version was hardcoded - v2.12.0,
and OVN was installed from OVS repository.

After we merged OVN driver to Neutron tree we run both
Neutron/OVS and Neutron/OVN functional tests in one job.

This patch adds possibility to specify from which tag/branch OVS and OVN
should be checkout.

If qemu guest agent is not reponsive when setting admin password,
an InternalError will be thrown by nova,
then the VM state will be set to ERROR.

Actually we did nothing to VMs as qga did not answer our request,
such as qga is crashed/halt, etc.
In this kind of senario, libvirt will throw VIR_ERR_AGENT_UNRESPONSIVE
to us by an error code.
We should check the error code return by libvirt and
throw a NotImplementedError, which we've already expected
in compute.manager.
Other cases like qga got our request
but failed to do its work should follow what we used to.

This patch checks the return code from libvirt.
If got VIR_ERR_AGENT_UNRESPONSIVE,
then throws NotImplementedError.

Switch to openstackdocstheme 2.2.1 and reno 3.1.0 versions. Using
these versions will allow especially:
* Linking from HTML to PDF document
* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Set openstackdocs_pdf_link to link to PDF file. Note that
the link to the published document only works on docs.openstack.org
where the PDF file is placed in the top-level html directory. The
site-preview places the PDF in a pdf directory.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

Remove docs requirements from lower-constraints, they are not needed
during install or test but only for docs building.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

The __future__ module [1] was used in this context to ensure compatibility
between python 2 and python 3.

We previously dropped the support of python 2.7 [2] and now we only support
python 3 so we don't need to continue to use this module and the imports
listed below.

Since we dropped support for python 2 [1], we no longer need to use the
mock library, which existed to backport py3 functionality into py2.
Which must be done by saying::

    from unittest import mock

...because if you say::

    import mock

...you definitely will not be getting the standard library mock.
That will always import the third party mock library.

This commit adds hacking check N366 to enforce the former.

This check can be removed in the future (and we can start saying
``import mock`` again) if we manage to purge these transitive
dependencies. I'm not holding my breath.

As stated in the bug description, there are many writes of the
agent liveness external_ids into the Chassis table. There was a
protection to avoid bumping nb_cfg too frequently.

The same protection is reused to avoid writing into the Chassis
external_ids.

This patch reduces the number of transactions to the SB database
and, therefore, the recomputations that it causes to ovn-controller
in all nodes.

A previous patch[1] missed batch_member_update when adding database
repository ""get"" method retries for new object creation actions.
This patch fixes batch member create to retry the database get call
when new members are being created via batch member update.
This issue only impacts the v1 amphora driver as the v2 driver
does not need to get these objects from the database.

We previously fixed a bunch of places, but not quite *all* the places;
at the very least, some account-layer services (like the replicator and
auditor IIRC) could still bomb out -- and it's important that
replicators still respect fallocate_reserve!

Now, do the NicerInterpolation thing every time we call readconf.
Additionally, clean up the original fix to avoid globally
monkey-patching configparser.
