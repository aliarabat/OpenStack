Designate no longer uses the parameters in the [backend:bind9] section,
since ppols.yaml was introduced. This change ensures the parameters in
this wrong section are purged.

Also, this change introduces support for setting up backend using
pools.yaml according to the current installation guide.

Backport note
- Adjusted some logic to use hard-coded user/group names, because
  34ff6e6f04a69fec9579accc0bcc5f1c29049abe is not present in
  stable/xena.

- Squashed the commit 979dd5b2dc69590a457f2c318b2dfc0fd6810dcd which
  fixed the wrong default dns_port.

""ip link"" commands allow to define VF rates independently.
That means, first ""rate"" (max BW) can be set and in a second
command ""min"" (min BW) (check LP bug description).

However Pyroute2 command to set the VF rates requires to set both.
If one value is missing (""min_tx_rate"", ""max_tx_rate""), the library
sets this value to 0; in other words, the value is deleted.

The Pyroute2 structures are built depending on the parameter names.
In this case, {'vf': {'rate': ...}} will create a ""vf_rate"" [1]
nla structure, that requires ""min_tx_rate"" and ""max_tx_rate"".
This is part of the full structure passed to the ""iproute"" library
[2].

This is an example of code that only sets the ""max_tx_rate"" for
the 15th VF of ""enp196s0f0"":
  $ from neutron.plugins.ml2.drivers.mech_sriov.agent import pci_lib
    pci = pci_lib.PciDeviceIPWrapper(""enp196s0f0"")
    pci.set_vf_rate(15, {'max_tx_rate': 10})

The ""msg"" [3] (structure passed to ""iproute"" library) is this:
https://paste.opendev.org/show/b2FZBOebGOCHMrYhPr6X/. The
""min_tx_rate"" is set to the default value 0.

This patch reads first the existing rates (""min_tx_rate"",
""max_tx_rate"") and populates the command parameters accordingly.

Instances using NUMA topology (hw:numa_nodes) created on Ussuri have
InstanceNUMACell objects with version 1.4. After upgrading to Victoria,
instances with pinned CPUs (hw:cpu_policy=dedicated) get a pcpuset
attribute added. However, InstanceNUMACell objects of unpinned instances
do not get migrated, which causes a failure when restarting existing
instances on Victoria and later:

    NotImplementedError: Cannot load 'pcpuset' in the base class

This change updates the migration function to add an empty pcpuset
attribute to InstanceNUMACell objects missing it. While this code would
apply to both shared and mixed policies, support for hw:cpu_policy=mixed
was only added in Victoria, so those objects should already be using the
latest version including the pcpuset attribute.

After spending huge effort to understand the exact requirements to
enforce SRBAC, we learned it's very difficult to find the required
scope in each credential. This requires understanding implementation of
client-side as well as server-side, and requirement might be different
according to the deployment architecture or features used.

Instead of implementing support based on the actual implementation,
this introduces support for system scope credentials to all places
where keystone user credential is defined, and make all credential
configurations consistent.

For regular Train deployments only create or map the new cells.
That saves a few CPU cycles by not checking for the existing cells DB
URIs formats each time.

When rolling minor updates, only check if existing cells DB URIs have
to be updated into the templated format.

When upgrading from Queens to Train we should remap the default and all
cells DB URIs to the templated format (cell0 requires a special
handling). Use the existing FFU detection condition to trigger that
in deploy steps (docker_config).
NOTE: We cannot use upgrade_tasks for that since these are only to
clean things up and run before the common bootstrap and deploy steps.

In order to retain the expected ordering, move Nova Conductor deploy
tasks to step 4 order 10-12, and align the remaining Nova services:

deploy step 3:
0 nova_api_db_sync_stein stein (if FFU)
1 conductor nova_db_sync stein (if FFU) >>> step_4 10 (to keep it after
                                            cells create/update stein)
1 <<< nova_api_update_cell0_stein (if FFU)
2 nova_api_update_default_cell_stein (if FFU)
3 nova_api_db_sync
4 nova_api_map_cell0
5 nova_api_ensure_default_cell
6 conductor nova_db_sync                >>> step_4 11 (to keep it after
                                          conductor nova_db_sync stein)

update tasks for step 4: remap/update URI in the default cell DB

deploy step 4:
0 nova_conductor, scheduler, novajoin_server
  nova_manager, vnc_proxy, migration_target >>> 12 (run after dbsyncs)
2 nova_api, metadata                        >>> 13 (run after conductor)
10 <<< conductor nova_db_sync stein (if FFU)
11 <<< conductor nova_db_sync
12 <<< nova_conductor and company
13 <<< nova_api, metadata

Additionally:
- Use Kolla configs for the update/map cell containers.

After spending huge effort to understand the exact requirements to
enforce SRBAC, we learned it's very difficult to find the required
scope in each credential. This requires understanding implementation of
client-side as well as server-side, and requirement might be different
according to the deployment architecture or features used.

Instead of implementing support based on the actual implementation,
this introduces support for system scope credentials to all places
where keystone user credential is defined, and make all credential
configurations consistent.

After spending huge effort to understand the exact requirements to
enforce SRBAC, we learned it's very difficult to find the required
scope in each credential. This requires understanding implementation of
client-side as well as server-side, and requirement might be different
according to the deployment architecture or features used.

Instead of implementing support based on the actual implementation,
this introduces support for system scope credentials to all places
where keystone user credential is defined, and make all credential
configurations consistent.

This adds a grenade job that specifically skips the last release,
to prove that we can do it. Such a job would facilitate a new
goal of a tick/tock release arrangement where slower-moving operators
could stick on the ""tick"" release and know that they can upgrade to
the next ""tick"" release directly.

See https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/governance/+/828777
for a proposal on why this is needed, and
https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/grenade/+/826101
for a similar skip level job that's being created from the
integrated grenade job

Heat in undercloud was replaced by Ephemeral heat and we no longer run
puppet to set up heat configurations.

Because there is no heat tempest job enabled in TripleO repos, we use
the common scenario job to validate deployment status. This will be
updated when any appropriate test is enabled in TripleO.

Backport note:
- Because tripleo jobs were removed from stable/xena, this change is
  directly backported from master to stable/wallaby.
- This change adjust OS version (CentOS 8 Stream instead of CentOS 9
  Stream) according to the jobs we have in stable/wallaby.

The anaconda deploy interface has a few issues that are
addressed here:

- fixes logic in get_instance_image_info() for anaconda. If the
  ironic node's instance_info doesn't have both 'stage2' and
  'ks_template' specified, we weren't using any values from the
  instance_info. This has been fixed to use values from
  instance_info if specified. Otherwise, they are set as follows:
  The 'stage2' value is taken from the image properties.
  We use the value for 'ks_template' if it is specified in the
  image properties. If not (since it is optional), we use the
  config option's '[anaconda]default_ks_template' value.
  setting.
- For anaconda's stage2 directory, we were incorrectly creating a
  directory using the full path of the stage2 file. It now
  correctly creates the right directory.
- The anaconda deploy interface expects the node's instance_info
  to be populated with the 'image_url'; added code to do that in
  PXEAnacondaDeploy's prepare() method.
- When the deploy is finished and the bm node is being rebooted,
  we incorrectly set the node's provision state to 'active'
  instead of doing it via the provisioning state machine mechanism.
- The code that was doing the validation of the kickstart file was
  incorrect and resulted in errors; this has been addressed.
- The '%traceback' section in the packaged 'ks.cfg.template' file
  is deprecated and fails validation, so it has been removed.

Currently the emc_share_backend parameter is required. However this
parameter should be set according to the backend and because we provide
independent resource types for individual backends, the expected value
is predictable.

This change defines the default values and gets rid of that redundant
requirement. The parameter is still left so that this change can be
backportable.

Depending on the how the stars align with partition images
being written to a remote system, we *may* end up with
*either* a Partition UUID value, or a Partition's UUID value.

Which are distinctly different.

This is becasue the value, when collected as a result of writing
an image to disk *falls* back and passes the value to enable
partition discovery and matching.

Later on, when we realized we ought to create an fstab entry,
we blindly re-used the value thinking it was, indeed, always
a Partition's UUID and not the Partition UUID. Obviously,
the label type is quite explicit, either UUID or PARTUUID
respectively, when initial ramdisk utilities such as dracut
are searching and mounting filesystems.

Adds capability to identify the correct label to utilize
based upon the current state of the block devices on disk.

Granted, we are likely only exposed to this because of IO
race conditions under high concurrecy load operations.
Normally this would only be seen on test VMs, but
systems being backed by a Storage Area Network *can*
exibit the same IO race conditions as virtual machines.

The current fake NFVO server design is based on a singleton class
pattern which restricts the instantiation of a class to one server
object.
Multi-tenant functional test case environment requires multiple
fake NFVO servers(one server per tenant).

This patch removes the SingletonMixin class and modifies the
FakeServerManager class to instantiate multiple server class objects.

Implement: blueprint multi-tenant-policy

In current implementation, the grant information must be
used when trying to scale out VNF that has a VDU
that is not deployed initially.
But the grant usage should be optional, and so this patch
changes it to be optional.

Session authentication issues can occur when the client
has been initialized and some intermediate failure has occurred
such as a transport failure to the remote BMC or even with setting
changes on the remote BMC.

Previously, these sorts of issues could result in cases where
the client does not properly respond. Either by falling back
to ""basic"" authentication, or getting stuck in a loop where
the client was unable to re-negotiate a new session with the BMC.

In the event of the BMC no longer being able to support Session
authentication, after a session initialization, the client will
raise an AccessError exception to signify to the consumer that
something has occurred with credentials preventing further client
use without potentially re-initializing the client.

Should the re-authentication fail, the exception will be directly
raised such that the client can no longer fall into a recursive
loop.

Should the state in the client be unable to be determined,
and an AccessError is raised, the client will now attempt to
re-authenticate.

Ultimately moves from using the SessionService to using a new
base class method ``create_session``. The SessionService
class ``create_session`` method is still usable as well, however
new authentication attempts will not utilize it in order to bypass
potential failure cases.

Functionally, this change requires change
I9eb238d1bbaf522d03ee3fce12fc0ab80c1b69b4 to be present
as it removes X-Auth-Token headers which can lead to spurious
authentication failures when sessions expire. Prior to any
authentication action, this patch does *also* do the needful
to prevent a poisoned client which would have potentially
resulted in an AccessError previously.

In backporting, also minor conflict with
https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/sushy/+/799504
resulted in a minor change, specifically around the argument
being passed which was added in that changeset. Additional
minor changes around ConnectionError exceptions which
previously did not include the ability to pass a message back
as part of the error.

The deployed metal file comes from the output of 'openstack
overcloud node provision'. If this file's DeployedSeverPortMap
is empty, we cannot map hostnames to their provisioning IPs.
This information is in the inventory however so, if we have
an inventory, then use it to complete the mapping. We do this
by adding an option to ceph_spec_bootstrap to use both the
inventory and the metal file as a source to build the spec.

The cli-deployed-ceph.yaml playbook was designed to work with
an inventory containing only the undercloud and a populated
DeployedSeverPortMap. The ceph_spec_bootstrap module still
supports this behavior though the playbook now passes the
""both"" option and thus requires an inventory with all hosts.
Such an inventory is genereated by 'openstack overcloud node
provision'. When the ""both"" case is used, it is assumed the
inventory does not have the ceph_mon group so the playbook
still dynamically expands its inventory to add it.

Auth uses Connector, Connector uses Auth. This convoluted relationship
results in connector._auth being unset when an authentication request is
made. If it results in AccessError, sushy tries to access non-existing
connector._auth. This change protects against it and allows the actual
error to bubble up.

Session authentication issues can occur when the client
has been initialized and some intermediate failure has occurred
such as a transport failure to the remote BMC or even with setting
changes on the remote BMC.

Previously, these sorts of issues could result in cases where
the client does not properly respond. Either by falling back
to ""basic"" authentication, or getting stuck in a loop where
the client was unable to re-negotiate a new session with the BMC.

In the event of the BMC no longer being able to support Session
authentication, after a session initialization, the client will
raise an AccessError exception to signify to the consumer that
something has occurred with credentials preventing further client
use without potentially re-initializing the client.

Should the re-authentication fail, the exception will be directly
raised such that the client can no longer fall into a recursive
loop.

Should the state in the client be unable to be determined,
and an AccessError is raised, the client will now attempt to
re-authenticate.

Ultimately moves from using the SessionService to using a new
base class method ``create_session``. The SessionService
class ``create_session`` method is still usable as well, however
new authentication attempts will not utilize it in order to bypass
potential failure cases.

Functionally, this change requires change
I9eb238d1bbaf522d03ee3fce12fc0ab80c1b69b4 to be present
as it removes X-Auth-Token headers which can lead to spurious
authentication failures when sessions expire. Prior to any
authentication action, this patch does *also* do the needful
to prevent a poisoned client which would have potentially
resulted in an AccessError previously.

In backporting, also minor conflict with
https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/sushy/+/799504
resulted in a minor change, specifically around the argument
being passed which was added in that changeset.

This branch is no longer actively maintained and one of the
experimental jobs is invalid at this point in time. Removing
it and a similar one since at this point it doesn't make sense
to even keep the old experimental jobs around.

Additionally:
- Removed the standalone job. The standalone job by default
  attempts to run multiple standalone scenarios, which this
  branch is just not equipped to really support configuration
  wise.
- Removed the docs publishing job. At this point queens is
  not going to receieve documentation updates, and the docs
  jobs across all of openstack were impacted by sphinx
  plugins going to python3 only, thus we're likely never
  going to get doc publishing working again on this branch
  without a community wide lift which is also impractical
  given the current state of queens branch support.

During the Ussuri series Extended Maintenance transition we missed
Ironic and Tripleo projects final ussuri release and transition.

Due to release tooling is implemented in a way that no release can be
done if a series is in 'extended maintenance', we need to set Ussuri
back as 'maintained' temporarily until Ironic and Tripleo projects
releases take place, transition them into Extended Maintenance, and
then set back Ussuri series state as in 'extended maintenance'.

`binding:profile` updates are handled differently for migration from
instance creation which was not taken into account previously. Relevant
fields (card_serial_number, pf_mac_address, vf_num) are now added to the
`binding:profile` after a new remote-managed PCI device is determined at
the destination node.

Likewise, there is special handling for the unshelve operation which is
fixed too.

Func testing:

* Allow the generated device XML to contain the PCI VPD capability;
* Add test cases for basic operations on instances with remote-managed
  ports (tunnel or physical);
* Add a live migration test case similar to how it is done for
  non-remote-managed SR-IOV ports but taking remote-managed port related
  specifics into account;
* Add evacuate, shelve/unshelve, cold migration test cases.

""ip link"" commands allow to define VF rates independently.
That means, first ""rate"" (max BW) can be set and in a second
command ""min"" (min BW) (check LP bug description).

However Pyroute2 command to set the VF rates requires to set both.
If one value is missing (""min_tx_rate"", ""max_tx_rate""), the library
sets this value to 0; in other words, the value is deleted.

The Pyroute2 structures are built depending on the parameter names.
In this case, {'vf': {'rate': ...}} will create a ""vf_rate"" [1]
nla structure, that requires ""min_tx_rate"" and ""max_tx_rate"".
This is part of the full structure passed to the ""iproute"" library
[2].

This is an example of code that only sets the ""max_tx_rate"" for
the 15th VF of ""enp196s0f0"":
  $ from neutron.plugins.ml2.drivers.mech_sriov.agent import pci_lib
    pci = pci_lib.PciDeviceIPWrapper(""enp196s0f0"")
    pci.set_vf_rate(15, {'max_tx_rate': 10})

The ""msg"" [3] (structure passed to ""iproute"" library) is this:
https://paste.opendev.org/show/b2FZBOebGOCHMrYhPr6X/. The
""min_tx_rate"" is set to the default value 0.

This patch reads first the existing rates (""min_tx_rate"",
""max_tx_rate"") and populates the command parameters accordingly.

has no attribute 'RULE_TYPE_MINIMUM_PACKET_RATE'
```

On wallaby, neutron-lib=2.10.2 is used in the RDO/Tripleo
Deployment.

https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron-lib/+/816447
Moves RULE_TYPE_MINIMUM_PACKET_RATE to neutron-lib which is available
in Yoga release and not available in wallaby neutron-lib
leading to above failure.

Moving the RULE_TYPE_MINIMUM_PACKET_RATE variable to the setup
method fixes the issue.

Maintaining project lower constraints has become an increasingly
difficult task, especially considering the new pip resolver.

That being considered, the TC has stated that it's up to project
maintainers to decide if they want to continue using lower constraints.
The Cinder project has already dropped the lower constraints job [2]
and we did the same for compute-hyperv [3].

In order to reduce the burden, we dropped indirect dependencies from
the lower constraints file. This is now causing the lower constraints
job to time out:

   This is taking longer than usual. You might need to provide the
   dependency resolver with stricter constraints to reduce runtime.
   See https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/backtracking for guidance.
   If you want to abort this run, press Ctrl + C.

Since we don't really want to go back to maintaining a huge list of
lower constraints, it's time for us to remove the job.

This is failing downstream because the installed curl-minimal does not
have tftp support. This healthcheck likely doesn't add much value
since dnsmasq is a self-contained tool which will be bound to the port
if it is running.

The healthcheck for dnsmasq as a DHCP server has already been
removed[1].

The alternative to removing this check is to ensure the 'curl' package
is installed instead of 'curl-minimal'.

""ip link"" commands allow to define VF rates independently.
That means, first ""rate"" (max BW) can be set and in a second
command ""min"" (min BW) (check LP bug description).

However Pyroute2 command to set the VF rates requires to set both.
If one value is missing (""min_tx_rate"", ""max_tx_rate""), the library
sets this value to 0; in other words, the value is deleted.

The Pyroute2 structures are built depending on the parameter names.
In this case, {'vf': {'rate': ...}} will create a ""vf_rate"" [1]
nla structure, that requires ""min_tx_rate"" and ""max_tx_rate"".
This is part of the full structure passed to the ""iproute"" library
[2].

This is an example of code that only sets the ""max_tx_rate"" for
the 15th VF of ""enp196s0f0"":
  $ from neutron.plugins.ml2.drivers.mech_sriov.agent import pci_lib
    pci = pci_lib.PciDeviceIPWrapper(""enp196s0f0"")
    pci.set_vf_rate(15, {'max_tx_rate': 10})

The ""msg"" [3] (structure passed to ""iproute"" library) is this:
https://paste.opendev.org/show/b2FZBOebGOCHMrYhPr6X/. The
""min_tx_rate"" is set to the default value 0.

This patch reads first the existing rates (""min_tx_rate"",
""max_tx_rate"") and populates the command parameters accordingly.

Instance would be affected by problems described in bug #1949808
and bug #1960412 when queued live migration is aborted.

This change adds functional test to reproduce problems with
placement allocations (record for aborted live migration is not
removed when queued live migration is aborted) and with Neutron port
bindings (INACTIVE port binding records for destination host are not
removed when queued live migration is aborted).

It looks like there are no other modifications introduced by Nova
control plane which should be reverted when queued live migration is
aborted.

This patch also changes libvirt and neutron fixtures:

- libvirt fixture was changed to support live migrations of
  instances with regular ports: without this change
  _update_vif_xml() complains about lack of address element in VIF's
  XML.
- neutron fixture was changed to improve active port binding's
  tracking during live migration: without this change port's
  binding:host_id is not updated when activate_port_binding() is
  called. As a result, list_ports() function returns empty list
  when constants.BINDING_HOST_ID is used in search_opts, which is
  the case for setup_networks_on_host() called with teardown=True.

Fixes ping_results_*.log file name by adding %S to date format string in

This patch fixes a problem that causes a stack update to fail as a
result of changing the multipathd configuration. The original code
modifies /etc/multipath.conf on the host, and uses ""podman cp"" to
refresh the contents of the containers that require a copy.

The original intent was to avoid restarting containers that
asynchronously read from /etc/multipath.conf, but that approach no
longer works. Instead, the new code restarts each container that
needs its multipath.conf file refreshed.

At some point, podman (or something related) started using locks on
files used in a container volume mount. Now, attempts to update the
contents of /etc/multipath.conf inside a container will fail. Here's
an example when running the same command that tripleo_multipathd
executes:

[root@standalone ~]# podman cp /etc/multipath.conf multipathd:/etc/
Error: 2 errors occurred:
        * error copying to container: copier: put: error creating ""/etc/multipath.conf"": copier: put: error removing item to be overwritten ""/etc/multipath.conf"": unlinkat /etc/multipath.conf: device or resource busy
        * error copying from host: copier: get: ""/etc/multipath.conf"": error copying /etc/multipath.conf: io: read/write on closed pipe

Note: The stable/victoria backport includes a couple of fixes
for ansible lint issues that weren't previously detected.

Maintaining project lower constraints has become an increasingly
difficult task, especially considering the new pip resolver.

That being considered, the TC has stated that it's up to project
maintainers to decide if they want to continue using lower constraints.
The Cinder project has already dropped the lower constraints job [2]
and we did the same for compute-hyperv [3].

In order to reduce the burden, we dropped indirect dependencies from
the lower constraints file. This is now causing the lower constraints
job to time out:

   This is taking longer than usual. You might need to provide the
   dependency resolver with stricter constraints to reduce runtime.
   See https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/backtracking for guidance.
   If you want to abort this run, press Ctrl + C.

Since we don't really want to go back to maintaining a huge list of
lower constraints, it's time for us to remove the job.

This change adds a `--trusted-image-certificate-id` option to the
`server create` and `server rebuild` commands. This option takes in a
trusted image certificate ID, which will be used to validate
certificates in the image signature verification process. The option can
be repeated to specify multiple trusted image certificates. If ID values
are not specified using this option, the value of the newly added
OS_TRUSTED_IMAGE_CERTIFICATE_IDS environment variable will be used
instead. This value will be converted into a list before being passed
on.

The `server rebuild` command also gets a new
``--trusted-image-certificates-unset`` option to unset/reset the
trusted image certificates in a server during rebuild. This is
similar to unsetting key_name and user_data during rebuild.

We are going to release Tempest new tag to declare the start of
support for stable/yoga. So that new tag use stable/yoga
constraint in the tox env.

For example: if anyone use Tempest new tag (30.0.0) in future say
1 year later then tox env also should use the yoga contstraint for
compatibility instead master.

These need to be move back to master constraint once release is done.

By using master constraint in tox for all the old tag is problem and
we faced the issue of constraint incompatibility due to that and we
have to work around it all over the devstack, tempest role, grenade to
set the stable constraint cia env var.

[CI] Ironic: use ipmitool retries

In Ironic jobs with Tenks, we saw issues with IPMI commands
failing, resuling in job failures:

  Error setting Chassis Boot Parameter 5

A metal3.io commit [2] was found that fixes the issue by moving IPMI
retries from ironic to ipmitool, which has a side-effect of increasing
the timeout. This change applies the same configuration.

This change has been adapted from an analogous change in
kayobe-config-dev. [3]

This reverts commit 8e36626e3ed41793c79d95951be6000d9b1e480e.

Reason for revert: The update of MichaelRigart.interfaces to v1.13.0
introduced a regression due to
https://github.com/michaelrigart/ansible-role-interfaces/pull/118.
Configuration for active interfaces could be removed and not recreated,
if not present in the kayobe network interface configuration. This
affects the Kayobe development environment, in which the configuration does not touch the host's real network interfaces. That 
would lead to DHCP leases not being renewed, and consequent loss of
access to the host.

The current documentation about source override is ambiguous and let
users presume that you should always use ""-base"" after the project name
you want to override source location.

This assumption is wrong, as kolla look for a section who match exactly
the name of the image. Images who don't have a ""-base"", like Horizon,
are really hard to override for a user.

I propose to put an example without a ""-base"" and also add a disclaimer
in the documentation about that.

This patch will fix the definition of the field of
associated_vnfc_cp_id. In the current implementation,
the field of associated_vnfc_cp_id is not allowed to be null.
But according to ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 V3.6.1, the cardinality of
associatedVnfcCpId is defined as ""0..1"",
which means the associated_vnfc_cp_id is nullable.
Therefore, this patch will fix it to comply with the standard of ETSI.

As a part of the community goal [1], we should replace rootwrap in
favor of privsep.

Although the latest codes don't have a dependency on rootwrap for now,
but it might be happened to introduce a task with root privilege after.
In addition, there are some complex mechanism embeded in Tacker such as
in setuptools or configs under `etc/`. It's hard to drop and restore
them again. So, keep the mechanism active.

In this update, two methods used for tests are implemented in
`tacker/privileged/linux_cmd.py`, but can be used for general purpose.
For the test, it's also including rootwrap for backward compatibility
which will be removed in a future update. It also updates required
libs as bellow for oslo.privsep 2.4.0.
  - eventlet>=0.30.1
  - msgpack>=0.6.0
  - oslo.service>=2.5.0

2. Python 3 fix for sphinx doc

In Python 3, dict methods dict.keys() return ‚Äúviews‚Äù instead of lists.
Therefore, the code:

    impls = sorted(matrix.targets.keys())
    impls.sort()

should be replaced by:

    impls = sorted(matrix.targets.keys())

to be Python 3 compatible.

come out, this change comments out the train jobs to unblock the
gate. Further discussions will happen about potentially dropping
support for Train.

Import and convert the charm README template from an
internal document, and improve upon it.

A few significant changes is the removal of a list of
""important/common"" configuration options and the removal
of a definitive list of actions:

* options - It is felt that a list is too subjective. It
  is also redundant: the options are also available via
  config.yaml and/or viewed in the Charmhub. We should
  instead put more effort into ensuring the options are
  properly described when developing the charm. As a
  mitigating factor towards a loss of value, many
  ""important/common"" options will naturally surface in
  the Deployment section. Showcasing the use of various
  options can also be the subject of future tutorials.

* actions - Similar to options, the actions are already
  listed elsewhere (actions.yaml). It is also onerous to
  maintain an up-to-date list from the documentation
  standpoint.

Only admin users could use the project name instead of project ID and
for non-admins we have no way of checking if the project does exist.

The current situation is therefore somewhat misleading: Admins can
use the project name. If a non-admin uses the project name, it will
fail, but there is no error nor warning.
