Today Nova updates the mac_address of a direct-physical port to reflect
the MAC address of the physical device the port is bound to. But this
can only be done before the port is bound. However during migration Nova
does not update the MAC when the port is bound to a different physical
device on the destination host.

This patch extends the libvirt virt driver to provide the MAC address of
the PF in the pci_info returned to the resource tracker. This
information will be then persisted in the extra_info field of the
PciDevice object.

Then the port update logic during migration, resize, live
migration, evacuation and unshelve is also extended to record the MAC of
physical device in the port binding profile according to the device on
the destination host.

The related neutron change Ib0638f5db69cb92daf6932890cb89e83cf84f295
uses this info from the binding profile to update the mac_address field
of the port when the binding is activated.

The playbook cli-overcloud-node-kernelargs.yaml calls the tuned role
and then the tripleo_kernel role.

The tuned role executes the following command:
    tuned-adm profile throughput-performance

This has the side-effect of adding $tuned_params to the options line
of /boot/loader/entries files, which is required to add its kernel
arguments from /boot/grub2/grubenv.

However when grub2-mkconfig is called, $tuned_params is *removed* from
the /boot/loader/entries files, breaking the enablement of the tuned
profile.

This change runs tuned-adm after grub2-mkconfig, which adds back
$tuned_params if there is an active profile.

Previously we used short living OVN database connection to create
neutron_pg_drop Port Group before workers were spawned. The
pre_fork_initialize actually happens after the api workers are spawned
anyways and it blocks spawning of other workers, such as maintenance,
rpc or periodic. If the OVN database was large it may take several
minutes to connect to the database at scale and this blocks spawning of
other workers. That means connecting to OVN in pre_fork is not a good
idea.

This patch replaces the mechanism by using ovsdb-client to send a
transaction without connecting to the database and downloading the whole
content. The command does following, everything is on the server side:

 1) With timeout 0 it waits for neutron_pg_drop Port Group. If the PG is
    present, the transaction finishes and nothing happens.

 2) If the PG is not present, it times out immediately and commits new
    entries that effectivelly creates neutron_pg_drop Port Group with
    implicit ACLs to block ingress and egress traffic.

The table ""router_extra_attributes"" is a child of ""router"" table.
Each register contains extra information that completes the router
description. When using ML2/OVS mechanism driver, the methods that
create and populate the ""router_extra_attributes"" register are always
called from the L3 DVR, L3 HA and availability zones extensions.

When using ML2/OVN, those extensions are not loaded and therefore the
""router_extra_attributes"" register is not created.

Despite this register is currently not used in ML2/OVN (it will be in
future features), there are some project expecting the
""router_extra_attributes"" register to be always created (for example,
neutron-dynamic-routing [1]).

This patch enforces the child register creating always when a router is
created. This register is populated with the default values. This new
register does not affect any current operation related to ML2/OVN nor
ML2/OVS.

There is a 1:1 relationship between ""routers"" and
""router_extra_attributes"". The child register is deleted by the database
engine when the ""routers"" register is deleted (ondelete=""CASCADE"").

Libvirt needs to be able to plug ports into openvswitch bridges.
It does this using the ovs-vsctl command, which it searches for
in $PATH[1, 2]. This change will optionally install a wrapper
script that executes the ovs-vsctl commands in the context of the
openvswitchd container. This is useful when running libvirt on the
host whilst still running openvswitch in a container. The advantage
of this method over install the packages on the host is that it
ensures client compatability with the daemon. The default is set
to false as the wrapper could overwrite ovs-vsctl installed on the
host.

The function's docstring is a copy/paste of

seems its goal was to make sure the StopIteration exception was properly
handled in CooperativeReader.read(), which is already tested by the

Use an OVSDB lock to ensure that only one worker tries to create
the neutron_pg_drop port group. This also waits pre_fork so that if
getting the port group fails, neutron exits instead of continuing
on without the port group being created.

It was previously possible that a server could create the port
group and we wouldn't get the update before trying to create it
ourselves and checking for its existence.

This also modifies the get_port_group method to use the built-in
lookup() which searches by name or uuid and can take advantage of
both indexing and newly added ovsdbapp wait for sync functionality.

Instead of handling everything in one role - let's have small
fit-for-purpose roles, because in reality these are two hosts
roles and performance should be better with this approach.

According to OVN Upgrade docs [1], ovn-controller should
be dealt with first - let's apply this to deploy as well,
since OVN versions can be changed in a cycle.

Previously we used short living OVN database connection to create
neutron_pg_drop Port Group before workers were spawned. The
pre_fork_initialize actually happens after the api workers are spawned
anyways and it blocks spawning of other workers, such as maintenance,
rpc or periodic. If the OVN database was large it may take several
minutes to connect to the database at scale and this blocks spawning of
other workers. That means connecting to OVN in pre_fork is not a good
idea.

This patch replaces the mechanism by using ovsdb-client to send a
transaction without connecting to the database and downloading the whole
content. The command does following, everything is on the server side:

 1) With timeout 0 it waits for neutron_pg_drop Port Group. If the PG is
    present, the transaction finishes and nothing happens.

 2) If the PG is not present, it times out immediately and commits new
    entries that effectivelly creates neutron_pg_drop Port Group with
    implicit ACLs to block ingress and egress traffic.

Currently, Ceph backups can only be restored to rbd volumes.
The goal of this patch is to be able to fully restore Ceph backups
from/to any backend.

The reason for this is that the current code generates the wrong base
image name when doing a full restore. If we are not using an RBD target
volume, we need to specify the backup in the same way as when a source
snapshot is provided. This way _get_backup_base_name returns the
backup.service_metadata.

In particular, if the backup was created from a snapshot
_get_backup_base_name should be call only with the volume_id.

With release of new setuptools running setup.py --version started
returining extra line. Eventually, running setup.py as a script is not
considered as good practice and we should not rely on it's output much.
Instead, we can leverage importlib.metadata as it should be more
reliable in long run.

The secret will be replaced periodically, in order to make any

When simultaneous attempts are made to add an interface
to the same router including overlapping networks in cidrs,
both attempts are successful. There is a check to avoid this
overlap but is performed when creating the network interface
and it is done over the ports already attached to the router,
so at this moment the check is not able to detect the
overlapping. Furthermore, the create_port operation over the
ML2 plugin  must be executed in isolated transactions, so
trying to control the execution context or adding additional
steps to the transaction is not feasible.

This patch checks once the RouterPort is created on the
neutron database if there is more than one overlapping port,
triggering in that case the exception that will remove the
the culprit of overlapping.

Note: Added clean of l3_obj.RouterPort to avoid errors on
setUp of test class L3TestCase, pick from [1]. Also added
cfg allow_overlapping_ips to True for fullstack job, this one
had been deprecated and enabled by default in newer releases
but added in order to run the backported tests over this

As per 2023.1 cycle testing runtime and community goal[1] we need to migrate
upstream CI/CD to Ubuntu Jammy(22.04). Most of the Tempest jobs will be migrate
automatically once devstack base job start running on Jammy(Depends-On).
As we need to run at least one job on Ubuntu Focal(20.04), I am adding
a new job tempest-full-ubuntu-focal.

Few job like tempest-full-multinode-py3 and plugin sanity job needs to override
the nodeset. multinode job needs to run on Focal till stable/zed and on Jammy
from master(2023.1) onwards. Stable branch jobs testing stable branch needs to
keep running on their supported distro version which is Focal.

tripleo-ansible-inventory was deprecated in

This patch restructures the inventory to allow merging via ansible
e.g by passing multiple inventory files or an inventory dir

The <plan_name> group is now a child of the ""allovercloud"" group (was
vice-versa) allowing the allovercloud group to be merged from multiple
inventory files.

The ""overcloud"" group is no longer a special case and will only exist if
that is the plan name.

generate_tripleo_ansible_inventory now generates a merged inventory to
avoid conflicts in <role_name> group vars.

While we do rotate the ansible.log file, it's never cleaned. This can
lead to some issues, depending on the amount of day-2 operations
(scaling, update, etc) - increasing size without control is usually a
bad thing.

Notes:
- we're using `find' instead of tmpwatch, because we want to target
  precise file pattern to remove. tmpwatch does the exact contrary.
- we're pushing the `find' in the existing container log cleaning, so
  that we don't have to edit newer releases to remove any new script we
  may want to add
- mistral being removed in newer releases (stable/wallaby), we can
  safely make this ""train-only"", and let newer releases override that
  script so that we don't have dangling things

finally, since proxy settings are mostly useless for that specific
usecase, we just discard them by default.

With this patch, the different healthchecks will go without using any
proxy. This is mostly possible because checks are done on ""internal""
networks provided by TripleO, and there's no proxy in-between. Most of
the connections are even on the local node, on its different and various
associated IPs, so there's, really, no need to obey any proxy setting.

By default Rabbitmq's default value of heartbeat is 60 [1].
This should be configurable via kolla-ansible as every
openstack deployment can be different in terms of network
delays, bandwith, number of messages etc.. , so user should
have option to configure when database backend will be shunned.

A reservation could be made that this configuration file
can be added to /etc/kolla/config/rabbitmq.conf or specifically
for the host. But this is not convenient and requires the user
to always check for a new version of the configuration file during
kolla-ansible releases. Unfortunately, this file is neither ini nor
yaml, so merge_configs and merge_yaml cannot be used.

That's the reason why I am adding this to kolla-ansible template.
Default value is not changed, it can be just configured.

Tokens can have a expires_at field (specifically, we're seeing this issue
with Satellite). The token does not an expires_in. This patch allows for
the lookup lookup of either key from the token to resolve
cached token authentication issues.

Example token:
```
{'token': '$2a$09$1b6453892473a467d0737uJ56J02CLEXEkOaX0pdLWgLMlg.qWDSi',
 'expires_at': '2022-10-28T04:54:58.296Z',
 'issued_at': '2022-10-17T23:45:09.306Z'}
```

It's unnecessary to get the local time, since tokens have Zulu time. So just
datetime.now() is sufficient. But to perform the comparison, we need to convert
the string datetime from the return value into a valid datetime object.

This change corrects the describe behavior.

The _update_available_resources periodic makes resource allocation
adjustments while holding the COMPUTE_RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE based on the
list of instances assigned to this host of the resource tracker and
based on the migrations where the source or the target host is the host
of the resource tracker. So if the instance.host or the migration
context changes without holding the COMPUTE_RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE while
the _update_available_resources task is running there there will be data
inconsistency in the resource tracker.

This patch makes sure that during evacuation the instance.host and the
migration context is changed while holding the semaphore.

stable/train specific change: fair locking was introduced from ussuri
forward. See Ia5e521e0f0c7a78b5ace5de9f343e84d872553f9
So the train backport does not add fair=True to the synchronized
decorator of finish_evacuation as that would interfere with the other
functions taking the same lock without fair=True.

Tokens can have a expires_at field (specifically, we're seeing this issue
with Satellite). The token does not an expires_in. This patch allows for
the lookup lookup of either key from the token to resolve
cached token authentication issues.

Example token:
```
{'token': '$2a$09$1b6453892473a467d0737uJ56J02CLEXEkOaX0pdLWgLMlg.qWDSi',
 'expires_at': '2022-10-28T04:54:58.296Z',
 'issued_at': '2022-10-17T23:45:09.306Z'}
```

It's unnecessary to get the local time, since tokens have Zulu time. So just
datetime.now() is sufficient. But to perform the comparison, we need to convert
the string datetime from the return value into a valid datetime object.

This change corrects the describe behavior.

follows that direction and makes sure HA Redis, instead of standalone

I thought we fixed all the double mocking issues with
I3998d0d49583806ac1c3ae64f1b1fe343cefd20d but I was wrong.

While we used both mock and unittest.mock the fixtures.MockPatch
used the mock lib instead of the unittest.mock lib.
The path Ibf4f36136f2c65adad64f75d665c00cf2de4b400 (Remove the PowerVM driver)
removed the last user of mock lib from nova. So it is also
removed the mock from test-requirements. This triggered that
fixtures.MockPatch athat started using unittest.mock too.

Before Ibf4f36136f2c65adad64f75d665c00cf2de4b400 a function can be mocked
twice once with unittest.mock and once with fixtures.MockPatch (still
using mock). However after that patch both path of such double
mocking goes through unittest.mock and the second one fails.

So this patch fixes double mocking so far hidden behind
fixtures.MockPatch.

This patch made the py310 and functional-py310 jobs voting  on master
however that has been dropped as part of the backport.

The existing generic restart_compute_service() call in the nova test
base class is not appropriate for the libvirt functional test that needs
to reconfigure the libvirt connection as it is not aware of the libvirt
specific mocking needed when a compute service is started.

So this patch adds a specific restart_compute_service() call
to nova.tests.functional.libvirt.base.ServersTestBase. This will be used
by a later patch testing [pci]device_spec reconfiguration scenarios.

This change showed that some of the existing libvirt functional test
used the incomplete restart_compute_service from the base class. Others
used local mocking to inject new pci config to the restart. I moved all
these to the new function and removed the local mocking.

In py310 unittest.mock does not allow to mock the same function twice as
the second mocking will fail to autospec the Mock object created by the
first mocking.

This patch manually fixes the double mocking.

Fixed cases:
1) one of the mock was totally unnecessary so it was removed
2) the second mock specialized the behavior of the first generic mock.
   In this case the second mock is replaced with the configuration of
   the first mock
3) a test case with two test steps mocked the same function for each
   step with overlapping mocks. Here the overlap was removed to have
   the two mock exists independently

The get_connection injection in the libvirt functional test needed a
further tweak (yeah I know it has many already) to act like a single
mock (basically case #2) instead of a temporary re-mocking. Still the
globalness of the get_connection mocking warrant the special set / reset
logic there.

Tokens can have a expires_at field (specifically, we're seeing this issue
with Satellite). The token does not an expires_in. This patch allows for
the lookup lookup of either key from the token to resolve
cached token authentication issues.

Example token:
```
{'token': '$2a$09$1b6453892473a467d0737uJ56J02CLEXEkOaX0pdLWgLMlg.qWDSi',
 'expires_at': '2022-10-28T04:54:58.296Z',
 'issued_at': '2022-10-17T23:45:09.306Z'}
```

It's unnecessary to get the local time, since tokens have Zulu time. So just
datetime.now() is sufficient. But to perform the comparison, we need to convert
the string datetime from the return value into a valid datetime object.

This change corrects the describe behavior.

Magnum provides very different information based on whether we search
clusters (using GET against the /clusters endpoint), vs. directly
looking them up (using /clusters/<id>). Most notably, the cluster's
API address is absent from the former method, and is only available
for the latter.

Arguably, someone spinning up a cluster from the SDK might be
interested in subsequently interacting with it using the Kubernetes
API, so that information might be relevant.

Thus, add a get_coe_cluster_by_id() method, so that Connection objects
configured with use_direct_get=True can look up a cluster by ID, and
get the richer data set.

In addition, since the same considerations apply to cluster template
lookup, add a get_cluster_template_by_id() method as well.

By default ADMIN user in the new Secure RBAC policies should behave in
the same way as in the legacy rules so basically every API operation for
any project should be allowed for ADMIN user.
In the new rules there are roles like PROJECT_MEMBER and PROJECT_READER
and those personas don't inherits directly from ADMIN which means that
if something is possible to e.g. PROJECT_MEMBER it isn't automatically
also allowed to ADMIN and we need to explicitly allow ADMIN user to do
such requests. It was done like that for many of API calls already but
not for all of them (probably by mistake).

This patch introduces new composite check ADMIN_OR_PROJECT_MEMBER and
uses it in the check strings where ADMIN or PROJECT_MEMBER user is
allowed to use the API.
It also changes some of the check strings which used ""policy_or"" to
combine ADMIN and PROJECT_MEMBER or PROJECT_READER so that those
composite checks ADMIN_OR_PROJECT_MEMBER and ADMIN_OR_PROJECT_READER are
used everywhere.

Bulk port create without mac address fails as when Neutron calls
oslo_utils.netutils.get_ipv6_addr_by_EUI64, as the mac field of the port
is an ATTR_NOT_SPECIFIED Sentinel() object.

fixed.

Libvirt needs to be able to plug ports into openvswitch bridges.
It does this using the ovs-vsctl command, which it searches for
in $PATH[1, 2]. This change will optionally install a wrapper
script that executes the ovs-vsctl commands in the context of the
openvswitchd container. This is useful when running libvirt on the
host whilst still running openvswitch in a container. The advantage
of this method over install the packages on the host is that it
ensures client compatability with the daemon. The default is set
to false as the wrapper could overwrite ovs-vsctl installed on the
host.

cephadm bits to use package from distro backported from
I30f071865b9b0751f1336414a0ae82571a332530

Added c9s jobs are non voting, as agreed on PTG to focus on Rocky Linux 9.
Since both CS9 and RL9 have higher default fd limit (1073741816 vs
1048576 in CS8) - lowering that for:
* RMQ - because Erlang allocates memory based on this (see [1], [2], [3]).
* MariaDB - because Galera cluster bootstrap failed

Changed openvswitch_db healthcheck, because for unknown reason
the usual check (using lsof on /run/openvswitch/db.sock) is hanging
on ""Bad file descriptor"" (even with privileged: true).

The required implementation in puppet-manila was deprecated during

Because now TripleO supports the PowerMAX backend which replaces it
and the implementation for VMAX backend is not functioning in recent
releases, this directly removes the remaining implementation.

Now, as ML2/OVN is default backend in Devstack since at least

The change bf1e6fd9c187af56911beb7797588b731efe7a04 introduced
the logic to handle the deprecated max_concurrent_builds parameter but
the logic only works when nova::compute::ironic is included BEFORE
nova::compute. This is not always true and can break the existing
usage.

This change ensures the deprecated parameter works regardless of
the order to include classes. One disadvantage of this change is that
the parameter is not longer cleared out by default, but users can still
ensure it is removed from nova.conf by setting $::os_service_default
explicitly.

The deprecated parameter was removed during stable/xena cycle so this
is submitted as a wallaby-only change.

If there is a failed resize that also failed the cleanup
process performed by _cleanup_remote_migration() the retry
of the resize will fail because it cannot rename the current
instances directory to _resize.

This renames the _cleanup_failed_migration() that does the
same logic we want to _cleanup_failed_instance_base() and
uses it for both migration and resize cleanup of directory.

It then simply calls _cleanup_failed_instances_base() with
the resize dir path before trying a resize.

When iDRAC is still loading, some of the components is not available
for short period of time and returns HTTP 500 error with SYS518 error
code and message ""iDRAC is currently unable to display any information
because data sources are unavailable."". There is already retry on GET
errors with Server side error, but this can happen also for other
requests, for example, DELETE.
This patch adds retry for all SYS518 failures disregarding request
method. This helps to fix a known intermittent issue when deleting
set of volumes one after another and iDRAC is reloading after
deleting each volume.

This middleware is used to enable request tracing. At this stage the is
no actual HMAC To start tracing so any value can be put into the
query_string parameter trace_sig. When you do that req will be traced.

The middleware also introduces another option which will trace every x
request. This can be handy if you want to insert the middleware into
something like the internal client config.

The request will start and stop tracing as the request hits this
middleware. As such, to get as much info as possible it's best to have it
as close to the front of the pipeline as possible.

The proxy has been instrumented so when making calls to storage nodes,
so long as the middleware is also inserted into the storage node
pipelines, the tracing context is injected into the sub requests allowing
us to trace a single request throughout the cluster.

Request tracing utilises the OpenTelemetry framework, which has now
become a swift dependency. We could pull this out and warn.

Because a trace is scoped by the request. There is a trace_data object that
is used to store some tracing metadata. Namely:

 - The call stack (so we can name middleware uniquely)
 - The current tracer object. As it's this object that creates spans.

Tracing and eventlet has issues. So we also make the GreenAsyncPool
trace aware, and also created sub-classed GreenPile to
TraceAwareGreenPile, so it can pass a span (if it exists) into the
eventlet environment, allowing them to be traced correctly.

The default behavior in OVN has been to allow traffic by default
unless explicitly blocked. Neutron default policy is to block all
the traffic for those ports that belong to a Security Group.

To implement this with OVN, we created a Port Group 'neutron_pg_drop'
to which we added all the ports that belonged to a Neutron SG.
At scale, this could pose some issues as we could find the PG
with tens of thousands ports affecting the performance.

With this core OVN patch [0], there is the option to reverse the
behavior and Neutron then would need to do the opposite:

- Create a default 'allow' port group and add those ports that
  do not belong to any SG.

- Set the config setting in OVN to change the policy.

- Remove the old 'drop' Port Group

Ideally, this new Port Group will have a lot less ports and
should perform better.

Please keep in mind that:

- This hasn't been tested
- There's no way to tell from the schema if the core OVN knob is going
  to be honored
- There are cases missing in this current patch (eg. port removed from a
  SG)
- No tests added
- No code accounting for the db sync tool
- Maybe others

This is just a quick PoC.

2022 by openEuler community.

The newest LTS version was released in March 2022 called 22.03 LTS.
This release will be maintained for at least 2 years. And the python

This patch adopts the recommendation outlined in  OSSN-0090 [1], in
which two instances of the glance-api service are deployed:
- A ""user facing"" glance-api service, accessible via the Public
  keystone endpoint.
- An ""internal facing only"" service, accessible via the Admin and
  Internal keystone endpoints.

The user facing instance is configured so it does not report any image
location information. This is achieved by configuring glance-api.conf
with the show_image_direct_url and show_multiple_locations set to False.

The internal service operates on a separate TCP port (defaults to 9293)
with its own glance-api.conf that configures show_image_direct_url and
show_multiple_locations set to True.

In order for cinder and nova to have access to the image location data,
both services are configured to access glance via the internal service.

In the above example, the host where the ansible-playbook command
will be run contains a directory of configuration data (one cephx key
and one configuratoin file) for one Ceph cluster. The
`tripleo_ceph_client_files_source` parameter would then be set to
`/home/stack/ceph_files/`. The optional parameter
`tripleo_ceph_client_config_home` defaults to
`/var/lib/tripleo-config/ceph` since OpenStack contianers will bind
mount this directory to `/etc/ceph`.

This patch creates special podman socket for sensubility purposes
on /var/lib instead of /run as it is tmpfs and so permission changes
would perish after reboot.

This patch also removes rsyslog configuration for separate HC log file.
This is not needed anymore since sensubility fetches data straight from podman
instead of parsing the log file.

Sensubility is also set to connect to QDR in scenario001-standalone job
so that it is visible in the logs that HC script succeeds.

Primarily remove the workaround added in
Ia6d512ff2ae417bab938cb095fbb0884d195010a which added
continued use of autocommit, which is incompatible with
SQLAlchemy 2.0.

Also set the environment for unit tests to report compatability
warnings, although it appears none are being reported at this time.

Also cuts out the db upgrade cruft to only use the online database
migration code through oslo_db's enginefacade, which has the smarts
to handle online or offline migrations.

And then, retools unit/functional test data storage to utlize sqlite,
and in that re-tooled the queries to prevent locking conditions
which could exist with queries, and some additional refactoring/cleanup.

Also, don't mock and test time.sleep().

Additionally, it looks like we have discovered the root cause of the
memory/connection leakage issue which has been observed, due to the
way lists of nodes are processed/returned.

In this, we now also make use of enginefacade to simplify our
overall interactions and invocation of the database.

Had to comment out an alter_table operation which was written
around changing an enum declaration. Except that maps to
varchars with a precise length of the maximum enum.
The net effect for alembic was that it was attempting to
copy the table, drop the old table, and then rename the modified
copy. This results in an error such as:

oslo_db.exception.DBReferenceError: (sqlite3.IntegrityError) FOREIGN KEY constraint failed

Since this is outside the supported upgrade window by *years* and
the existing field length is perfectly fine to hold the additional
enums, the migration has been commented out.

Also removes use of ``version_id`` which was previously used
for ORM object deduplication, however this is also reliant upon
in-memory state being authoritative which is problematic in
itself, espescialy when load balancers are involved.

It looks like a raise statement was left in the virtual_size property

point. All the other inspectors return zero for virtual_size if the

converts that raise to a log, and adds a test to make sure we make it
far enough in the processing of the complex VMDK format to ensure that

This change ensures that required package is installed on the host where
uWSGI is being built.

We don't need to force reinstall during an openstack upgrade because
uWSGI version was bumped in Zed[2] so uWSGI is going to be
reinstalled/upgraded anyway.

Today Nova updates the mac_address of a direct-physical port to reflect
the MAC address of the physical device the port is bound to. But this
can only be done before the port is bound. However during migration Nova
does not update the MAC when the port is bound to a different physical
device on the destination host.

This patch extends the libvirt virt driver to provide the MAC address of
the PF in the pci_info returned to the resource tracker. This
information will be then persisted in the extra_info field of the
PciDevice object.

Then the port update logic during migration, resize, live
migration, evacuation and unshelve is also extended to record the MAC of
physical device in the port binding profile according to the device on
the destination host.

The related neutron change Ib0638f5db69cb92daf6932890cb89e83cf84f295
uses this info from the binding profile to update the mac_address field
of the port when the binding is activated.

os-vif currently set the requested mtu as part of separate request

This change moves the mtu update request into ovsdb transaction.

openstacksdk-functional-devstack jobs use master constraints and
also supposed to be run on stable branches. But sometimes master
constraints does not match with the versions present in old nodeset
in stable branches. For example, new constraints of 'coverage' 6.4
 I80d5c5bc2f379a9bac41e4bb40594a253853ee12
broke this job run on stable/ussuri. If we are using the master
constraints in this job then we should use compatible nodeset.

Libvirt 7.7 changed the mdev device naming to include the parent PCI
device when listing node devices. The domain, however, will still only
see the UUID and not see the parent PCI device. Changing the parsing to
simply drop the PCI identifier is not enough as the device cannot be
found when attempting to lookup the new ID.

Modify the Libvirt Driver's _get_mediated_device_information to tolerate
different formats of the mdev name. This first uses the legacy behavior
by trying to lookup the device name that is passed in (typically
mdev_<uuid> format) and if that is not found, iterates the list of mdev
node devices until the right UUID is found and selects that one.

Note that the lookup of the mdev device by UUID are needed in order
to keep the ability to recreate assigned mediated devices on a reboot of
the compute node.

Additionally, the libvirt utils parsing method mdev_name2uuid, has
been updated to tolerate both mdev_<uuid> and mdev_<uuid>_<pciid>
formats.

Today Nova updates the mac_address of a direct-physical port to reflect
the MAC address of the physical device the port is bound to. But this
can only be done before the port is bound. However during migration Nova
does not update the MAC when the port is bound to a different physical
device on the destination host.

This patch extends the libvirt virt driver to provide the MAC address of
the PF in the pci_info returned to the resource tracker. This
information will be then persisted in the extra_info field of the
PciDevice object.

Then the port update logic during migration, resize, live
migration, evacuation and unshelve is also extended to record the MAC of
physical device in the port binding profile according to the device on
the destination host.

The related neutron change Ib0638f5db69cb92daf6932890cb89e83cf84f295
uses this info from the binding profile to update the mac_address field
of the port when the binding is activated.

We've replaced deprecated deployed-neutron-port.yaml template in
standalone/undercloud deployment, thus we no longer need the old
DeployedServerPortMap.

This also removes the IPPools parameter, which is no longer used now.
The parameter was previously used to define the additional ip on ovs
bridge but was replaced by the VipPortMap parameter.

The DeployedServerPortMap parameter was already deprecated[1] in favor
of the new NodePortMap, ControlPlaneVipData and VipPortMap. This change
ensures the deployment command use the new parameters.

Note that the old parameter is still kept until the environment file
is updated to use the new deployed-ports.yaml template.

of munch. This also allows us to stop importing and inheriting from

dopped since it is being pretty awkward.

previously `create_user` would send a ""password"" and ""description"" to
keystone even though they where `None`. However keystone will fail
decoding the ""password"" as tries to parse `None` as a string which
fails.

Therefor we now skip sending the password if its None. Same applies to
the description.
