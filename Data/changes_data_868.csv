In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

Replaces some of the nova API calls with updates. The code looks really
complicated (because it is) and the reason is that the notification
processing isn't sequential; unlike the unit test, the vast likelihood
in reality is that many of the notifications for an instance will be
received almost simultaneously. As such the partial updates request the
document from the index, and then check the existing state fields. The
update is submitted with the existing version as a kind of transaction
check. This seems to work ok, and most importantly the create.end event
should always add the actual current state.

Patch also adds support for pause, shutdown and suspend (and their
counterparts) such that there'll be a state change update followed by a
full API update on the .end event.

Unit tests include some examples of boot, delete and power change
events.

Simplify the base neutron profile so that we always include
the neutron and neutron::config classes at step 3. In doing so
we can now simplify the pacemaker version to use a simple include
which will avoid duplicate class errors.

It seems there are a few cases where properties are assumed to be on
the scope which are not present; particularly $scope.strings.  This
may be causing trouble with some of the features depending on how
they are initialized.

There may be other ways to fix the problem, but this JS should be
made safe regardless.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

In case of ports, it is also added to the API, as a readonly field.
It will be used for any port-specific internal information ironic
needs to store inside the port object. In this change we start using
it to store UUIDs of the cleaning ports that ironic creates, instead
of fiddling with port.extra['vif_port_id'], as extra is intended for

Rather than enabling ceph and cloud archive repos by default when when
configuring test instances to use our apt repo mirrors write out
configures for them in another directory which can be optionally

This prevents growing dependencies on these repositories except for
where explicitly desired.

To use a mirror either symlink to the sources.list.available.d/ files or
copy them into sources.list.d/ and rerun apt-get update.

This is an alternative implementation for Ansible deploy driver
proof of concept.

Each action is described by single playbook with roles, which is run whole.
Control of deployment types and cleaning steps is through tags and
auxiliary steps file for cleaning.
The playbooks for actions can be set per-node, as is cleaning steps
file.

Supports whole images and partition images with local boot:
- compressed images are downloaded to RAM and converted to disk device;
- raw images are streamed to disk directly from HTTP;
- config drive partition is currently supported for partition images only.

Cleaning is supported, only one clean step for disks shredding in PoC.

Requires Ansible >= 2.0.1
Neutron is mandatory.

Deploy ramdisk requirements: Python, sshd and used utilities.

Experimental DIB element:
https://github.com/pshchelo/stackdev/tree/master/dib_elements/ironic-ansible

Experimental TinyCore-based ramdisk
https://github.com/pshchelo/irsible

Tested on DevStack with VM.
128 MB RAM is found enough for a VM to deploy a standard qcow2 Cirros image
(download to RAM + convert to disk device) when using TinyCore-based
deploy ramdisk.

TODO:
- make scripts in ""files"" folders proper Ansible modules
- add callback hoooks for better logging during long single playbook run
- document variables available to playbooks

Size of deployment_info field in tasks table grows as n**2
(depending on number of nodes). If we have 200 nodes, the
size of the structure is about 20Mb. In case of 600 nodes it
would be theoretically about 720Mb, in practice it doesn't fit
into 1Gb.

Good solution is to put common part to separate place. But it's
not so fast. Also it will not help if all nodes will be going to
be deployed with customized deployment info.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

If searchlight's deployed in a shared ES cluster it's likely there'll
be server-wide default settings for indices that aren't beneficial to
Searchlight (logstash, for instance, recommends much larger indexing
latency than Searchlight since it's handling extremely high write
throughput). This patch allows index settings to be specified for indices
created by searchlight-manage. These settings can be specified in the
elasticearch.index_settings config option as a comma separated key_value
list, and can include any of the settings in
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules.html

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

1. What is the problem
When running DevStack script of the Tricircle, during the setup
of Nova_apigw, script tries to add some configuration options to
the Neutron configuration file. However this file doesn't exist
at that time, thus script fails.

2. What is the solution to the problem
Stop modifying the Neutron configuration file during the setup
of Nova_apigw. Instead, we modify that file during the setup
of Neutron server.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
   to realize the solution
No new features. Some lines of scripts are removed.

In order to prepare for implementing requirements management by the
OpenStack requirements management process, and to improve the
reliability and effectiveness of test execution, this patch implements
some changes to the tox configuration:

- The minimum tox version is increased in order to be able to use
  constraints for the python packages.
- The OpenStack upper-constraints are used when preparing the test
  venv for the linters checks.
- Any proxy environment variables set on the test host are passed
  into the venv to enable testing from behind a proxy.
- The environment variables used by Ansible tests are moved into
  a new venv called 'ansible' and this environment is inherited
  by all Ansible-related tests.
- The docs test will clean-up an existing build directory before
  executing the docs build.
- The releasenotes build cannot use upper-constraints at this point,
  so it doesn't.
- The Ansible role download will no longer ignore errors so that any
  problems discovered will result in a failed test.
- The human readable logging callback plugin is implemented for
  functional testing.
- The ansible test requirements are moved into tox.ini to ensure
  compliance for requirements.txt/test-requirements.txt for the
  global-requirements management contract.
- The ~/.ansible directory as a whole is not deleted. Instead only
  the plugins and roles folders are deleted to ensure that zuul's
  Ansible artifacts are left in-place.
- The ansible-lint version is updated to support execution against a
  folder, and the test now executes against the entire role to ensure
  that it captures all applicable files for lint testing.

This will force pip install to use the upper-constraints.txt specified
version of pip modules. When you don't do this, you are out on the
bleeding edge and become unstable everytime some python library in the
wide world changes in a way that you don't expect.

The releasenotes job has no constraints file, so override the install
command there.

This commit is being proposed on stable/liberty and therefore the
install command includes the clear designation of the branch. This is
because, on branches other than master, we need to be sure to get the
upper-constraints.txt file for that branch.

1. Change cert plugin from snakeoil to simple_certificate

The snakeoil plugin offers more functionality, but requires a little
more setup.  Ultimately, though, we will likely replace this plugin
with the dogtag plugin, if we do not disable the cert functionality
altogether.

For now, as at least one plugin is required, we use the
simple_certificate plugin, which requires no setup.

2. Make sure Barbican packaging is installed before db-sync

CI is currently failing because db-sync does not work, python-pymysql is
installed *after* running db-sync and this is wrong.

This patch makes sure things like this don't happen anymore.

3. Move keystone settings to barbican.conf

The current settings (in barbican-api-paste.ini) were not working
and putting them in barbican.conf is more in line with other projects.

Now the tests are more stable, we would like to make them voting like
other modules.

This patch will enable voting again for beaker jobs.

When extracting translation messages from AngularJS templates,
there is no need to keep whitespaces in the messages as there is
no meaning of repeated whitespaces in HTML.
This will make translation effort much simpler.
More detail is described in the bug report.

This commit trims such whitespaces. Django provides a convenient method
to do the same purpose for 'trimmed' option in Django templates.
This method is reused in this commit as well.

Watcher is part of the OpenStack big-tent and is formally
known as ""OpenStack Infrastructure Optimization service"".

Whilst it provides a range of default goals and strategies,
the most relevant case is to enable re-balancing of the
compute hosts by taking CPU usage (data from Ceilometer)
into account and live migrating instances as required.

Currently this only builds the Docker images for type source
but binary builds are gracefully ignored.

The ansible configurations will be part of a later commit.

zaqar-ui was using (by default) an independent release model,
although it was never released. However it would prefer to use
stable branches over a forever compatible-with-all-past-releases
model, so a cycle-following model is better suited for its goals.
Since it was never released before, it is still time to adjust it
before we process newton-2.

Change swift.proxy.server.Application.error_occurred()
to decode message as utf-8 in same way that the
exception_occurred() method was changed in [1].

This prevents a unicode error when logging error responses
in swift.proxy.controllers.base.Controller._make_request()
for paths that have non-ascii characters. Although the unicode
error is currently caught by a surrounding except clause, the
logging and error limiting treatment is different for ascii
vs non-ascii paths. This patch makes them consistent.

Fix the server type reported in _make_request() to be
the correct server type, not always 'Container Server'.

Fix path arg passed to _get_conn_response in
swift.proxy.controllers.obj.BaseObjectController to be req.path
rather than req.

Add unit tests for error_occurred() being called with non-ascii
paths and extend tests for exception_occurred() (see Related-Bug).

The original commit changes ceph-rgw to listen on all
addresses (0.0.0.0:6780), which means that it listens on
both the storage_interface address and the VIP.

This makes it incompatible with having HAProxy on the same
host.

to py34, as that would suffice to ensure coverage.

This is to copy fix of bug 1439869 from Nova to os-brick.

Currently iSCSI volume attachment fails if iscsi_use_multipath is
set to True. This is because the encryptor requests cryptsetup
to create the symlink to the LUKS device with the same name of
the device-mapper multipath device. To avoid the name collision,
this patch adds the 'crypt-' prefix to the symlink.

debtcollector is used to deprecate the old one, and inheritance makes sure the

Remove all *.pyc files in $DEST when executing clean.sh

Currentlly, the *.pyc files could not be removed in any scripts or
functions. But the redundant files would lead stack.sh not to find the
correct script for some versions after branch switched from master to
stable/mitaka in migration_helpers.sync_database_to_version.

So this commit adds the process of cleaning all the *.pyc files in
clean.sh.

It is needed to execute clean.sh before re-stack.sh to prevent the
exception.

Bug 1591766 unveiled an issue where calling the plugin API does not trigger
DHCP notifications. This is required by the auto-allocated-topology service
plugin that calls core_plugin.update_network(), and expect notifications
to be sent out on state changes. To accomplish this, the logic has been
encapsulated in the DHCP module, and leveraged via callback mechanisms.

For this reason, new events have been introduced, AFTER_REQUEST, and
BEFORE_RESPONSE. The latter in particular is the one needed to hook up
dhcp notifications in order to preserve backward compatibility.

More precisely, core plugins that use DHCP as is or implement their own,
(with or without an agent) should already instantiate their own notifier,
and if they do not, this should be rectified.

A search on codesearch.openstack.org reveals that out-of-tree plugins
already specify their own notifiers, and the default initialization is
clearly redundant now.

Most of the Java API alarm tests were randomly failing because the
metrics that should create an Alarm were arriving at the Threshold Engine
before the new Alarm Definition does. Added a small sleep to ensure the
new Alarm Definition gets there first.

The first Alarm test was often failing with the Java API because
keystone was taking to long to respond. Increase the time the Java
API will wait for a response to 5 seconds.

There is still a statistics test that fails consistently. It will be fixed
in a separate commit.

This is the second patch in a sequence to implement the
blueprint.

The patch implements the quota driver changes that will be
needed by the new nova-manage quota_usage_refresh command.

A new quota API is added to refresh the quota usages of the
selected resources. The API will only refresh syncable quota
usages scoped to the project_id and user_id passed in
(note the user_id is optional).  If a resource is passed in
which is not allowed to be refreshed, then an exception is raised.

Implements blueprint: refresh-quotas-usage

This change removes usage of eventlet timers.

This allows coordinator heartbeat/watchers to work correctly
when the main thread is stuck for any reason (IO, time.sleep, ...).

This also fixes a concurrency issue in the notification-agent between
stop/reload_pipeline/refresh_agent that manipulate listeners.

For example a listener stopped by stop() could be restart by
reload_pipeline or refresh_agent. Now we use the coord_lock to
protect the listener manipulations and ensure we are not in a shutdown
process when we restart it.

This bug can't occurs with greenlet because we don't monkeypatch system
call for a while now and all of this methods wasn't ran in concurrency
manner. But remplacing greenlet by reel thread have show up the bug.

define __eq__ for it to work properly [1].There are no implied
relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of x==y
does not imply that x!=y is false. Accordingly, when defining
__eq__(), one should also define __ne__() so that the operators

The designate::dns class was really just configuring things
according to a bind9 backend. As such, move it's resources to
the bind9 backend manifest and deprecate this class.

Additionnally, we stop managing configuration files resources
inside /var/lib/designate. According to upstream documentation
[1] and from discussing this with upstream developers, this is
not an intended way of configuring designate.
This also avoids having to manage permissions (and selinux)
between designate and bind.

As per https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ConfigOptionsConsistency

Note that the 'attestation_port' option, while representing a port
number, is supposed to be a string of digits. Changing this to an
integer so that PortOpt could be used would require a code change as
well, so it's being left as a StrOpt.

Also note that there are some opts that have been added since the
original scheduler option move that lack proper help strings. They will
be fixed in the next patch.

This change enables our repo-build process to store the package sources
for all of our requirements within a given release. This change enables
the ability to have a multi-archetecture / multi-distro / multi-interpreter
deployment.

Because a python wheel can be tied to a particular archetecture, distro, or
interpreter wheels alone can not be relied on to power a mixed environment. The
source is needed to ensure pip is able to resolve a package depenedency even if
a pre-built wheel does not meet the python or system requirements. To enable
this a task has been added to the repo_build.yml file to first download all of
the sources in non-binary format, once downloaded the sources are used to build
all of the wheels locally.
