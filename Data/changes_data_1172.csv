ml2_vxlan_allocations, ml2_gre_allocations, ml2_vlan_allocations tables
have the 'allocated' field.

There are a lot of similar queries to these tables which look
like the following:

SELECT ml2_vxlan_allocations.vxlan_vni
AS ml2_vxlan_allocations_vxlan_vni,
ml2_vxlan_allocations.allocated
AS ml2_vxlan_allocations_allocated
FROM ml2_vxlan_allocations
WHERE ml2_vxlan_allocations.allocated = 0 LIMIT 1;

Performing such selects can take quite a lot of time and if a transaction
which performs allocation is executed in parallel, it can lead to
allocation failure and retry.

Adding an index on ""allocated"" column significantly improves
the performance. For ml2_vlan_allocations table created
an index on (physical_network, allocation) together.

Example for MySQL for execution of query
select * from ml2_vxlan_allocations where allocated = 0;
when on the table with ~3 mln entries, ~500K of which
have allocated = 0:
+-----------------------+---------------------+

Hypervisor stats was being called from the Hypervisors class, which means that
the statistics were being modeled as if they were a single Hypervisor. This
mostly worked, except that the stats didn't have an id field so a call to
__repr__() (implicitly called by print, or in the REPL) would throw an
AttributeError.

This patch creates a new class HypervisorStats which models a collection of
statistics about hypervisors. So you can now call:

  nc.hypervisor_stats.statistics()

The old call of

  nc.hypervisors.statistics()

is left for backward compatibility but just calls into the new method.

Those tests should be unbound from general L3 agent unit tests to make
it clear what's covered by tests (not many) and what's not (a lot).

This required some code shuffling. Specifically,

- a new l3_helpers module is created that now contains code common to
  test_l3_agent and new test_ra that is needed to instantiate L3 agents
  in unit testing environment. It's mostly around registering options,
  setting mocks, but also helper functions: router_append_interface,
  prepare_router_data, get_ha_interface.
- added a new agent_host argument to process_router_ipv6_interface_added
  to specify host name for L3 agent to start with since now that the
  method is used from multiple different test cases, we should not
  hardcode it.

As a bonus, we are now able to untangle functional test_l3_agent from
unit test test_l3_agent module.

More in depth use with ceilometer and gnocchi revealed that
establishment of the wsgi-intercept must be delayed until
after fixtures have had a chance to run. The fixtures do things
like establishing oslo_config.cfg which some WSGI app factories
need immediately.

Fixtures are also capable now of causing an entire TestSuite to be
skipped if some prerequiste cannot be satisfied (for instance a
database in not available). This has made it possible to easily
integrate the gabbi-drive tests on the same tox targets as other
unit tests.

This patch scopes the agent to plugin security group rpc interface
using a messaging namespace.  Right now some plugins expose several
interfaces via the default namespace.  This effectively means they are
a single API and should be managed with a single version stream.  It's
much more managable to just treat these as separate interfaces and
this change makes that explicit and functionally true.  Now when a
method is invoked, the only classes considered for handling that
request will be ones marked with the right namespace.

The following ML2 driver API changes are required to support
hierarchical port binding:

* Add segments_to_bind PortContext property containing the list of
  network segments with which a mechanism driver should try to bind
  the port. All mechanism drivers that bind ports should now use this
  property in place of network.network_segments, which contains only
  the network's static segments.

* Replace several PortContext properties (bound_segment, bound_driver,
  original_bound_segment, original_bound_driver) with new properties
  (binding_levels, top_bound_segment, bottom_bound_segment,
  original_binding_levels, original_top_bound_segment,
  original_bottom_bound_segment) in order to represent hierarchical
  bindings.

* Add stubbed-out continue_binding() method to PortContext, allowing
  mechanism drivers to partially bind the port.

All existing drivers and unit tests are updated accordingly.

The DB schema changes and logic required for hierarchical port binding
will be implemented in dependent patches.

The previous attempt to do this in

oslo/messaging/notify/_impl_test.py which imported the symbols from
oslo_messaging/notify/_impl_test.py. That doesn't actually work, because
the functions to reset the notifications modify the copy of the symbol
in the oslo_messaging package, but the designate tests are still looking
at the copy in oslo/messaging.

This change imports a copy of the module from oslo_messaging in the
oslo/messaging namespace to make certain that the same module object,
and therefore the same global data structure, is used no matter which
path the code is accessed.

The designate team still needs to fix their fixture, but this will let
us release oslo.messaging without breaking their tests in the mean time.

Currently, we use constant value quorum=1 to check if there are enough
datapoints, however, this is not quite right for an alarm rule.

Image evaluation periods is set to, for i.e., 3 for an instance on
cpu_util greater or equal than 80%. Here are the cases which current
may not work as expected:

1. when system start or instance is just created, we may only get one
or two samples for the instance
2. when system is somewhere broken, or an instance is restarted (after
being shutoff), sample may fail to be collected in some time, so we only
get one or two sample in that time range

We want to avoid a spurious data peak, for example, instance cpu_util can
be 50%, 50%, 50%, 90%, in such case, alarm will not be triggered, but if
instance cpu_util is None, None, None, 90%, current code will think alarm
should be triggered, which is not consistent and may confuse end users.

This patch will put alarm to insufficient data when datapoints are less
than evaluation periods.

Now that everything has been converted to scss, splitting out the
individual components of our CSS can and should begin!
In an effort to do small changes (to keep them mergable and reviewable)
I'm only splitting out the topologies stuff.  I'm trying to
balance the style that Maxime has used throughout the previous reviews
relating to this blueprint while also not changing everything that can
be changed.

Note: I've only split out the topology stuff.  No cleanup has happened
at all.

Note: Patch Set 7 was a re-start.  I started from scratch.

The current rate limit is 200 requests per minute. I'm getting
consistent tox failures as the machine is exceeding this rate. The fix
impacts only test code and adjusts the limit and a test that has a
hard-coded reference to the old limit. Why 500 you may ask? Because
600 worked and 450 failed consistently with the rate limit error.

In addition, the change addresses the fact that some test
configuration values are duplicated in the test; the change makes the
test reference the configuration value.

Introduce an additional IP address validation instead of assuming
that netaddr provides it.  Namely, it ensures that an address
either has ':' (IPv6) or 3 periods like 'xx.xx.xx.xx'. (IPv4)

The ""'1' * 59"" test case recently introduced by
commit 1681f62ec91b6c3705a14393815542dc1746de71 fails on
some platforms because it's considered a valid address by
their inet_aton.  Examples of such platforms: NetBSD, OS X

While one might argue it's a fault of the platforms, this is
a historical behavior which is probably too late to change there.

(The breakage has been hidden by later UT changes in
commit 35662d07628452d14306f5197871ad64f6396ff3 .
This commit includes a UT change to uncover the problem again.)

Initially, the module was not creating an ironic.conf file and now
it does.  The configurations that are being put into the ironic.conf
file come straight out of the documentation.

The ironic-conductor service requires the execution of 'ironic-dbsync'
before it can be active.

In the params module, the 'RedHat' packages and services were named
incorrectly or were otherwise missing.

multiple files which was blocking us to migrate multiple files at once.

Cinder volume manager uses validate_connector() method to verify if required
information is in connector when handling initialize_connection() request.
validate_connector() is actually a pure input validation method, basically
checking if 'initiator' or 'wwpns' is in connector if storage protocol is
iSCSI or FC.  However, when required information is missing, currently drivers
raises either VolumeBackendAPIException or VolumeDriverException, which would
then bubble up to API and then to user (Nova) as InternalServerError.

This change adds a new exception - InvalidConnectorException, that drivers
should raise when connector is found not valid.  With that, Cinder API would
raise BadRequest instead to user, suggesting things are missing in request.

the windows cinder driver will use that IP to connect to the target

This patch allows router-vm plugin to override router port creation/deletion.
When router functionality is realized by vm, neutron router ports (gateway
or interface port) are basically connected to vm as vNIC. (the details depend
on its realization)
Example: when a router is deleted, the vm still alive and the port is still
connected. The actual port deletion needs to be deferred until VM deletion.
Another example: suppose the vm doesn't support hot-plug, and vm is booted
with ports attached. When router port is attached/detached, those pre-created
port will be used/returned.

ovs can create device if the port has type=internal. Currently,
we use `ovs-vsctl -- del-port foo -- add-port foo -- set Interface
foo type=internal` to (re-)create an ovs managed device. And then
`ip` is used to set mac address, mtu, namespace for the device.

Current usage of `ip` commands requires the created device to not
belong to any namespace. This cannot be guaranteed if the device
is already in a wrong or deleted namespace before the `ovs-vsctl`
command. `ovs-vsctl` can delete devices managed by ovs even if the
device is in a deleted namespace but it will ignore the delete
operation if `del-port`, `add-port`, `set ... type=internal` are
put together, in one command transaction.

This patch moves out the del-port part from the long `ovs-vsctl`
command, making del-port a single command transaction. Therefore,
ovs will not ignore the delete operation and the new device
created won't belong to any namespace and following `ip` commands
won't complain about ""device not found"".

Create one vm and then detach the port of this vm immediately
may cause the port in BUILD status forever.

Be notice that the bug is hard to reproduce because it depends
on the indeed handling sequence.

We must review the port create/attach/detach sequence to solve
the problem.

In the sequences descripted bellow,the bug happens:

1, create one vm,so nova-compute notifies neutron using the
""create_port"" api, and nova-compute create one port in ovs.
2, neutron-server creates the related detail information in
the db.
3.1, neutron-openvswitch-agent awares the creation of the port
by loop function and starts to handle the ""port_add"" event.
It gets the details of the port from neutron-server correctly
in the ""treat_devices_added_or_updated"" function,
but the function ""get_vif_port_by_id"" has not been called.
4, at this time,detach the interface of the vm and nova-compute
will delete the port from the ovs
3.2 then ""get_vif_port_by_id"" continues, it finds the vif not
exists and skips update_device_down/update_device_up rpc handling

5, then the port will be left in BUILD and will can not be
operated by end-users forever.

In 3.2 if the port not exists, call update_device_down to notify
the neutron-server set the port status to DOWN. This makes the
port can be attached to vm again.And even the port is attached
to one vm again in no time after detached, the neutron-ovs-agent
can handle the port-add event in next loop cycle,so it is safe
enough.

This patch eliminates the effectively nop operations of update_router and
delete_router of L3RouterApplianceDBMixin.

When update_router, o_r aren't used later, so
_add_type_and_hosting_device_info(o_r) is effectively nop.
When delete_router, the result of _add_type_and_hosting_device_info()
is used as router['hosting_info']. which equals to r_hd_binding.hosting_device.
unschedule_router_from_hosting_device method itself checks if
hosting_device is None, so the caller doesn't need to check it explicitly.

When associating a floating IP with an internal address we look for a
router that is connected to the external network (from which the
floating IP is allocated) and to the internal network on which the
internal address is found.

The current code considers only internal networks that are directly
connected to the router. It does not take into account routes that are
configured on the router via the extraroute extension, that is, it does
not allow associating a floating IP with networks that are reachable by
hopping over devices that connect networks.

Given an internal address with which we would like to associate a
floating IP, the fix also considers routers with extra routes where
all of the following conditions are met:
- The router belongs to the same tenant as the port of the internal
  address.
- The internal address matches one of the router routes.
- The router is attached to the floating IP external network.
- The internal address network is (possibly indirectly) connected to
  the router.

The router with the most specific route will be used.

When _try_generate_ip is executed, a lock is obtained on an inner join select
statement over ipavailabilityranges and ipallocationpools tables. If there
are no available ranges any more a _rebuild_availability_ranges is executed
in order to rebuild the available ranges from the currently allocated ips.
_rebuild_availability_ranges will read the current ipallocations and insert
new records in the ipavailabilityranges table. If there are multiple threads
executing this code (_try_generate_ip and _rebuild_availability_ranges) at the
same time, the lock obtained during _try_generate_ip should prevent
them of calling _rebuild_availability_ranges simultaneously. After the first
thread finishes updating the available ranges it will release the lock and the
second thread will be able to get a new available IP.

In DB2 and PostgreSQL there is an issue with the initial select and the lock is
not obtained in the case when there are no ipavailabilityranges for the current
subnet. This is happening because the returned join statement will not generate
any return rows and the DB will not create a lock at all. This leads to
concurrent _rebuild_availability_ranges executed. _rebuild_availability_ranges
will obtain a lock over ipallocations and this will prevent the two threads of
trying to generate same result but when the first thread finishes it will
release this lock and the second thread will continue to rebuild the ranges
which will lead to a duplicate entry or in some cases to multiple overlapping
entries in the ip available ranges table. The second situation could be a
bigger issue because it will not show any signs of a problem at the time (no
exceptions from the database) but later after continuing allocating IPs the
two records will reach same value for the first_ip which will lead to
_try_generate_ip not able to generate any IPs any more and port_create will
stop working for this subnet.

The fix proposed here is to split the initial join into two separate join
statements. First lock on ipallocationpools and after that try to lock on
ipavailabilityranges. This situation should work as there should be always
records for ipallocationpools and the lock will always work in this part
of the code.

This patch adds a migration for setting a foreign key constraint
between the 'networkgatewaydevicereferences' and
'networkgatewaydevices' tables.

As a result, there is no more need to run an explicit query for
checking whether a gateway device is in use when deleting a
network gateway.

This patch also leverages the newly added constraint for
simplifying device checks on network gateway creation.

This patch removes the logic for creating chained local switches in
the NSX backend for Neutron networks with flat or vlan bindings.
Switch chaining as a feature is no more useful since the underlying
backend limitation has been long removed.

The logic for reading chained logical switches is however
preserved by this patch, since some older neutron networks could
still be mapped to chained logical switches.

When instance vm is used as neutron l3 router,

However guest OS doesn't always support hot-plug/unplug. In order to
support such OS as routervm, allow such VM to boot with vnics
attached, but those ports aren't connected to any tenant networks.
Later when add/remove-router-interface is issued, plug/unplug those

Neutron supports a set of DNSes, Gateway, CIDR, IP Version, and some other key
elements. One key element that is missing is the domain name.

Currently, the domain name gets set by the DHCP server and is set across the
entire cloud (typically set the by dhcp_agent.ini attribute dhcp_domain).
Clouds will typically support many domains, perhaps separated physical
networks, subdividing existing domains, or many other reasons.

By providing this attribute as part of the Network object in Neutron, clients
gain the flexibility to further subdivide their network and gain greater
control of their infrastructure.

We propose to extend Neutron's DHCP agent code so that it works when
data to/from VMs is being routed by the immediate compute host instead
of being bridged. The routed approach enables various alternative
approaches to providing connectivity between VMs - particularly in
deployments where those VMs only require services at layer 3 (IP) and
above - and it is still possible to implement, through iptables and
route distribution filters, all of the detailed connectivity and
security policies that are implied by any given set of OpenStack's
networking, security group and router configurations.

This spec offers and  alternative to the current OpenStack implementation
of DHCP utilizing dnsmasq(http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html),
this spec is proposing an alternative. Others have proposed alternatives
generally drivin from their desire to support their customers in Openstack
implementation. Rather than these customers having to support muliple
versions of DHCP within their environments, the support of alternative
DHCP choices seem the most plausible. The current apporach is using a
dnsmasq server managing each subnet, whereas alternative approachs
utilize a centralized server with the use of relays to forward DHCP
requests to/from that server. We propose that an additional DHCP
driver be provided such that operators can options as to operational
DHCP, such as Cisco’s DHCP product: Cisco Prime Network Registrar (CPNR).

The project/tenant is only stored with the user when using
the sql (default) backend.  This means calls like user list
and user show will not show the default project.  For getting
the project/tenant, if it is not present in the instances
information provided by user list --long, we don't actually
get the project/tenant, we just check to see if the user is
assigned to the given tenant/project.  For setting the
project/tenant, this is usually done with user create, but when
ldap is read-only, we have to use role add to add the user to a
default _member_ role and at the same time assign the user to a
given project/tenant.  This also adds support for using the
openstack $obj show commands which return --format shell output,
and return a hash of key/value pairs.

swift-object-replicator lets you specify --devices and --partitions to
perform a single replication pass over just those devices and
partitions. However, it still scans every device and every partition
to build up a list of jobs to do, then throws away the jobs for the
wrong devices and partitions. This isn't too bad with partitions since
it only wastes some CPU, but with devices, it results in unnecessary
disk IO.

This commit pushes the device and partition filtering a little further
down into collect_jobs to avoid wasted work.

Currently no check for error output on stderr is made, and no
sanity checked performed on the stdout string - both yaml and json
versions could be empty and the test would still pass.

So add sanity assertions for each case so the test is a bit more
robust.

Currently test_cli fails if you don't run it from the repository
top directory, so instead derive a relative path from the test,
which e.g allows you to do nosetests -svx test_cli.py which can
be more convenient when debugging.

This is driven by a few things. Firstly we currently cannot run
our tests except by installing oslo.db after each edit, which impedes
developers by making things slow, and confusing (forget to install,
and you test the last installed code).

Secondly, we cannot use unittest discovery as we do throughout the
rest of OpenStack because it detects that the wrong module is
loaded (that is, the installed one, not the local one) and throws
an error.

Thirdly, we can't rearrange the source tree to be in compliance with
the standard layout for OpenStack (project/tests/...) which means
our test ids are not namespaced today, and so we can't tell what
project a given test result is from without trying to map actual
test functions - which is much harder.

Fourth, due to pip issue #3, we cannot pip install -e packages that
are namespaced using the pkg_resources namespace implementation.

The PEP-420 implementation uses a blank namespace directory with no
__init__.py. However that requires a minimum python version greater
than our supported minimum of 2.6/2.7. importlib2 could help but isn't
ready yet (and we'd still need some magic on installed systems to
activate it). An alternative, which this implementation has chosen, is
to install using the PEP-420 layout (no __init__ in the namespace
package), but simultaneously depend on a package to provide a
__init__.py (the olso package). When we can hard depend on PEP-420 we
can delete that common package. To let developers work locally we need
the local namespace directory to be on the path, so it needs an
__init__.py, and we also need the site-packages namespace directory to
be on the path, so we put a thunk to do that into the local
__init__.py and filter that __init__.py out from installation using
MANIFEST.in.

The owners of maven.research.rackspacecloud.com/ seem to have introduced
a 301 redirect permanent from http -> https URLs on around Jan 10th.
This has broken the master/trove check builds since that time.

Maven, when running in the infrastructure CI environment, fails to
follow these redirects.

This code change simply refers to the maven software repositories using
https URLs.

Local testing of this change against Tesora's downstream CI found that
it may be necessary to purge the broken/cached file from the bare-trusty
CI build machines ala:
rm /home/jenkins/.m2/repository/com/rackspace/cloud/api/wadl-tools/1.0.9
(continued..) /wadl-tools-1.0.9.jar

The owners of maven.research.rackspacecloud.com/ seem to have introduced
a 301 redirect permanent from http -> https URLs on around Jan 10th.
This has broken the master/trove check builds since that time.

Maven, when running in the infrastructure CI environment, fails to
follow these redirects.

This code change simply refers to the maven software repositories using
https URLs.

Local testing of this change against Tesora's downstream CI found that
it may be necessary to purge the broken/cached file from the bare-trusty
CI build machines ala:
rm /home/jenkins/.m2/repository/com/rackspace/cloud/api/wadl-tools/1.0.9

In Icehouse with ""iscsi_use_multipath=true"", attaching a multipath
iSCSI volume may create unnecessary iSCSI sessions.

The iscsiadm discovery command in connect_volume() returns all of the
targets in the Cinder node, not just the ones related to the multipath
volume which is specified by iqn. If the storage has many targets,
connecting to all these volumes will also result in many unnecessary
connections.

There are two types of iSCSI multipath devices. One which shares
the same iqn between multiple portals, and the other which use
different iqns on different portals. connect_volume() needs to
identify the type by checking iscsiadm the output if the iqn is
used by multiple portals.

This patch changes the behavior of attaching volume:

   1. Identify the type by checking the iscsiadm output.
   2. Connect to the correct targets by connect_to_iscsi_portal().

To make it easier to create a bunch of threads in a single
call (and stop them in a single call) create a concept of
a thread bundle (similar to a thread group) that will call
into a provided set of factories to get a thread, activate
callbacks to notify others that a thread is about to start
or stop and then perform the start or stop of the bound
threads in a orderly manner.

Some users (TripleO specifically) want to disable features via a
count of zero, which is a problem as we always recurse and validate
the nested stack since c31c34f8dfd0919bf46a975701c139073115debc

Instead, we only do validation when the count is non-zero, to
enable, e.g default image names, to be ignored at validation
time (as we'll never use them) instead of rejected by the nested
schema (e.g the server.py properties schema which contains a
custom contraint to always validate the image).

This should still allow us to fail fast (at validation time before
creating anything) when we're actually about to create something,
e.g when the count is non-zero.

This patch also rolls in the fix for the regression this originally
caused on master, Iea454f4201990f65633b644bbefe708e5a216885.

Currently object deletion synchronizing was done via a DELETE request
in SimpleClient. If the container was using a non_zero storage policy,
object-server would not find the objects to be deleted since the storage
policy index value in the request header was set to 0 defaultly. This
results the remote objects still exits after synchronizing done.

This patch sets the correct header of the DELETE request with right
storage policy index, so the remote object-server would delete the
objects.

let's add a generic retry decorator class that can be
initialized and used as needed.

This patch leverages the retrying library that's already
in OpenStack Requirements and used in other places.  We
just add a wrapper around it for some logging and add
a bit of error handling incase somebody sets retries to 0

strongSwan doesn't support namespace natively, this wrapper
will use ""mount --bind"" to simulate the ns like this:

sudo neutron-rootwrap /etc/neutron/rootwrap.conf ip netns \
exec <namespace-id> neutron-netns-wrapper --mount_paths \
=/etc:/var/lib/neutron/vpnaas/<xxxx-id>/etc, \
/var/run:/var/lib/neutron/vpnaas/<xxxx-id>/var/run \
--cmd=ipsec,status

Both sudoers and rootwrap.conf will not exist in the
directory /etc after bind-mount, thus we can't use
utils.execute(cmd, conf.root_helper) in
neutron/agent/linux/utils.py. so implement a function
execte(cmd) in this wrapper as an alternative. then we can
use root_helper to invoke this wrapper to make sure all
commands are still running as root as below code shows.
Finally, also need to check in wrapper if cmd matches
CommandFilter based on the same reason.
ip_wrapper = ip_lib.IPWrapper(root_helper, namespace)
    ip_wrapper.netns.execute(
    [NS_WRAPPER,
    '--mount_paths=/etc:%s/etc,/var/run:%s/var/run' % (
    self.config_dir, self.config_dir),
    '--cmd=%s' % ','.join(cmd)],
    check_exit_code=check_exit_code)

We are using check of net namespace (since linux 3.0),
instead of mount namespace (since Linux 3.8), as older
kernels do not support mount namespace. In addition,
mount --bind has been available since Linux 2.4. so we
don't need to worry kilo's minumum kernel requirement.

This patch is based on patchset67 of nachi's initial
vpnaas implementation, many thanks to nachi.

The get_available_resource method returns a dict with a number
of keys that are supposed to be common to all virt drivers.
There are a numer of places where the ironic driver is filling
in non-standard keys.

 - 'disk_total' and 'disk_used' contain identical info
   to the 'local_gb' and 'local_gb_used' fields

 - 'disk_available' mis-named should be 'disk_available_least'

 - 'host_memory_total' and 'host_memory_free' contain
   identical info to the 'memory_mb' and 'memory_mb_used' fields

 - 'node' - contains a UUID

 - 'host' contains a hostname

Further, every key in the 'stats' dict is also duplicated
at the top level dict too.

The resource_tracker.py update_available_resource method
which calls get_available_resource() will not process any
of these non-standard keys.

Simply delete them all, except 'disk_available' which is
renamed to 'disk_available_least'

When reporting the 'cpu_info' field in the get_available_resource

the canonical architecture names. Switch to use the compute.arch
constants.

Although this changes the data reported by hyperv, it should not
have a functional impact since only the libvirt driver is relying
on the precise format of this data. For hyperv it is merely
informational.

The 'cpu_info' field in the dict from get_available_resource
is supposed to provide information on the physical CPU model

raw 'host_cpu_info' dict it got back from XenSever. This

provided.

This commit updates it to convert the data into a format

The rhel-common element has a script that uses subscription-manager
to register an instance of RHEL with the customer portal or Satellite.
If os-refresh-config runs this script more than once,
subscription-manager returns a non-zero value causing os-refresh-config
to fail.  Adding --force to the subscription-manager calls doesn't
properly unregister the image from Satellite and the result is multiple
content host registrations. This patch changes the registration to only
run once.

This change adds a graceful shutdown arugment to the Service.stop
method in order to allow a service to gracefully wait for threads to
shutdown. Since threadgroup already supports a graceful shutdown
argument for its stop() method, it is trivial to support.

Added unit tests to demonstrate the expected behavior between graceful
and ungraceful service stop()s.

Runtime router variable dist_fip_count has been
used to keep track of FIPs for DVR routers.
This variable is not re-initialized correctly on
agent restart and can get stale from other errors
which cause problems with namespace and port cleanup.

This patch will initialize the ri.dist_fip_count
once in process_router for dvr routers only.  This
method was selected instead of the _router_added or
_router_removed path because it is the one central
entry point for rotuer add, delete, and update.

The object self.agent_gateway_port also needs to be
properly handled after an agent restart and this
patch will handle that as well.

When needed, the system will be read via system
calls to determine the state of namespaces and ports
since the variables cannot be relied on.
System calls will be kept to a minimum to reduce
and possible performance hits.

HA standby routers must never transmit traffic from
any of their ports. This is because we allocate the same
port on all agents. For example, for a given external interface,
we place the same port with the same IP/MAC on every agent
the HA router is scheduled on. Thus, if a standby router
transmits data out of that interface, the physical switches
in the datacenter will re-learn the MAC address of the external
port, and place it on a port that's looking at a standby and
not at the master. This causes 100% packet loss for any incoming
traffic that should be going through the master instance of the
router.

Keepalived manages addresses on the router interfaces, and makes
sure that these addresses only live on the master. However, we
forgot about IPv6 link local addresses. They are generated
from the MAC address of the interface, and thus are identical on
all agents.

This patch tries to treat IPv6 link local addresses the same
as IPv4 addresses - define them as VIPs and let keepalived
move them around.

Currently built-in template for AWS LoadBalancer demands
Fedora20 cloud image.
This image has SELinux enabled by default, breaking haproxy functionality.

This patch makes the following changes:

- the built-in default AWS LoadBalancer template now demands
  Fedora 21 x86_64 cloud image (it has more recent and friendly
  packages for selinux-policies);
- enables haproxy to bind to any port;
- deals with selinux and non-default haproxy stats file location
  expected by heat-cfntools;
- adds a doctring to AWS LoadBalancer resource class explaining
  expected features of image and template to successfully use it.

Prior to the code changes to use fsm, when a node's provision state
was set to DEPLOYFAIL, its target_provision_state was set to NOSTATE.
These operations could be performed on these failed nodes:
- PUT /v1/nodes/(node_uuid)/states/provision, with target being one
  of [DELETE, ACTIVE, REBUILD]
- PATCH /v1/nodes

After those code changes, the node's target_provision_state was set
to ACTIVE (in line with the new state machine proposal) and the
above operations were no longer possible.

With these changes (to check for nodes in DEPLOYFAIL provision state),
the above operations can now be performed.
