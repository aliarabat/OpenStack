This patch adds a new configure_safe_defaults function that
is called on EXIT. If the exit code is non-zero the function
executes code to configure DHCP on all active interfaces.

Since DHCP is used to initially bootstrap all TripleO instances
via the provisioning network this should always be a safe default
and allow communication with Heat to persist if an invalid
(breaking) network configuration change is pushed out. This would
facilitate immediate Heat notification of the failure and subsequent
Heat updates to potentially help correct the invalid network
configuration.

To cooperate with blocking calls, which can't be monkey-patched,
eventlet provides support for wrapping those into native OS threads
by the means of eventlet.tpool module. E.g. nova-compute uses it
extensively to make sure calls to libvirt does not block the whole
process.

When used in unit tests, eventlet.tpool creates a pool of 20 native
OS threads per test running process (assuming there was at least one
unit test to actually execute this part of the code in this process).

In unit tests all blocking calls (like calls to libvirt) are
monkey-patched anyway, so there is little sense to wrap those by the
means of tpool.execute() (as we don't want to test eventlet either).
Monkey-patching of tpool.execute(), on the other hand, allows not to
create pools of native OS threads per test running process, and thus
to avoid the overhead (syscalls, stacks allocation, etc).

The performance gain depends on the number of test running processes,
but is almost negligible, though. So it's mostly about 'why I see
320 python threads in htop when running nova unit tests?'.

this functionality is 'enable_docker_registry'.

Manila microversions have following template:

x.y

where 'x' and 'y' both digits.

And now tempest transforms string 'x.y' to float but it is incorrect
thing to do because float assumes that each left value is bigger than
right one. And it is not suitable for microversion comparisons.

Examples:

Microversions true conditions:
2.9 < 2.10
2.9 < 2.81

Float true conditions:
2.9 > 2.10
2.9 > 2.81

So, create new file 'manila_tempest_tests/utils.py' and place there
old and new functions that serve all microversion actions. In addition,
port another existing utility function called 'rand_ip'.

We mostly do node scheduling based on profile, which means that the
actual values in the flavors don't matter in many cases. To make
the entire deploy process easier, just create the default flavors
with some sane minimum specs.  They can always be changed later
for users who want to do something different.

As part of this change, the post deploy code in undercloud.py was
refactored to be a bit more modular and easier to test.

to do the pki (via ssh) or endpoints (via http) setup, that is the

This change adds a new *_from_pool.yaml meant to return an IP from
a list instead of allocating a Neutron port, useful to pick an IP
from a pre-defined list and making it possible to configure, for
example an external balancer in advance (or dns), with the future
IPs of the controller nodes.

The list of IPs is provided via parameter_defaults (in the
ControllerIPs struct) using ControllerIPs param.

Also some additional VipPort types are created for the *VirtualIP
resources. The VIPs were previously created using the same port
resource used by the nodes, but when deploying with an external
balancer we want the VIP resource to be nooped instead.

NFS: 3PAR NFS shares can only be ro or rw, so create 2 shares
that both point to the same destination with the same export location.
This appears as one share in Manila. Create the RW share when the
share is first created (to make sure it is create-able) and add the
RO version when needed to support an RO access rule.

CIFS: For user access, this is easy. Just set read instead of fullcontrol.
Since 3PAR cannot do read-only at the CIFS IP level and also since most Manila
drivers do not use IP access on CIFS, take out the default requirement
of IP access for CIFS. Add a config setting to allow the old behavior to
be used if needed.

2. Doc strings for many methods were changed to keep consistency with help

3. Missing doc string were added.

In addition, the 'start' method in verify.py was slightly refactored.
Also InvalidArgumentsException was replaced by the print() function
because it is recommended to use print() in CLI module.

Now arguments of the 'verify' method in api.py have the default values to
keep consistency with other methods.

The existing neutron-large-ops spawns multiple VMs at the same time,
which results in GET requests being flooded to the server.

However, this is done without vNICs, without exercising the Neutron
backends, and without any pre-existing resource load. For this reason,
this job does not quite pounds Neutron hard enough, and the chance of
breaking it with Neutron patches ends up being practically nil. Chances
are that a potential regression is caught by some other job, like Rally.

This change proposes to demote the job to the experimental queue
for Neutron, ideally to be replaced by a job that can more effectively
put strain on the server, and under different circumnstances (for
instance with prepolated load). The job should be fine at catching
regressions induced by how a client calls Neutron, and for this
reason, it's left on the large-ops for Nova and the other projects.

For now, let's free up a slot for something else.

We need to test keystone running under eventlet until we can get rid
of it, but that doesn't mean that every project needs to test
keystone running under eventlet since a change in other projects
can't break keystone. Only keystone needs to run this job.

Eventually this will allow changing the gate to run the
shared jobs in a consistent configuration and it will be easier
to debug gate issues.

I copy-pasted the job template for
'{pipeline}-tempest-dsvm-nova-wsgi-full{branch-designator}' and
switched USE_MOD_WSGI to KEYSTONE instead.

The job should be gating on all branches. Keystone has had eventlet
support in all supported branches. We've been gating on it in the
postgres job since that was switched to use eventlet.

When keepalived crashed unexpectedly, the vrrp process that
it associates with will be orphan process. This will make
the VIP unable to migrate to the router in the same host.
Also, neutron code is not able to respawn the keepalived
process, because keepalived thinks itself is still running,
according to [1-3]. As a result, neutron will report respawning
keepalived all the time. Restart l3-agent will not help.

This patch will check and delete the orphan vrrp process
if there is any, in the processmonitor of l3 agent.

The fernet payload tests assumed that the timestamp string that
was put into the payload would be exactly the same as the timestamp
string resulting from parsing the payload, but this isn't the case
since the timestamp string goes through a conversion to float and
back and a tiny amount of precision may be lost.

The tests are changed to allow a tiny difference in timestamp
strings.

This was causing python3.4 unit tests to fail sometimes.

I consistently have problems building images on an 8 GB VM with
the undercloud already installed (which is the documented flow).
At 4 or 12 GB it works fine, but 8 seems to fall in a sweet spot
where the tmpfs usage of dib causes OOM problems.  4 GB works
because dib doesn't use tmpfs by default with that little memory,
and 12 GB seems to be sufficient to avoid running out of memory
even with tmpfs.

This changes passes the --min-tmpfs 5 parameter to the image build
for the overcloud-full image (the largest image by far) so it will
not attempt to build in tmpfs if there is less than 12 GB of RAM.
5 instead of 6 because due to rounding 6 would result in tmpfs not
being used on 12 GB VMs either (similar to how it is not used on a
4 GB VM even though the default is 2).

Note that tmpfs by default uses half of total memory, which is why
all of the min-tmpfs numbers are half of the expected memory on the
system.

list currently installed on our workers. Also switch the
install-distro-packages builder to use the
install-distro-packages.sh script installed on worker images rather
than baking that logic into the job configuration, and add a new
install-distro-packages-fallback-test builder to do the logical
overrides needed for the two new fallback-file-specific jobs.

- Method `webob.multidict.MultiDict.items` returns list object in py2 env[1]

  headers in a loop(changes of item's order prevent skipping some headers).

  py3 env. Good example is `test_resource_headers_are_utf8` test. Int value 1
  became to b'b""b\'1\'""' after deserialization.
- Wrong checks for utf-8. (including check for encoding headers names, which
  is not encoded anywhere in the code)
- Wrong checks for `body` property of `webob.response.Response` cls. Method
  `_body__get` returns bytes[3]. There is no problem in python 2, since
  type(b""some"") equals to type(""some""), but it wrong for python 3.

Client tests are broadly seperated into v2 and v3. These folders don't
distinguish between the tests that are on v2/v3 auth and those that are
CRUD related. This means that the base v2 and v3 test class always
create a client object for the tests to use, even if they don't need it.

Whilst this isn't a big deal now, we want to be able to seperate only
those tests that require a client so we can test them with multiple
different styles of client.

A net-list operation was calling extend_network_dict_provider for
each network individually which would result in a database call for
each network.

This adds a new call in the manager to extend multiple networks at
once and then it adds a bulk version of get_network_segments that
it calls.

Now 1 net list of any number of networks will only result in 1
segment DB call.

return a 403 on a *LO GET when accessed by requests using referer

Currently the only way around referer access to *LO's is to make the

This change makes sure the referer header is passed into subrequests

Remove SQLite BigInteger/Integer translation logic

This patch removes code that was causing the
SQLAlchemy BigInteger type to render as INTEGER
on the SQLite backend only.  The comment
in create_shadow_table() in nova/db/sqlalchemy/utils.py
which states that BigInteger isn't supported by SQLite
is not correct.  SQLite has an ""affinity""-based,
dynamic typing model [1] that allows virtually any
name to be used for a type; datatypes are actually
determined on a row-by-row basis, but any
type name that has the substring INT inside of it
is automatically given integer affinity by default,
so there is no limitation on this type.

There is one difference on SQLite between INTEGER
and BIGINT, and that is that SQLite's ""rowid""
feature only takes effect for a primary key column
if it is named ""INTEGER PRIMARY KEY"" [2].  However,
as all tests pass here it does not seem to be the
case that we are using BigInteger primary keys
in tests, and if we were, I'd rather approach SQLite's
quirk here in a different way.

Note that this patch relies upon the assumption
that **SQLite is only used in Nova as a test database,
not in actual deployments**.  If this statement is
not true, then information on these other use cases
will be needed.

Due to Alembic issue #341 [3] which has been resolved
for version 0.8.4 [4], the comparison of
INTEGER/BIGINT/SMALLINT is now significant by default,
so this change (or alternatively, one that changes Nova's
type comparison rules within migration tests) is needed
in order for Nova to pass the test_migrations test; the
error condition that raises with the latest Alembic is
shown in [5].

This introduces a base live migration data object and makes compute
manager convert any migrate data objects received from the driver
back to dicts. This is transitional as we build support for using
these objects, as well as infrastructure around handling the
conversion to them over the next RPC major version.

The goal here will be to unify all of the random dicts that we pass
around between live migration steps with one type of object (which
will be subclassed per driver). Right now, we have dest_check_data,
migrate_data, and pre_live_migration_result which are all weird
semi-overlapping versions of each other. But, in order to this in
a graceful way, we need to support generating the old dict format,
which is even weirder when it comes from something uniform. Hang on,
it's going to be a bumpy ride, but better in the long run.

In this patch, we're setting the stage for per-driver conversions to
come afterwards. This converts the hyperv driver in-place, because
it's trivial.

layout code's point of view, export_location is an arbitrary
opaque value, obtained from self.driver._setup_via_manager with

That we use export_location as dict key in ensure_share is just
a pre-layout relict that survived by the virtue of remaining

This's a regression issue introduced by

I4f2f2f240404b2619ba0ee75a99fecd0ad10040e

Though we support lazy creation for queue, but it doesn't make
sense there's no result after creating the queue explicitly from cli.
So this patch introduces a new parameter named force_create to make
sure make sure the queue create is called each time when it's called
from command line interface.

Cinder API was pinned to v1 due to openstackclient missing some of the
v2 commands, as reported in osc bug 1475060. That bug has since been
marked invalid, but its intent was covered by the blueprint:

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/python-openstackclient/+spec/volume-v2

This removes the pinning to the v1 API now that osc supports v2. Also
removing the enablement of v1 as it was deprecated three releases ago
and we would like to get more coverage on v2.

Similar to the directives inside
openstack_dashboard/static/app/core/cloud-services, we want to remove
particular HTML content if not supported by the api version.

For example, we only want to show the users magic search if v3 is
enabled because only v3 supports the filtering.  Or we want to show
the Domain ID/Name on the Create Users modal if v3 is enabled.

You can do simple comparison checks, e.g. keystone version > 2
or glance <= 2 and chain together multiple checks.

When we use 'qemu-img info' command to get image info, some kinds
of image may show an 'unavailable' disk size. For example:

$qemu-img info sheepdog:volume-1af1afa0-7820-4063-9b90-4fa6161a74a9

disk size: unavailable

The current code didn't consider 'unavailable' size, and it will
raise a ValueError in this case. This patch fixed this bug by
adding the judgment of 'unavailable' size.

Gerrit 2.11 no longer seems to support the sortKey method of
skipping changes.  Instead is provides a --start option that takes
a number of changes to skip.

See: https://review.openstack.org/Documentation/cmd-query.html

In addition, this required a change to the format of the changes
dict.  It turns out we were overwriting some changes if two had the
same id.  This is common in stable branch cherry picks.

In order to avoid this, I used a tuple of id, project, branch
as the key for the changes dict.  This does break compatibility
with existing cache files, so a check was added to clear old
caches.

Both of these changes were required together because otherwise we
end up with a smaller number of items in changes than we should
have, and the --start argument is incorrect so we start double
processing changes, which breaks the loop because it looks like
the change was already cached.

this updates the tests to skip if the config values are not set.

The host parameter type is a nullable variant of the standard hostname
type. However, we're declaring the type twice in this schema for no
reason. Looks like it was just an error when dealing with this patch

Change Ib60d60a5af35be89ad8afbcf44fcffe0b0ce2876 meant
to address a race in deleting an instance while booting from
volume such that the BDMs passed to terminate_instance from
the API were stale (no volume_id set yet in the database).

Without the volume_id, _shutdown_instance can't detach the
volumes and _cleanup_volumes can't delete them.

The change fixed the race in _shutdown_instance by refreshing
the BDM list if necessary, but it didn't fix the problem of
deleting the volumes in _cleanup_volumes, which is still
getting a stale list of BDMs from the compute API.

This moves the refresh BDM logic to the top-level method
terminate_instance so that the refreshed BDMs are passed
to both _shutdown_instance and _cleanup_volumes.

There is some cleanup that can be done with
_delete_instance but since we'd like to backport this change
and the previous one, the cleanup is left for a later patch.

than of the glance MD5 ""checksum"" hash of the image

This spec updates the prior approved and implemented
Liberty spec with these modifications.

In an effort to widen support for resource properties that are IDs but
can take the appropriate resource type for that ID, the block_store
service throws a kink into it. The Volume type can contain a Snapshot,
and a Snapshot can contain a Volume. Because of that loop, we can't do
the usual `foo = resource.prop(foo, FooType)`. We can sort of emulate
the behavior users will get out of it in the proxy by doing a type
conversion in the create_volume and create_snapshot methods to support
resource instances being passed in there.

Additionally, Volume can be created from another Volume, but we can't
have a prop refer to its own class, so that problem is solved the same
as above.

Lastly, the Volume resource has two props that can take real types:
image and type.

neutron-server-start-wait-stop is a dangerous Exec that is exposed to
race conditions, because it does not have ""onlyif"" or ""unless""
statements.

That means during a deployment, this exec can be run in the wrong order
during Step 5 and/or 6, while it was supposed to be run at Step 4 only.
If that happens, the exec will fail because puppet tries to start
neutron-server while Pacemaker already started the resource. So in that
case, systemd would returns 1 to Puppet which would return 6 to the
overcloud deployment and the deployment would fail to finish correctly.

This patch aims to prevent from this scenario by making sure we run the
exec only during the step 4.

Also, in order to secure it a bit more, we add 'unless' statement to
this exec, so we would make sure the Puppet run would be idempotent and
the Exec would run one successful time only.

Flavor classes are defined by setting the 'class' key on a flavor's

Cells can announce that they only support certain flavor classes by setting
the 'capabilities' nova.conf option under the [cells] config section.  The
value of this option should be 'flavor_classes=name1;name2;name3' to
advertise that they support flavor classes 'name1', 'name2', and 'name3'.

Imagine this configuration:

flavor #1 extra_specs['class'] = 'highio'
flavor #2 extra_specs['class'] = 'standard'

Cell #1 nova.conf:

------- 8< -------

Note the capabilities syntax:
 * '=' to match each key=val pair in a single capability
 * ','  to separate capabilities
 * ';' to separate the list of capability values

With this filter, building flavor #1 will go to cell1.  Flavor #2 will go

volumes.

This puts the volume connection info in the instance metadata, where the

also need to manually unmount the volume to avoid potential data
corruption when the server is powered off.

This also adds a cells RPC call for updating instance metadata in the

Ironic needs to do late-binding of ports, as it will need to update the
port object with more information necessary for doing the actual
binding, such as switchport etc. It also doesn't want to give the
machine access to the tenant networks during provisioning, and so won't
bind the port until provisioning is complete.

We have done wrapper and lib for installing nosql databases
(hbase for now) they can be executed via enable_serivce hbase
in localrc.

HBase and Cassandra are supported as database backends in
Ceilometer, MagnetoDB projects, and it can be useful for
development and gating to have it in devstack.

We have implemented Cassandra as part of MagnetoDB devstack integration (
https://github.com/stackforge/magnetodb/tree/master/contrib/devstack) and
started working on HBase now

Here are several blueprints on this occasion
- MagnetoDB
  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/magnetodb/+spec/database-plugin-hbase
  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/magnetodb/+spec/devstack-add-hbase
- Ceilometer
  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/hbase-tests-on-real-backend

This commit adds the smoke attribute to test_snapshot_pattern scenario
test. This test covers pretty basic functionality around ensuring that
snapshots work. Snapshots are an important feature to verify in a basic
sanity check which is what smoke is useful for.
