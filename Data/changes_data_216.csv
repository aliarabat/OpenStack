Currently, if the iSCSI CIDR filter filters out some portals in
a synchronous replication setup, it only filters out the portals
but leaves the IQNs and LUNs, which can result in a mismatched
set of connection lists. This addresses the issue by filtering
earlier in the process, and only adding ones that pass the filter
in the first place.

Cinder can successfully retype an attached volume from SolidFire

fixes this issue, allowing retype operation for attached volumes from

By merging this changes, we expect that the following change is made

- Remove CentOS7 job in master because we don't support CentOS7 anymore

Previousy, the ServiceManager.config_option() context manager set a
single config option. This was wasteful when more than one config
option needed to be set for a single service, as that service ended up
being restarted as many times as there were config options to set.
This patch changes config_option() to config_options(), which now
accepts a list of (section, option, value) tuples. It'll set all of
them for the service, then restart it just once.

When a majority of replica of an account are reclaimed, a container
cannot report its timestamps. If report is not done, container cannot be
reclaimed.

This patch:
- fixes an issue of account-server where a request from the
  container-updater (containing the header
  X-Account-Override-Deleted: yes) on a non-existant account returns 500
  instead of 404
- makes the container-updater aware of 404 from the account-server so it
  can ask the entire account ring to check if the account exists
  somewhere before deciding to mark the containe reported, giving it a
  chance to be reclaimed later by the container-replicator.

This patch fixes batch member create to retry the database get call
when new members are being created via batch member update.
This issue only impacts the v1 amphora driver as the v2 driver

We've recently started getting Ansible pip error as follows:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'

This happens because we install crudini and iniparse from GitHub
source using Ansible's pip module in our Ansible roles, and Ansible's
pip module needs the system pip to be preconfigured (the exact
details are murkey - why this started happenig now is also a mystery).

This patch fixes that by adding the ensure-pip to our playbook. It
also renamed the plabook to be more consisten with other openstack
projects.

We previously fixed a bunch of places, but not quite *all* the places;
at the very least, some account-layer services (like the replicator and
auditor IIRC) could still bomb out -- and it's important that
replicators still respect fallocate_reserve!

Now, do the NicerInterpolation thing every time we call readconf.
Additionally, clean up the original fix to avoid globally
monkey-patching configparser.

Also, use grenade instead of grenade-py3. The former is now used

Reverting this ps since we tried to solve the  problem here for

its v2 port and try to communicate with server and getting some
warnings as shown below:

lets make v2 port as default and ovverride  mon_host config for
old clients prior  to nautilus as we did in this ps
(https://review.opendev.org/#/c/711648/).

better solution will be moving out of old ceph clients by changing
the images wherever old ceph clients are installed.

OVS tag v2.13.0 is not compatible with current used kernel on upstream
Bionic Ubuntu kernel 4.15.0. This patch sticks to commit hash to unblock
the gate. We can either change to newer 2.13 tag once released or better
stop compiling OVS and use one packaged by Ubuntu.

Run functional/fullstack tests with selected OVN and OVS versions

Previously for functional tests OVS version was hardcoded - v2.12.0,
and OVN was installed from OVS repository.

After we merged OVN driver to Neutron tree we run both
Neutron/OVS and Neutron/OVN functional tests in one job.

This patch adds possibility to specify from which tag/branch OVS and OVN
should be checkout.

This patch refactors the failover flows to improve the performance
and reliability of failovers in Octavia.

Specific improvements are:
* More tasks and flows will retry when other OpenStack services are
  failing.
* Failover can now succeed even when all of the amphora are missing
  for a given load balancer.
* It will check and repair the load balancer VIP should the VIP
  port(s) become corrupted in neutron.
* It will cleanup extra resources that may be associated with a
  load balancer in the event of a cloud service failure.

This patch also removes some dead code.

We previously fixed a bunch of places, but not quite *all* the places;
at the very least, some account-layer services (like the replicator and
auditor IIRC) could still bomb out -- and it's important that
replicators still respect fallocate_reserve!

Now, do the NicerInterpolation thing every time we call readconf.

Create a single governance body to represent all contributors
to OpenStack (developers, operators and end users of the software).

The User Committee is defined in the OpenStack Foundation
bylaws, and amending those is very costly (in time, money and
effort). Luckily, the bylaws defer most of the UC details to a
User Committee charter, which contents are modifiable by the
User Committee itself.

This change adds a minimal User Committee charter that implements
the User Committee as a subcommittee of the Technical Committee.
This allows to operate as a single group without requiring costly
bylaws changes to be implemented first.

'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also

We've recently started getting Ansible pip error as follows:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'

This happens because we install crudini and iniparse from GitHub
source using Ansible's pip module in our Ansible roles, and Ansible's
pip module needs the system pip to be preconfigured (the exact
details are murkey - why this started happenig now is also a mystery).

This patch fixes this by moving the installation to our devstack
plugin, and using devstack's `pip_install` function, which does all
the necessary magic. This has the nice side-effect of better local
reproducibility of jobs, as it removes the need for Zuul ansible
roles.

Pioso,richard.pioso,"Fix Redfish handle no continuous override boot src

Some hardware Redfish services have dropped support for continuously
overriding the boot source when the boot mode is Unified Extensible
Firmware Interface (UEFI). See this discussion:
http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-discuss/2020-April/014543.html

A workaround falls back to one-time override, restoring it on every
reboot or power on. [1] However, it does not work, because, per the
Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) Redfish standard, one-time
override is disabled on the next boot cycle. [2] This fixes that by
explicitly setting the boot source override to one-time every time it is
restored.

* Linking from HTML to PDF document
* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_version to not auto-version the documents.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

When upgrading to osa to stein we also require an upgrade of ceph to mimic.

There is a small problem of the mons/mgrs not restarting on packages upgrades
and according to ceph upgrade documentation, you generally want to upgrade
mons before osds, so with `ceph-mimic-upgrades.yml` we upgrade packages and
config on mons/mgrs first, and force a restart of the services.

We also set upgrade_ceph_packages=true to force an upgrade of the packages
during run-upgrade.sh;
  setup-infrastructure.yml (ceph-install.yml)
  setup-openstack.yml (ceph-rgw-install.yml)

When neutron.cmd.destroy_patch_ports has a lot of stuff to do, that may
introduce increased downtime, when restarting neutron ovs agent.

Use newly added pre_stop_exec to call the script *also* before
stopping the neutron ovs agent container. Then, when it will be later
called as the part of usual start-up, there is chances what much
less work TBD for it.

Note: It must be called as well before starting the main agent process,
since there may be corner cases. Like abrupt shutdown of the host.
Leaving the wiring in the DB would cause an arp storm, after the node
is started.

That hopefully works idempotently and reduces the downtime window, when
restarting the container during minor/updates or scale-up actions.

Also align the configdir and logging arguments to be used consistently
with the script and the main agent command invoked in the container.

The recent maas stonith resources, introduced to support stonith
with pacemaker-remotes, included a hash of the combined url and
api key in the resource name. But the charm only supports one
stonith resource (single maas_url api key config options). Having
the hash makes managing the resources more complicated espically
when the url or api key change. So remove any existing resource
(there is very unlikely to be one as the feature is only just
out of preview state) and replace with a single resource called
'st-maas'.

For debian, ubuntu binary setup it is

Reason why it is ""accidentaly"" working is:

For debian package:
Package is overriding STATIC_ROOT in
/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings.d/_0003_debian_static_root.py.
But this is going to be removed from settings in

Ubuntu package is adding patch to package which is including

This patch is fixing this behaviour more clearly.

When the NetApp backend starts, it needs to know whether the
`revert_to_snapshot` support exist. So, it was retrieving the
licenses and checking if the `SnapRestore` is included. Using a
scoped account, the backend cannot retrieve that information,
though. So, this patch solves it by sending a fake operation
`revert_to_snapshot` that must fail. Analyzing the given error, it
sets the backend support field.

Kayobe has a role to disable SELinux. Some systems do not have SELinux
installed (this can be reproduced by removing the selinux-policy package
and removing /etc/selinux/config). This causes the selinux
Ansible module to fail, since it can't write to /etc/selinux/config:

Prevously the container image tag applied to built images was configured
via 'kolla_openstack_release'. This variable also controlled the tag
used for deployed images. This could cause problems during the CentOS 8
transition, where we need to build two sets of images, and Kolla Ansible
may apply a '-centos8' suffix to the tag we specify on CentOS 8.

This change separates the tag applied to built images into a different
variable - 'kolla_tag'. The default is still 'kolla_openstack_release'.

flake8 new release 3.8.0 added new checks and gate pep8

avoid bringing in a new version with new checks.

Though it is fixed in latest hacking but 2.0 and 3.0 has cap for
flake8 as <4.0.0 which mean flake8 new version 3.9.0 can also
break the pep8 job if new check are added.

To avoid similar gate break in future, we need to bump the hacking min

Also removing the hacking and other related dep from lower-constraints file
as theose are blacklisted requirements and does not need to be present

If the nova compute image cache is on the same disk as the instance
directory then the images in the cache will consume the same disk
resource as the nova instances which can lead to disk overallocation.

This patch adds a new config option
[workarounds]/reserve_disk_resource_for_image_cache . If it is set the
libvirt driver will reserve DISK_GB resources in placement for the
actual size of the image cache.

This is a low complexity solution with known limitations:
* Reservation is updated long after the image is downloaded
* This code allows the reservation to push the provider into negative
available resource if the reservation + allocations exceed the total
inventory.

* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

This patch removes OPAE driver package from cyborg-agent dependencies due to
the following reasons:

1. In the kolla cyborg-agent image we install OPAE, but OPAE is not
available for CentOS 8 for the moment. This will make the cyborg-agent image
unbuildable in Ussuri[0].

2. In devstack, due to the fact that OPAE packages depend on libjson0, which
is not available after Ubuntu 16.04, so cyborg can't be installed on Ubuntu
higher than 16.04 now(unless disable dependency manually). Moreover,from
cyborg's perspective, it does not need to contain any hardware driver
dependency, we can assume the admin should know about it and install the
correct version.

3. We had an agreement at Victoria PTG that we should remove.[1]

Fix pep8 job

New flake8 came out with new & improved rules. Ignore E741; it would be
too much churn. Fix the rest.

AWS CLI version 2 improves Amazon S3 handling of file properties

copies with default options.

This way get tagging request will receive an empty tagset in

When you've got a container server that's struggling to respond to HEAD

of the hundreds of concurrent requests trying to repopulate the cache
return 503.

Setup a native Zuul v3 grenade-base job that defines base folders and
base devstack settings. The grenade play checks out repositories
in two locations, old and new, and sets up devstack config
in old and new as well.

Define a grenade job that sets up devstack services.
This job runs:
- devstack from grenade_from_branch (without tempest)
- grenade from grenade_to_branch
- projects in old from grenade_from_branch
and then tries to run grenade and then tempest.
The configure-grenade-branches role sets the base/target
branch variables (grenade_{from,to}_branch) and must be
updated when cutting a new branch.

Also, define the native versions of the grenade-postgresql
and grenade-multinode jobs, replacing non-native jobs
(like neutron-grenade and neutron-grenade-multinode) when possible.
Even though Python 3 is now the default, define grenade-py3
for compatibility reasons.

Finally, define a basic grenade-forward job which should
be used for forward upgrade testing. Forward testing
requires the user to set the destination branch,
and it is relevant for stable branches only, so disable it
from master.

At least for legacy grenade jobs, Zuul seems to be taking care
of Depends-On on the stable branch.

It is worth noting that tls-proxy is set to False as
it happens with the current legacy jobs. It does not
work by just flipping it to true.

This backport includes the subsequent fix to add
the grenade repository to required-projects, see
I3cafdb3bd48e288c2c192893e3898a827ae4552b

Finally, the job definition has been tuned for this stable
branch by remove USE_PYTHON3: true from the base grenade job,
as this grenade upgrade is Python 2-based.

Squashed the below backport also to make it work:
1. virtualenv fix in this to make grenade py2 job pass:

grenade jobs on ussuri is run with train as base branch where
devstack is not default to py3 so grenade jobs run on ussuri gate

Use the zuul-role to ensure the system package that provides

Devstack did the same but grenade jobs are not derived from devstack
job so we need to do it separately.

When the role is used by grenade, the data directory is shared among
different devstack executions, and the base directory is different,
for example: /opt/stack/data vs /opt/stack/{old,new}.
The new devstack_data_base_dir parameter allows user to specify
a base directory for the data/ directory which is unrelated
to the devstack directory. The default value is devstack_base_dir,
so the default behavior is unchanged.

When performing inspection on baremetal compute nodes, inspector
currently has the following failure when storing inspection data to the
introspection store:

    No 'keystoneauth1.plugin' driver found, looking for 'token_endpoint'

This happens because the token_endpoint auth type is no longer
available. The new way to do this is to set auth_type = none and provide
an endpoint override.

We have a hacking check to make sure assertTrue is used instead of
assertEqual(True, something). The regex used for that likely needs to be
fixed as it's overly complex for what it is trying to match.

We are seeing pep8 failures flagging an instance of assertEqual that is
comparing a tuple that happens to contain True as one of its values. As
an easier path to get around this failure until someone can reevaluate
the hacking check regex, this just reformats the test code so that it no
longer gets matched by the existing regex.

When the NetApp backend starts, it needs to know whether the
`revert_to_snapshot` support exist. So, it was retrieving the
licenses and checking if the `SnapRestore` is included. Using a
scoped account, the backend cannot retrieve that information,
though. So, this patch solves it by sending a fake operation
`revert_to_snapshot` that must fail. Analyzing the given error, it
sets the backend support field.

Currently there are conditions that can prevent Bluestore OSDs
from deploying correctly if the disk used was previously deployed
as an OSD in another Ceph cluster. This change fixes the
ceph-volume OSD init script so it can handle these situations
correctly if OSD_FORCE_REPAIR is set.

Additionally, there is a race condition that may occur which
causes logical volumes to not get tagged with all of the
necessary metadata for OSDs to function. This change fixes
that issue as well.

The public network name is set via public_net_name, and its default
value is the first item in the external_net_names list. The variable
uses the YAML folded block scalar notation, but does not use the
chomping indictator, which means the string is assigned a trailing
newline.

This change fixes the issue by adding the chomping indicator.

Haproxy 1.8 brings in a specific change that breaks us:
It removes the haproxy-systemd-wrapper which
we use in order to be able to reload the config file without
restarting the whole container (important in TLS scenarios).

We fix this by calling the haproxy binary directly and
using the master-worker mode (-Ws) which allows to receive
a SIGUSR2 command which will then reload the config for
all the workers. It should also not background.

This commit keeps backward compatibility with current HAProxy
to ease the transition to new HAProxy.

Pioso,richard.pioso,"Fix Redfish handle no continuous override boot src

Some hardware Redfish services have dropped support for continuously
overriding the boot source when the boot mode is Unified Extensible
Firmware Interface (UEFI). See this discussion:
http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-discuss/2020-April/014543.html

A workaround falls back to one-time override, restoring it on every
reboot or power on. [1] However, it does not work, because, per the
Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) Redfish standard, one-time
override is disabled on the next boot cycle. [2] This fixes that by
explicitly setting the boot source override to one-time every time it is
restored.

When performing inspection on baremetal compute nodes, inspector
currently has the following failure when storing inspection data to the
introspection store:

    No 'keystoneauth1.plugin' driver found, looking for 'token_endpoint'

This happens because the token_endpoint auth type is no longer
available. The new way to do this is to set auth_type = none and provide
an endpoint override.

Currently the ordering of network interfaces in the seed VM is
non-deterministic. This happens because we apply the 'unique' filter to
the network_interfaces list, which does not guarantee a deterministic
ordering. This list is then transformed and passed to the
stackhpc.libvirt-vm role.

There are two consequences of this:

* it is not possible to determine which interface names should be used
  prior to creating a seed VM
* if a seed VM is recreated, the interface ordering may change

This change fixes the issue by sorting the network_interfaces list
alphabetically before it is transformed and passed to the
stackhpc.libvirt-vm.

A new 'seed_vm_interfaces' variable is also added, which allows for
customisation of the VM's interfaces - potentially allowing for more
complex setups such as trunked VLANs.

Story: 2007259
Task: 38621

There is a second issue, which is that if the seed VM has a
network interface not configured with a gateway, cloud-init will fail to
configure the network interfaces on the host. This has been observed on
CentOS 8, but is probably more tied to the version of cloud-init, and
may affect CentOS 7. The following error is seen in the cloud-init logs:

    KeyError: 'gateway'

This change has been addressed in the jriguera.configdrive role, and
this change updates the version used in requirements.yml.

Currently the ordering of network interfaces in the seed VM is
non-deterministic. This happens because we apply the 'unique' filter to
the network_interfaces list, which does not guarantee a deterministic
ordering. This list is then transformed and passed to the
stackhpc.libvirt-vm role.

There are two consequences of this:

* it is not possible to determine which interface names should be used
  prior to creating a seed VM
* if a seed VM is recreated, the interface ordering may change

This change fixes the issue by sorting the network_interfaces list
alphabetically before it is transformed and passed to the
stackhpc.libvirt-vm.

A new 'seed_vm_interfaces' variable is also added, which allows for
customisation of the VM's interfaces - potentially allowing for more
complex setups such as trunked VLANs.

Story: 2007259
Task: 38621

There is a second issue, which is that if the seed VM has a
network interface not configured with a gateway, cloud-init will fail to
configure the network interfaces on the host. This has been observed on
CentOS 8, but is probably more tied to the version of cloud-init, and
may affect CentOS 7. The following error is seen in the cloud-init logs:

    KeyError: 'gateway'

This change has been addressed in the jriguera.configdrive role, and
this change updates the version used in requirements.yml.

When GRENADE_USE_EXTERNAL_DEVSTACK is set to True,
the initial steps performed by grenade are skipped, namely:
- grabbing and configuring the base and the target devstacks;
- running devstacks on the base target.

This change is required to allow a native Zuul v3 job to use
the existing workflow to setup and run devstack.

in favor of the new ovs/integration_bridge[1] parameter, so

Also, that parameter is also available in l3 agent configuration, so

is opinionated and does not expose all possible options.

Only the very minimum is provided in this patch. More options
will be added later as we decide they are important.

Using --no-cache-dir flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.

Using ""--no-cache-dir"" flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.
