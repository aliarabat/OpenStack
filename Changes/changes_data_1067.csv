In Icehouse, the nova-scheduler still had a primary responsibility
in orchestrating a VM's deployment and, as such, had access to the
requested_networks via the schedule_run_instance(...) method. In Juno,
we've switched to a model in which the conductor takes over more of
this capability and only invokes the scheduler's select_destination
method.

As a result, the scheduler no longer has any way to determine
which networks are being requested, leaving schedulers unable to
determine which networks the user is requesting at deploy time since
there are no other associations formed at this time.

This patch sends the requested_networks along to the scheduler's
select_destinations() method via filter_props['requested_networks'],
thus allowing schedulers to interrogate this information at VM
initial deploy time.

Presently, the wsgi server allows persist connections hence even after
the response is sent to the client, it doesn't close the client socket
connection.
Because of this problem, the green thread is not released back to the pool.

In order to close the client socket connection explicitly after the
response is sent and read successfully by the client, you simply have to
set keepalive to False when you create a wsgi server.

Add a parameter to take advantage of the new(ish) eventlet socket timeout
behaviour. Allows closing idle client connections after a period of
time, eg:

$ time nc localhost 8776
real    1m0.063s

Setting 'client_socket_timeout = 0' means do not timeout.

Added wsgi_keep_alive option (default=True).
Added client_socket_timeout option (default=900).

With the creation of the new openstack_config provider, some processing
that was done in cinder_config has been centralized in
openstack_config.

Impacted methods are :

  * section
  * setting
  * separator

Also, this commit adds the fact that, when passing a specific string
(ensure_absent_val) the provider will behave as if ensure => absent was
specified. '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' is the default value for
ensure_absent_val.

The use case is the following :

cinder_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => 'bar' } # will work as usual

cinder_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' } # will mean absent

That means that all the current :

if $myvar {
  cinder_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => $myvar }
} else {
  cinder_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : ensure => absent }
}

can be removed in favor of :

cinder_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => $myvar }

If for any reason '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' turns out to be a valid value for

The VLAN provisioning performance can be sped up by querying only for
the CNAs of the VM that the request is for.  The device_id can be used
for this data - as that matches the nova instance UUID.

This is valuable in scenarios where there are hundreds of VMs on the
system.  Rather than having every request query the entire system, this
change allows us to only get the data that we need for the request that
comes in.

This change required bundling together data from both the neutron port
and the device detail.  As such, a new entity called NetworkDevice was
added that pulls together these two pieces of information.

The individual values can still be overridden in user_variables

With cinder_volumes we were creating a specific udev device, this will
fail to mount if lxc.autodev=1. This should only be required when lvm is
a backend for the cinder_volumes container.

We can specify lxc.autodev=0 for cinder_volumes containers. To do this
properly we first check if lvm is in use. We can also use this to ensure
that redundant ""lvm"" configuration isn't setup on volumes hosts with no
lvm backend.

Additionally this will fix the formatting on the ""udev"" lxc.mount.entry
as it was adding additional spaces.

With the creation of the new openstack_config provider, some processing
that was done in tempest_config has been centralized in
openstack_config.

Impacted methods are :

  * section

  * separator

Also, this commit adds the fact that, when passing a specific string
(ensure_absent_val) the provider will behave as if ensure => absent was
specified. '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' is the default value for
ensure_absent_val.

The use case is the following :

tempest_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => 'bar' } # will work as usual

tempest_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' } # will mean absent

That means that all the current :

}

can be removed in favor of :

If for any reason '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' turns out to be a valid value for

In Ansible we adjust some templates to all work around differences
between the different Linux families.

Right now, the os-ansible-deployment project doesn't have automatically
published docs, and we're waiting on a project rename and move before
pushing to the openstack.org docs location.

Primarily, we have submitted for the project to go from
'stackforge/os-ansible-deployment' to 'openstack/openstack-ansible'.
Since this is not just a namespace move but also a project rename, we're
holding off on a docs.openstack.org job to reduce any potential
conflict. See https://review.openstack.org/#/c/191105/ for more
information.

This change allows us to automatically build to readthedocs.org in the
meantime.

SQLite doesn't support 'drop constraint' statament. So it notifies:

as primary_key=True, not matching locally specified columns
'encryption_id'; setting the current primary key columns to
'encryption_id'. This warning may become an exception in a future

renamed to original one.

Sphinx and OpenStack documentation standards require the use of
RST formatted documentation.  In order to get out docs integrated
into docs.openstack.org, the following steps must be taken:

1. we need to first convert the documentation to RST
2. sphinx support must be added to the repository
3. project-config must be updated with a publish-docs job

The ability to pubish to docs.openstack.org is a privilege only
available to Big Tent projects.  As a result, we should be taking
advantage of this to help spread the word on our implementation.

Note the documentation was converted with a tool called pandoc
the syntax of which was:
pandoc -f markdown -t rst file.md > z
mv z file.rst

In order for git to preserve history the files have to be git mv'ed
in one commit followed by the pandoc operation in a separate commit.

os_cinder is not updated because ceph is defined as a backend and that
is generated from a dictionary of the config, for an example backend
config, see etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_user_config.yml.example

pw-token-gen.py is updated so that variables ending in uuid are assigned
a UUID.

* The EnvironmentDescription class describes an entire fullstack
  environment (as opposed to the currently implemented host-only
  descriptions). This will allow future patches to signify that a test
  should set up an environment that supports tunneling, l2pop, QoS and
  more.
* Now, most fullstack fixtures (config and process ones, at least),
  expect both the EnvironmentDescription for the current test and the
  HostDescription for the 'host' the config/process is on. This allows
  for easier and most robust future changes, as now adding a new
  parameter to one of the description objects doesn't mean adding that
  argument to a number of other objects which are using it.
* Changed HostDescription's default argument of l3_agent to False, since
  adding new configurations and defualting them to True forces the
  author to go through ALL the tests and explicitly turn them on/off.
  However, defaulting new configurations to False only requires
  explicitly turning them on, which we ought to do anyway.

Galera logs by default to /var/log/mysql_logs these logs are being
ignored and not mounted properly on the host server, because the
service_name that is used to mount the log directory is ""galera"" and not
""mysql_logs"".

This patch adds an option to set the log_directory specifically inside
the env.d yml files, but defaults to ""service_name"" when the
log_directory option isn't set. This will mean functionality remains
unchanged for all services.

Additionally, the log_directory has changed to ""mysql_logs"" for galera
containers, to resolve the galera log issue.

Commit a7a0b4e542a65b3ba3650db2b7560eb587b9606c changed
_get_instance_disk_info to return a list rather than a json string.  As
part of that, it overwrote the local disk_info variable (which was a
dict) in _hard_reboot before it was passed to
_create_domain_and_network.  Eventually when disk_info gets down to
_create_domain_setup_lxc it fails the _is_booted_from_volume because
it's a list rather than a dict.

This moves the _get_instance_disk_info call in _hard_reboot within the
context.auth_token block since the return value is otherwise not needed,
and creates a unique local variable for the instance disk_info so it
doesn't collide with the disk_info that comes back from
blockinfo.get_disk_info.

At some point we should create objects for these various disk_info
variables because otherwise it's really confusing trying to track the
types and usage of all of these different things called 'disk_info'
which are sometimes dicts and sometimes lists of dicts.

The list_opts entrypoint test failed unnecessarily when the
dependencies in the packages were inconsistent. This test doesn't
need to verify that the dependencies are consistent, only that the
entrypoint is available and provides the expected function.

For the backport, I needed to remove the stevedore additions to
test-requirements-py3.txt and test-requirements.txt because
stevedore is already in requirements.txt.

Commit dcd33757dbcfee3c9a0e623f04a722c91de7ed0c added a check and
warning if multiple cluster names are specified since we want to map one
nova-compute service to a single vmware cluster.

This adds the same information to the config option help text since
that's what goes in the docs and the nova.conf.sample file for operators
to read before using the option (since they might not see the warning in
the logs).

The plan is to eventually enforce this with change
Ifc17c5049e3ed29c8dd130339207907b00433960.

The 12.0.0 Liberty version reference is based on the version proposed
in change I6a35fa0dda798fad93b804d00a46af80f08d475c.

DocImpact: Updated help text for the vmware.cluster_name option. The
           Kilo release notes have been retroactively updated to state
           the deprecation warning since the original change did not
           have an UpgradeImpact tag in the commit mesage.

The individual values can still be overridden in user_variables
by using nova_dhcp_domain or neutron_dhcp_domain, but it's expected

Additionally, ps -o pgid= <PID> may return a leading space which breaks
the logic. This change removes the spaces from the ps results to ensure
we can properly use the pgid. This change also updates the restart logic
to not attempt to call the script within the namespace as that should be
properly handled by the ocf script.

The Extension resource for both Network and Compute were missing two
pieces that would help their find_extension methods work: for one, the
`alias` is actually the ID of an extension, and no ID value was set. If
we knew what the ID was, we could find it (or not find it) directly.
Before that can even be done, we would need to be able to get it by ID,
and we didn't have allow_retrieve set on either of those resources.
Allowing Extension resources to be retrieved by ID causes them to now be
found.

z/VM is a hypervisor running on IBM System Z. This patch
adds the definitions needed for binding ports and defining
the ZVM agent identifier.

The mechanism driver is part of a separate networking-zvm repository,
but we still need those definitions in neutron to ensure that
they will stay unique and do not get changed.

This is just adding the definitions.

Since Nova doesn't currently provide an API call to indicate whether
its quotas are disabled, we could use a parameter named
'enable_quotas' within 'OPENSTACK_HYPERVISOR_FEATURES' setting for
this purpose. This allows to avoid errors while trying to update
quotas which are disabled on service side. Also make disabled_quotas
collection to be a set instead of a list - this removes duplicate
fields that appear due to some possible quota overlaps between Nova
and Neutron.

Block migration flags default to tunneled migration (via libvirt
connection), while for live migration we explicitly avoid that in
favor of plain migration (direct connection between qemu instances).

Make the behaviour of both types of migrations consistent by removing
the VIR_MIGRATE_TUNNELLED flag from the block migration flags.

This effectively fixes the issue with the libvirt version we have,
which segfaults in tunneled migration.

Another reason to give up on tunneled migration is LP #1246201, fix
for which will be only available for plain migration.

By default, admin_state_up is set to True in _test_create_resource.
If a resource doesn't need to package admin_state_up then it's resource
name should be mentioned in ""non_admin_status_resources"" explicitly.

The current logic doesn't work for the extension project/s which are
developed outside the tree but depends upon the existing test framework
for running their unit test-cases. To address this issue, the patch adds
a new registration interface for non_admin_status_resources using which
one can add their resource to non_admin_status_resources and avoid
admin_state_up packaging.

This change reverts commit b1838c258df2465756e551fdb879b1d4a748cb2b.

This makes network manager go back to issuing security group refresh
calls directly instead of going through conductor now that the
compute api call it is making is converted to objects.

This also removes and deprecates the conductor proxying code that
becomes unused after this change.

Sphinx and OpenStack documentation standards require the use of
RST formatted documentation.  In order to get out docs integrated
into docs.openstack.org, the following steps must be taken:
1. we need to first convert the documentation to RST
2. sPhinx support must be added to the repository
3. project-config must be updated with a publish-docs job

The ability to pubish to docs.openstack.org is a privilege only
available to Big Tent projects.  As a result, we should be taking
advantage of this to help spread the word on our implementation.

Note the documentation was converted with a tool called pandoc
the syntax of which was:

git mv $FILE.md $FILE.rst
pandoc -f markdown -t rst file.md > z
mv z $FILE.rst

During the upgrade of the API surface with running computes we're
going to see disconnects and reconnects for the service group API (as
conductor is gone). This is not an ERROR, but a normally expected
thing.

Change the connect to an INFO

Change the disconnect to a WARNING (if it happens a lot someone should
look into it).

In both cases try to be a lot more specific, because 'model server' is
really vague and not a term we use in ops facing documentation.

Why use notify all L3 agent rather than specific L3 agent?

In pulic clouds, there are many machines. If fanout the RPC messages
when create/update ports, it will make MQ more heavier and plugins
and agents can't synchronous when MQ blocked. So I suggest use notify
specific host rather than fanout.

Many distros create and distribute images based on the v1.0.0 code from

While using --autofree may be a good practice (it frees the image after

support for people using the stable version of iPXE and it will continue
to work with the images built from the master.

* Full stack tests' fake VMs are represented via a namespace,
  MAC, IP address and default gateway. They're plugged to an OVS
  bridge via an OVS internal port. As opposed to the current
  fake machine class used in functional testing, this new fake
  machine also creates a Neutron port via the API and sets the
  IP and MAC according to it. It also sets additional attributes
  on the OVS port to allow the OVS agent to do its magic.
* The functional fake machine and the full stack fake machine
  should continue to share commonalities.
* The fullstack fake machine currently takes the IP address
  from the port and statically assigns it to the namespace
  device. Later when I'll add support for the DHCP agent
  in full stack testing this assignment will look for the dhcp
  attribute of the subnet and either assign the IP address
  via 'ip' or call a dhcp client.
* Added a basic L2 connectivity test between two such machines
  on the same Neutron network.
* OVSPortFixture now uses OVSInterfaceDriver to plug the port
  instead of replicate a lot of the code. I had to make a
  small change to _setup_arp_spoof_for_port since all OVS ports
  are now created with their external-ids set.

The code was checking the tenant to determine if octavia had created the
vip port or not. If it did create the vip port then it would delete it, if not
it would not delete the port. Since neutron-lbaas merged a change that set
the device_owner appropriately on the port, we can now check device_owner for
ownership. This also adds octavia as the device_owner of the vip port if
it does create it and sets the device_id to the load balancer's id.

    * Convert configuration casts into blocking calls and move them
      from the task manager to the API. Update the Trove records
      only after a successful update on the guestagent.

    * Change the way how we apply the configuration changes.

       - On attach: Apply the values dynamically only if all of them
                    can be applied at once. Put the instance into
                    the 'RESTART_REQUIRED' state otherwise.
       - On detach: Apply the values dynamically only if:
                    a) Default values for all of them are
                       available in the configuration template.
                    b) All values can be applied at once.
                   Put the instance into the 'RESTART_REQUIRED'
                   state otherwise.

    * Remove override template resolution. Pass override values in a
      Python dict (like it is for 'apply_overrides').
      The user-provided configuration values do not get resolved and
      are applied as supplied by the user - hence no need for a template.
      It also avoids the need to double-parse the overrides in
      guestagents that do not support configuration imports.

    * Moved MySQL-specific value conversions (K, M, G suffixes)
      down to the MySQL guestagent.

    * Update the MySQL 'update_overrides' methods to accept both
      Python dicts and rendered strings. This is for backwards
      compatibility with older task managers that send overrides as
      a string.

    * Remove deprecated methods from the taskmanager.

Event should be acked or requeued when either event
conversion or event publishing fails by configuring
ack_on_event_error in configuration.

When publishing fails, the exception is not raised
in the pipeline and event does not get acked or
requeued, with a Handled message sent to transport
leading to event loss.

This fix raises the exception in pipeline on publish
failure and improves unit tests to test event handling
with a real pipeline.

There are common methods that all neutron based network drivers will most
likely implement the same way.  To prevent duplicate code, a common base driver
for all neutron drivers has been created. In the process of splitting this out,
cleaning up of some existing code was done as well.

The network driver's plug_network and unplug_network methods took an
amphora_id as a parameter, but it was always assumed to be the compute_id.
This parameter has been changed to compute_id.

The octavia interface network model originally had just a single ip_address,
but to more accurately reflect what neutron and probably other networking
as a services will return, this has been changed to fixed_ips because
interfaces and ports can have multiple ip addresses.

Other cleanup includes calling the network drivers own get_network, get_subnet,
and get_port methods instead of calling the neutron client's show_network,
show_subnet, and show_port methods.  Also, all of these changes required some
test changes as well.

Once we moved object_store from its own form of proxy to using the

full container object, so when instances were passed in a URL would be
created with the repr of an actual Container, which clearly doesn't
work.

There's an additional safety check in create_object to make sure a
container is passed in before trying an operation that won't work and
then raise a confusing exception.

Previously when listing images via v2, the first image of each batch
was validated against the v2 schema.

This could lead to unpredictable behaviour where a particular image
which failed the schema check may or may not be the first of a batch.

In some cases it also meant that operation by one user could affect the
ability of another other to list images.

If threshold is very large, for example, 21474836480, it would get
printed using scientific notation. If that expression was then used
to recreate the AlarmSubExpression, it would fail because the parser
didn't handle scientific notation.

So, instead use DecimalFormat to ensure a valid decimal number without
scientific notation. This then limits the threshold to 15 decimal
places, but that should be enough. It would be better to have no limit
but I have not been able to find a way to do that.

After starting provision after reset Astute is going to perform:

  3) erase all nodes;
  4) reboot already existed nodes;

Problem: The bug is the resource usage on database will not be updated
         after suspend/resume action. This will lead to the host
         resource cannot be reused after suspending instance(s)
         Refer bug 1402502 for details.

Solution: Update resource usage when suspend/resume is successful.
          And add a protection on resume action to avoid resource
          over-commitment on the host machine.

Detail: 1, Modify nova.compute.manager.ComputeManager. At the end of
           Suspend/Resume, call _instance_update() to update resource
           usage.

        2, Modify nova.compute.resource_tracker.ResourceTracker. Use a
           dict to record the suspended instance. Skip suspended
           instances during resource statistic procedure.

        3, Modify nova.compute.api.API. Invoke new RPC resume_instance()
           inside nova.conductor.manager.ComputeTaskManager, which will
           finally invoke RPC resume_instance() in
           nova.compute.manager.ComputeManager as previous.

        4, Add resume_instance() inside nova.conductor.ComputeTaskManager
           It will check original host capacity by invoking RPC call
           select_destinations() in nova.scheduler.host_manager.client

        5, New keywords 'suggested_nodes' and 'suggested_hosts' are added
           for selecting destination. With both keywords, nova.scheduler
           will firstly select hosts/nodes included in suggested_nodes
           or suggested_hosts. Then nova.scheduler will check the host
           capactiy. If no host has capacity to start the vm, NoValidHost
           exception will be thrown.

        6, Add unit test cases for modified code.

With the creation of the new openstack_config provider, some processing
that was done in sahara_config has been centralized in
openstack_config.

Impacted methods are :

  * section
  * setting
  * separator

Also, this commit adds the fact that, when passing a specific string
(ensure_absent_val) the provider will behave as if ensure => absent was
specified. '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' is the default value for
ensure_absent_val.

RabbitMQ supports such feature as temporary
queues with autogenerated names, it means that when you
define a queue, you leave the name empty, so RabbitMQ generates
a unique name with ""amq.gen-"" prefix, after fixing a bug [1]
with heartbeats, we got working reconnects in case of connectivity
issues. When reconnect happens, for queues with autogenerated
names RabbitMQ behaves strangely, it does not delete previous queues
but creates new one, so for a single worker there is old/not
used queue and the new one. When new message comes to exchange
it has 50% chance to get into working queue. If there more
reconnects happen, more dead queues are created and we have
less chance to get message in working queue.

In order to prevent that, each worker should have unique
name for its service queue, which it will use during worker's
life time. When reconnect happens, it will try to connect to
the same queue which was used before.

A project admin should not be able to affect service-wide resources.

With the implementation of the quotas blueprint, there is a need for
a new limited purpose role.  This role will be able to manage project
quotas, but will not have access to projects' stored keys and secrets.

This change request proposes the new role (""key-manager:service-admin"")
that can be used for this purpose.

The changes are implemented in the default policy and will
give this new role access to set, read, and delete project quotas.  It
will also have access to the resources and actions available to ""all_users"".
The default policy grants no other permissions to this role.

Currently value of `my_ip' config option is used as image cache dir
prefix to prevent races between nova-compute instances using the same
datastore.

The common practice of making nova-compute (with vmwareapi driver
chosen) HA is to have it run in active/passive mode controlled by
Pacemaker.  In that case Pacemaker can move nova-compute instance to
another host, should something happen to the original one, which
effectively will cause change of the IP address - thus, all cached
images will have to be re-downloaded again, despite the fact they are
still there in the datastore and still belong to this particular
nova-compute instance.

I02e758af19cf3a652a5c39d02904e73a1088fe60 made it possible to use the
`cache_prefix' config option to denote, which cache directory should
be used by a particular nova-compute instance. As long as we set the
same `cache_prefix' value for all nova-compute processes running in
active/passive mode, the cache directory will be the same on every
host.

the factory function always passes region_name, so it's
