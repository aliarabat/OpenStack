There are 2 ways to obtain the service data from keystone.
First one is a service catalog. It is available from both admin and
regular users. The second one is 'admin-only' and includes more data.

Let's obtain more data when it is possible (i.e. call admin-only method)

As the comment in the code suggests, when calling migrate_instance_finish
in finish_revert_resize we need to temporarily set the migration
object dest_compute to the source_compute since we are moving port
bindings from the dest back to the source. However, this is not
really a temporary change to the object if something fails after
this because the @errors_out_migration decorator will persist the
change which could be confusing later if trying to debug this migration
from the API and the dest_compute and source_compute have the same value.

This fixes the issue by using the temporary_mutation utility.

Also, the obj_to_primitive dance in here is removed since it is not
necessary as migrate_instance_finish handles a Migration object.

The variables zun_developer_mode and zun_venv_download
no longer carry any meaning. This review changes zun to
do the equivalent of what developer_mode was all the time,
meaning that it always builds the venv and never requires
the repo server, but it will use a repo server when available.

As part of this, we move the installation out of its own file
because it's now a single task to include the venv build role.
This is just to make it easier to follow the code.

We also change include_tasks to import_tasks and include_role
to import_role so that the tags in the python_venv_build role
will work.

As part of commit xenial testing was removed. Instead centos 7
and opensuse 15 functional tests were added.

Since introducing distro. installs, we have two different role
inclusions, one for distro and one for source.  It seems that this
was done to send a different set of variables to each run.

With the recent build changes, all the branch variables are already
included using from openstack_services.yml so there's no need to
redefine them.

This means we can bring the two includes back to a normal role
reference, which resolves a few issues around using import_role and
brings back the ability to use tags only with this playbook.

QoS rule (QosBandwidthLimitRule and QosMinimumBandwidthRule) update now
expects to have direction field in the API request for checking for
duplicates.
This patch changes this by using the rule fetched from the policy and
the update will work on that rule object instead of a newly created
object which for minimum_bandwidth rule has no default direction, which
causes the update to fail.

Multi-vif driver allows additional vifs to be attached to a
single pod.

A new optional parameter ""extra_specs"" is introduced to request_vif in
pod-vif-drivers and get_subnets in PodSubnetsDriver to distinguish
among multiple vifs for a single pod.

This commit also adds AnnotationMultiVIFDriver, an implementation of
multi-vif driver. A new annotation ""openstack.org/kuryr-multi-vif-specs""
is introduced, which can be used by the user to request additional vifs
with given specifications.

Each vif's driver depends upon pod annotation and label of the node
where the pod is scheduled. All the vifs are then managed by the
corresponding drivers.

Partially Implements: blueprint multi-vif-pods

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

This is a mechanically generated change to replace openstack.org
git:// URLs with https:// equivalents.

This is in aid of a planned future move of the git hosting
infrastructure to a self-hosted instance of gitea (https://gitea.io),
which does not support the git wire protocol at this stage.

This update should result in no functional change.

All of the methods of common db mixin are available via neutron-lib

This patch switches the code over to use neutron-lib's APIs rather
than those of the mixin.

The previous patch changes things to import_role instead of using
include_role which seems to have caused issues in the gate raising
the following error:

  ERROR! The requested handler 'systemd service changed' was
  not found in either the main handlers list nor in the listening
  handlers list

This seems to be related to behaviour changes around how things work
when using include/import.  This patch brings back old behaviour
to fix this issue.

The variables placement_developer_mode and placement_venv_download
no longer carry any meaning. This review changes placement to
do the equivalent of what developer_mode was all the time,
meaning that it always builds the venv and never requires
the repo server, but it will use a repo server when available.

As part of this, we move the source build out of its own file
because it's now a single task to include the venv build role.
This is just to make it easier to follow the code.

to do this without dropping linting jobs.

This patch allows us to replace openstack-ansible-role-jobs by
openstack-ansible-linters to keep linters and add new jobs as
we need/want.

This patch rehomes neutron.db.standard_attr into neutron_lib.db.
Unit tests and a release note are also included, however note that
the StandardAttrRevisesBulkDeleteTestCase and
StandardAttrAPIImapctTestCase unit test classes will be left in neutron
since they require HasStandardAttributes subclasses that live in neutron
to be first loaded.

Sometimes, when deploying with user root, the local repo has files
of mode 0600. This has been found to cause ""Permission denied""
errors when deploying Glance.

This little fix is to explicitly set a more permissive file mode on
those files to allow the deployment of Glance to setup it's service
and endpoints.

The variables blazar_developer_mode and blazar_venv_download
no longer carry any meaning. This review changes blazar to
do the equivalent of what developer_mode was all the time,
meaning that it always builds the venv and never requires
the repo server, but it will use a repo server when available.

As part of this, we move the source build out of its own file
because it's now a single task to include the venv build role.
This is just to make it easier to follow the code.

It looks like the project now needs authentication for the root
of the host so we'll test for that instead of 204.

that are auto-removed, because waiting for non-auto-removed volumes

Fixes an issue when the image source is a local file, the image
will be truncated to 2G and fails deployment due to image corruption.

The issue originates from pysendfile, but local testing shows this
also applies to python3.5 os.sendfile().

This cleans up a few things in the finish_resize flow:

* Use object dot notation rather than rely on NovaObjectDictCompat
  specifically for the migration object.
* migrate_instance_finish does not need a migration dict, it takes
  an object, so remove the to_primitive call.
* Add some comments to help explain what's going on and why we
  don't rollback port bindings for neutron in case the guest
  creation fails.
* Renames 'instance_type' usage to 'flavor'.
* Drops the elevated context when saving migration status changes
  since that is not necessary.

There is similar cruft in the resize_instance flow but that
can be dealt with separately.

The variables tacker_developer_mode and tacker_venv_download
no longer carry any meaning. This review changes tacker to
do the equivalent of what developer_mode was all the time,
meaning that it always builds the venv and never requires
the repo server, but it will use a repo server when available.

As part of this, we move the source build out of its own file
because it's now a single task to include the venv build role.
This is just to make it easier to follow the code.

We also change include_tasks to import_tasks and include_role
to import_role so that the tags in the python_venv_build role
will work.

In addition tacker init was replaced by the standard systemd_service
role. Due to this was added new variable tacker_init_config_overrides.
program_override variable has no influence now.

In config notification_driver was deprecated in favor of driver from
oslo_messaging_notifications

statement and render the value of the diver correctly.

This is a mechanically generated change to replace openstack.org
git:// URLs with https:// equivalents.

This is in aid of a planned future move of the git hosting
infrastructure to a self-hosted instance of gitea (https://gitea.io),
which does not support the git wire protocol at this stage.

This update should result in no functional change.

When generating or updating the passwords.yml file for kolla-ansible,
kayobe writes out various stages of the process to temporary files
in /tmp, in plain text. One of these files can be left in place if
there are no changes to apply to the file.

This change ensures that we always remove temporary files containing
passwords. We also switch from shutil.copy2 to shutil.copyfile, to
keep the permissions of the destination rather than applying those of
the source, which are typically more open (644 vs 600).

Currently the new Attachment calls in Cinder aren't checking the status
of the volume when create or update is called.  This isn't good because
it can mask problems with attach processes on the volume.

This patch adds an explicit check of the volume status in both
attachment_create and attachment_update, and if the volume status is in
any error state, the call will result in an InvalidVolume exception.

This is an API change to fix a bug, and is not microversioned.

Previously d3 version of the network topology view handles ports with
device_owner 'compute:nova' and 'compute:None' specially. This leads
to the situtaion that neutron ports with non-default AZ are not shown
properly. There is no reason to handle neutron ports with the default
AZ differently. What we would like to do is just to classify neutron
ports attached to nova servers.

This commit changes the logic to check device_owner of ports have
a prefix 'compute:'. Note that we also need to check if device_owner
is a string before checking the prefix.

- sahara-scenario is executed using Python 3 by default.
  Now that the all the older stable branches use venv-py2 explicitly,
  the scenario test runner can use python3 as default Python version.
- move the Python 3 job from the experimental to the check queue.
- add a Python 3 version of the multinode Spark job.
  In order to do that, the parent of the multinode-spark
  job is not the radosgw-based scenario job, so that
  it can use the Python 3-ready RadosGW instead of Swift,
  which is still not fully ported.
- add an EDP test too to the multinode scenario jobs.

All the Python 3-based jobs also run sahara-scenario using Python 3.
The other way is not always true: sahara-scenario runs with
Python 3 also when DevStack uses Python 2.

For FC connections there are multiple places where we check the
initiator target map provided by the backend against the port names of
the HBAs on the system.

Currently this check is case sensitive, but some backends are returning
the port names in the initiator target map upper cased, which usually
results in attach failures.

Some of the reasons for the attach failures is that os-brick will not
issue scan requests.

Example from a 3PAR backend from a specific system:

  Connector properties:
    {
     'wwpns': ['10001409dcd71ff6', '10001409dcd71ff7'],
     'wwnns': ['20001409dcd71ff6', '20001409dcd71ff7'],
     ...
    }

  Connection properties:
    {
     'initiator_target_map': {
       '10001409DCD71FF6': ['20320002AC01E166', '21420002AC01E166'],
       '10001409DCD71FF7': ['20410002AC01E166', '21410002AC01E166']
     }
     ...
    }

This patch converts to lower case the
initiator_target_map and the target_wwn/target_wwns.

The variables rally_developer_mode and rally_venv_download
no longer carry any meaning. This review changes rally to
do the equivalent of what developer_mode was all the time,
meaning that it always builds the venv and never requires
the repo server, but it will use a repo server when available.

As part of this, we move the source build out of its own file
because it's now a single task to include the venv build role.
This is just to make it easier to follow the code.

Rally doesn't uses upper-constraints. We rely on stable releases,
for that reason, we don't need vars like rally_git_contraints,
rally_git_repo and rally_git_install_branch.

With this configuration, the database Mnesia reduces the activity to
the disk. It is useful when a huge of queues/exchanges/bindings are
created and destroyed.

When resizing a server that was not created in an explicit
zone, the scheduler can pick a host in another zone and
conductor will update the instance.availability_zone value
for the new dest host zone.

The problem is when reverting the resize, the server goes
back to the original source host/zone but the
instance.availability_zone value in the database is not
updated which can lead to incorrect results when listing
servers and filtering by zone.

This fixes the bug by updating the instance.availability_zone
value in the API (where we have access to the aggregates
table in the API DB) before casting to nova-compute to
complete the revert. As noted in the comment within, this
is not fail-safe in case the revert fails before the
instance.host is updated in finish_revert_resize, but we
don't have a lot of great backportable options here that
don't involve ""up-calls"" from the compute to the API DB.

This makes the grep match in check_python3_support_for_package_local
the same as check_python3_support_for_package_remote.

Change I0349de2026c49279ba7f262d5e86d37018d66326 in grenade started
setting the PYTHON3_VERSION variable, and then we recently started
using bionic nodes everywhere which means we're running python 3.6.

The etcd3gw package has a python 3 and 3.5 classifier, but not 3.6:

https://pypi.org/project/etcd3gw/

The pip_install function code that is dealing with installing py3
packages is hitting a problem installing etcd3gw if the package is
local because of the more restrictive grep in the
check_python3_support_for_package_local function, and since
PYTHON3_VERSION=3.6 now, we don't install from py3 and install
etcd3gw on python 2.7 which makes services like cinder-volume and
cinder-backup, which use etcd3gw, fail when they are running under
python 3 (they get module import errors).

This simply removes the $ restriction on the grep. Looking at the
change that added those local/remote functions:

  I243ea4b76f0d5ef57a03b5b0798a05468ee6de9b

There is no explanation for the difference, it just said:

  Also, since not many packages are classified correctly, fallback
  to looking for just ""Programming Language :: Python :: 3"" and
  log a message for the package to highlight the problem.

So that's what this change does.

Note that alternatives would be:

1. Update the etcd3gw package to add the 3.6 classifier and do
   a release (this should probably happen anyway).

2. Add etcd3gw to ENABLED_PYTHON3_PACKAGES but that would be a
   short-term hack workaround.

This patch adds two new jobs:

* kolla-ansible-centos-source-upgrade
* kolla-ansible-ubuntu-source-upgrade

These jobs first deploy a control plane using the previous release of
Kolla Ansible, then upgrade to the current release.

Because we can't change the branch of the git repository on the Zuul
executor, we change the branch of the kolla-ansible repository on the
primary node to the branch of the previous release, in this case
stable/rocky. A new remote-template role has been added that supports
generating templates using a remote template source, to generate config
files using the previous kolla-ansible branch.

If the change being tested depends on a kolla change for the current
branch, then we build images. Rather than using the current
kolla-ansible version to tag the images, we now tag them with
change_<gerrit change ID>. This is because the version of kolla-ansible
will change from the previous release to the current one as we upgrade
the system.

Finally, it should be noted that the 'previous_release' variable in the
Zuul config needs to be updated with each release, since this sets the
release of kolla-ansible that is installed initially.

When first added, the bare metal deployment tests using Tenks were
fairly reliable (although not 100%). Recently though, jobs seem to be
failing at this step quite frequently, making it difficult to merge
patches. Looking at the historical zuul jobs, the failure rate per job
seems to be about 1/3:
http://zuul.openstack.org/builds?job_name=kayobe-overcloud-centos. With
two overcloud jobs and check and gate required to pass, the merge
success rate is around 20%.

Let's skip this testing for now, until we can make it more reliable.

Adapted from I2840ec32cffcaf5d7f32a91907d51c1a500f19f1.

Currently all of the opensuse jobs are failing due to being
unable to install pyparsing via pip. The failure signature is:

Cannot uninstall 'pyparsing'. It is a distutils installed project and
thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would
lead to only a partial uninstall.

The usual solution to this problem is to install Python packages in a
virtual environment. This change modifies the zuul CI jobs to use a
virtual environment for all openSUSE jobs.

This patch is a proposal of datastore versioning.

This patch introduces support for newer Cassandra versions. It uses
change Ia2c5af842e1230b1d7152c5fb80ddd07af2cfc9c as a base.

Changes from Cassandra 2.1 (current):

 - 'credentials' table was renamed to 'roles'.
    update the statement

 - The 'schema_keyspaces' table has been removed.
   Obtain the list of keyspaces from the cluster
   metadata instead (compatible with v2.1).

 - Some new configuration properties were added.
   Add updated templates and validation rules.
   Apply extra settings in the prepare call.

This patch adds guestagent implementations for Cassandra 2.2. Old
implementation is now explicitly labeled as 2.1.

Common base classes are moved to cassandra package.

Newly exposed configuration properties:

Cassandra 2.2 (from 2.1):

    roles_validity_in_ms
    roles_update_interval_in_ms
    row_cache_class_name
    commitlog_compression
    batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb
    unlogged_batch_across_partitions_warn_threshold
    tracetype_query_ttl
    tracetype_repair_ttl
    windows_timer_interval

When instance is created from cinder volume, it's image is not displayed
Nowdays using cinder as instance source becomes more widespread,
so there is sense in displaying instance image,
when instance is created from cinder volumes.
We're trying to get volume_image_metadata from the first volume of
the instance, when instance doesn't have image attribute itself.
First volume is suggested based on its device name (eg. '/dev/vda').

This info is displayed only in instances list, not in detail overview.

This change ensures that resources are updated only once per
update_available_resource() call.

Compute resources were previously updated during host
object initialization and at the end of
update_available_resource(). It could cause inconsistencies
in resource tracking between compute host and DB for couple
of second when final _update() at the end of
update_available_resource() is being called.

For example: nova-api shows that host uses 10GB of RAM, but
in fact its 12GB because DB doesn't have resources that belongs
to shutdown instance.

Because of that fact nova-scheduler (CachingScheduler) could
choose (based on imcomplete information) host which is already full.

The ComputeNode object itself has a facade which provides the
actual default values for cpu, disk and ram allocation ratios
when the config option values are left at the default (0.0).

When we initially create a ComputeNode in the ResourceTracker,
the *_allocation_ratio values in the object are going to be
unset, and then _copy_resources, called from _init_compute_node,
will set the values to the config option values, again, defaulted
to 0.0, but the ComputeNode object, after calling create() or
save(), will change those *on the object* to the non-0.0 we
actually know and love (16.0 for cpu, 1.5 for ram, and 1.0 for disk).

During the update_available_resource periodic, we'll again go
through _init_compute_node and _copy_resources in the ResourceTracker
which will set the configured values (default of 0.0) onto the
ComputeNode object, which makes the _resource_change method, called
from _update, return True and trigger a ComputeNode.save() call
from the _update method. At that point we're *persisting* the 0.0
allocation ratios in the database, even though ComputeNode.save
will change them to their non-0.0 default values *on the object*
because of the _from_db_object call at the end of ComputeNode.save.

So even if the ComputeNode object allocation ratio values are the
non-0.0 defaults, we'll *always* update the database on every
periodic even if nothing else changed in inventory.

This change modifies the _copy_resource method to only update the
ComputeNode fields if the configured ratios are not the 0.0 default.

This is a follow up to I43a23a3290db0c835fed01b8d6a38962dc61adce
which makes the cpu/disk/ram_allocation_ratio config ""sticky"" in
that once set to a non-default value, it is not possible to reset
back to the default behavior (when config is 0.0) on an existing
compute node record by unsetting the option from nova.conf. To
reset back to the defaults, the non-0.0 default would have to be
explicitly put into config, so cpu_allocation_ratio=16.0 for example.

Alternatively operators could delete the nova-compute service
record via the DELETE /os-services/{service_id} REST API and
restart the nova-compute service to get a new compute_nodes record,
but that workaround is messy and left undocumented in config.

Installing and configuring tmpwatch allows to get rid of some
ugly things in logrotate configuration. As the container has no
network access anymore, we have to install the tool on the host
directly - this isn't that bad.

In order to avoid issues with logrotate manage logs, we explicitely
exclude patterns manage in the specific logorate configuration.

Also, always in order to avoid issues and ensure logrotate does its
own cleanup, we clean files one day later.

Note: this patch is the port of [1].
We can't really cherry-pick things since we have to correct the
heat_template_version value, and config-download not really supported,
meaning we can't use the ""deploy_steps_tasks"" as is.

Adds ignore_basepython_conflict tox.ini in order to avoid conflict
displayed if tox is run on machine that is using py36 or py36 default

Ignores missing interpreters as developer may not have the full
range of python interpreters installed.

This change has no impact on CI execution as there tox is always

When updating variables that would result in a modified

/etc/tempest.conf would get updated properly.  A tempest
init happens after and does not copy those into an
existing workspace.  This change allows backup workspaces

The variables trove_developer_mode and trove_venv_download
no longer carry any meaning. This review changes trove to
do the equivalent of what developer_mode was all the time,
meaning that it always builds the venv and never requires
the repo server, but it will use a repo server when available.

As part of this, we move the source build out of its own file
because it's now a single task to include the venv build role.
This is just to make it easier to follow the code.

The variables sahara_developer_mode and sahara_venv_download
no longer carry any meaning. This review changes sahara to do
the equivalent of what developer_mode was all the time,
meaning that it always builds the venv and never requires
the repo server, but it will use a repo server when available.

As part of this, we move the source build out of its own file
because it's now a single task to include the venv build role.
This is just to make it easier to follow the code.

Zun has a feature to auto cleanup container's volumes on deleting
a container. In before, compute manager issue API call to cinder
to request deleting the cinder volumes and wait for the cinder
to complete the deletion. However, we should wait for the volumes
that are auto-removed, because waiting for non-auto-removed volumes
will cause a timeout error obviously.

The dump-flows action will get a very large sets of flow information
if there are enormous ports or openflow security group rules. For now
we can meet some known exception during such action, for instance,
memory issue, timeout issue.
So after this patch, the cleanup action of the bridge stale flows
will be done one table by one table. But note, this only supports
for 'native' OpenFlow interface driver.

Previously d3 version of the network topology view handles ports with
device_owner 'compute:nova' and 'compute:None' specially. This leads
to the situtaion that neutron ports with non-default AZ are not shown
properly. There is no reason to handle neutron ports with the default
AZ differently. What we would like to do is just to classify neutron
ports attached to nova servers.

This commit changes the logic to check device_owner of ports have
a prefix 'compute:'. Note that we also need to check if device_owner
is a string before checking the prefix.

This is a mechanically generated change to replace openstack.org
git:// URLs with https:// equivalents.

This is in aid of a planned future move of the git hosting
infrastructure to a self-hosted instance of gitea (https://gitea.io),
which does not support the git wire protocol at this stage.

This update should result in no functional change.

This change starts the process of moving the Zuul project into its own
tenant in Zuul. Today we are only adding zuul/project-config and
opendev/base-jobs, but eventually we'll move other zuul projects into
here (after we confirm base jobs are working correctly).

Adding the comment flake8:noqa in a file will skip linting the entire
file. Most of the time, the intent was just to skip individual lines to
handle exception cases.

This gets rid of the ""flake8:"" prefix where it was used incorrectly and
fixes a few legitimate errors that were being hidden by the entire file
being skipped.

The behavior is change in flake8 to handle this better, which will
result in pep8 job failures if these are not fixes first. See more
information in the 3.6.0 release notes:
