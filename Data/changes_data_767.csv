In order to backport changes to Newton, mysql-python tests need
to pass, since it seems that tox.ini is still forcing MySQL
tests to use MySQL-Python (not pymysql or mysqlclient at least).
The change here re: libmysqlclient is impacting Newton, so backport.

Something changed in mysql-python / libmysqlclient or mysql and now
exceptions that used to be InternalError's have become OperationalError's.
Update filters accordingly to wrap those into oslo.db exceptions
properly.

OperationalError's are kind of special, as we re-raise them as is due
to historical reasons: we need to make sure that at least SAVEPOINT
errors are wrapped, as that's what oslo.db and neutron unit tests
expect.

Closes-Bug: #1630899

Right now the do_listdir option was set on every 10th replication run.
Due to the randomness of the job listing this might update a given
partition much less often than expected - sometimes only every 100th
run, and this is clearly not wanted.

This patch tracks the partitions that run a listdir recently, and
selects ~1/10 of the partitions in the next run that haven't been
updated yet. This way it is much more deterministic and predictable.

These settings are all legacy, as for some time heat has instead supported
deriving the URLs internally using the endpoints from the keystone catalog.

Defaulting these to localhost seems like a bad default, as in
most cases heat will caclulate a more reasonable default (e.g something
derived from the actual heat public endpoint in keystone), and it's somewhat
surprising when you don't pass a value and get localhost instead of the heat
defaults.

They can still be used to override the keystone endpoint, which is sometimes
useful, but in most cases these should no longer be set IMO.

Note the relevant heat commits which make these settings optional are
Id402664e38e3da071ad634233b3a1f8e13af152d and

In our db.volume_type_get method we allow specifying expected_fields,
which are fields that are going to get joinloaded with the query, but we
only allow loading the projects and not the qos_specs.

This patch makes it possible to load the qos_specs related entries when
retrieving a volume type.

VolumeType OVO class does not allow lazy loading of attributes, which is
usually not a problem if you are loading the volume type using
get_by_id, but is a problem if you load for example a list of volumes
and then go to their volume_type.extra_specs, as this will raise an
error because extra_specs cannot be retrieved.

This patch changes VolumeType OVO class to allow lazy loading all
optional fields.

This adds the necessary hieradata for enabling TLS for MySQL (which
happens to run on the internal network). It also adds a template so
this can be done via certmonger. As with other services, this will
fill the necessary specs for the certificate to be requested in a
hash that will be consumed in puppet-tripleo.

Note that this only enables that we can now use TLS, however, we still
need to configure the services (or limit the users the services use)
to only connect via SSL. But that will be done in another patch, as
there is some things that need to land before we can do this (changes
in puppetlabs-mysql and puppet-openstacklib).

In Manila, the only thing users can do with snapshots is to create new
shares from them. Alternate snapshot semantics were discussed in Tokyo
and Austin. At the Austin Summit, the community agreed one of the new
snapshot semantics would be to revert a share (in place) by restoring
the most recent snapshot of that share taken by Manila.

This patch sets NeutronL3HA to false when the DVR environment is
included on deployment. L3 HA isn't supported with DVR routers and is
disabled by defaults in our templates but upgrading users might have it
enabled in their existing overclouds.  Including the setting here with
an appropriate comment gives us some sort of mechanism to convey to the
upgrading user what they need to do. This will have no effect on users
not using L3 HA or deploying new overclouds.

what it actually does.
I.e. create_serial_console_devices was renamed to
create_serial_console_tcp_devices, unrelated code was moved to upper
_create_consoles function to make its if/else logic flat.

1. The consistencygroup_id and metadata parameters are optional.
2. Several parameters used were for non-volume types, this changes
   the api-ref to use the proper parameters that have the correct

At some point the parameter names in parameters.yaml need to have
more descriptive names than the lazy *_1, *_2, etc names so it's
easier to know what a parameter is for,

Hitachi cinder driver throws a KeyError when one tries to
manage a volume without specifying a pool and without having
a service label configured as 'default'. This affects both
NFS and iSCSI drivers.

Adding a check to verify if a 'default' HNAS service type
exists when a volume type without service_label is passed
in volume manage and giving a proper exception message
when it fails instead of a KeyError exception.

Since 4b49e409f853104dae021dfca1a9342ec9ac4709 devstack
started to use reload instead of restart.

Using reload in devstack for a fresh install,
does not makes too much sense unless multiple service
plugin touches the same service configs.

Systemd rejects to reload something,
which was not loaded before.

 $ sudo /bin/systemctl reload httpd
 httpd.service is not active, cannot reload.

We will switch to `reload-or-restart` action instead of `reload`,
it is more likely the action what the previous patch wanted.

In test_list_servers_by_non_existing_flavor, 1234 is used as
non_existing_flavor, but it is not strange if someone happens
to use 1234 as flavor id in his environment.

Besides, we can use names containing 'non-existing' instead
of a hard-coded strange name for non-existing image/server/flavor
names, which will make code looks more clear.

*This is a work in progress*

*Update* - migrated DEVSTACK_GATE_VIRT_DRIVER, DEVSTACK_GATE_NEUTRON,
DEVSTACK_GATE_TEMPEST vars

*Info on change*
Much Ironic job configuration in devstack-gate
is vestigal from when you could not directly interact with devstack
configurations via project-config. We should eliminate these cases and
move the configurations into project-config to simplify devstack-gate
and project-config troubleshooting.

This is a patch to project-config, setting the appropriate variables
in DEVSTACK_LOCAL_CONFIG that devstack_gate currently uses,
WITHOUT removing anything from devstack gate.

After this the following steps will be taken

2) Patch devstack-gate to remove the DEVSTACK_GATE_IRONIC_* variables
that are no longer needed, so we use the configs created in step 1
from project config.

3) Patch project-config to cease setting the DEVSTACK_GATE_IRONIC_*
variables.

report client just take a resource provider UUID and a set of inventory
records. With upcoming patches, the compute node is not the only

client methods for adding resource provider and inventory records as
generic as possible instead of being specific to a compute node.

This patch is preparation step to move the instance creation to
the conductor. The goal is to move out the instance.create call from
the _provision_instances method.

The _provision_instances method return value is changed
from list of instances to the tuple containing a list of build_requests
and RequestSpec object. We also return the instance_mapping list so
that we can properly clean up residue if we fail to create in the caller.

Switch to the keystoneauth1 lib for creating the keystone session.
Now the keystone client in the quota code will honor the client
cert settings, too, thanks to the session loader in the new lib.

Active-Active configurations are not trivial, and therefore vendors need
to check that their drivers support these configurations and have no
issues.

Since users will most likely assume that once Active-Active is available
as a core functionality all drivers will be supporting it this could
lead to data loss, data corruption, or just bad user experience.

In order to prevent this, without a full Active-Active test suite, we
will rely on vendor ""auto certification"".

What this means is that Cinder won't allow any driver to start in an
Active-Active configuration by default until the vendor has tested their
driver's readiness and explicitly set in the code.

Vendors will set SUPPORTS_ACTIVE_ACTIVE class attribute to True in their
drivers to reflect the driver's readiness, or if the readiness depends
on some configuration options they can leave the class attribute with
the default False value and just set it as an instance attribute in
their __init__ method.

When an action or workflow with long input names is created, the
contents are getting truncated. To avoid this, this patch wraps
the contents of the input and description fields to improvise
the readibility.
