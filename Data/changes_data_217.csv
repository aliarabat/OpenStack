that issue as well.

Haproxy 1.8 brings in a specific change that breaks us:
It removes the haproxy-systemd-wrapper which
we use in order to be able to reload the config file without
restarting the whole container (important in TLS scenarios).

We fix this by calling the haproxy binary directly and
using the master-worker mode (-Ws) which allows to receive
a SIGUSR2 command which will then reload the config for
all the workers. It should also not background.

This commit keeps backward compatibility with current HAProxy
to ease the transition to new HAProxy.

Pioso,richard.pioso,"Fix Redfish handle no continuous override boot src

Some hardware Redfish services have dropped support for continuously
overriding the boot source when the boot mode is Unified Extensible
Firmware Interface (UEFI). See this discussion:
http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-discuss/2020-April/014543.html

A workaround falls back to one-time override, restoring it on every
reboot or power on. [1] However, it does not work, because, per the
Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) Redfish standard, one-time
override is disabled on the next boot cycle. [2] This fixes that by
explicitly setting the boot source override to one-time every time it is
restored.

When performing inspection on baremetal compute nodes, inspector
currently has the following failure when storing inspection data to the
introspection store:

    No 'keystoneauth1.plugin' driver found, looking for 'token_endpoint'

This happens because the token_endpoint auth type is no longer
available. The new way to do this is to set auth_type = none and provide
an endpoint override.

Currently the ordering of network interfaces in the seed VM is
non-deterministic. This happens because we apply the 'unique' filter to
the network_interfaces list, which does not guarantee a deterministic
ordering. This list is then transformed and passed to the
stackhpc.libvirt-vm role.

There are two consequences of this:

* it is not possible to determine which interface names should be used
  prior to creating a seed VM
* if a seed VM is recreated, the interface ordering may change

This change fixes the issue by sorting the network_interfaces list
alphabetically before it is transformed and passed to the
stackhpc.libvirt-vm.

A new 'seed_vm_interfaces' variable is also added, which allows for
customisation of the VM's interfaces - potentially allowing for more
complex setups such as trunked VLANs.

Story: 2007259
Task: 38621

There is a second issue, which is that if the seed VM has a
network interface not configured with a gateway, cloud-init will fail to
configure the network interfaces on the host. This has been observed on
CentOS 8, but is probably more tied to the version of cloud-init, and
may affect CentOS 7. The following error is seen in the cloud-init logs:

    KeyError: 'gateway'

This change has been addressed in the jriguera.configdrive role, and
this change updates the version used in requirements.yml.

Story: 2007769
Task: 39993

Currently the ordering of network interfaces in the seed VM is
non-deterministic. This happens because we apply the 'unique' filter to
the network_interfaces list, which does not guarantee a deterministic
ordering. This list is then transformed and passed to the
stackhpc.libvirt-vm role.

There are two consequences of this:

* it is not possible to determine which interface names should be used
  prior to creating a seed VM
* if a seed VM is recreated, the interface ordering may change

This change fixes the issue by sorting the network_interfaces list
alphabetically before it is transformed and passed to the
stackhpc.libvirt-vm.

A new 'seed_vm_interfaces' variable is also added, which allows for
customisation of the VM's interfaces - potentially allowing for more
complex setups such as trunked VLANs.

Story: 2007259
Task: 38621

There is a second issue, which is that if the seed VM has a
network interface not configured with a gateway, cloud-init will fail to
configure the network interfaces on the host. This has been observed on
CentOS 8, but is probably more tied to the version of cloud-init, and
may affect CentOS 7. The following error is seen in the cloud-init logs:

    KeyError: 'gateway'

This change has been addressed in the jriguera.configdrive role, and
this change updates the version used in requirements.yml.

The DEFAULT/ovs_integration_bridge parameter was deprecated in neutron
in favor of the new ovs/integration_bridge[1] parameter, so
puppet-neutron should use the new parameter accordingly.

Also, that parameter is also available in l3 agent configuration, so
the new parameter, ovs_integration_bridge, was added to l3 agent
manifest.

The Python 2.7 Support has been dropped since Ussuri.
So remove hacking rules for compatibility between python 2 and 3.

- [N325] str() and unicode() cannot be used on an exception.
         Remove or use six.text_type()
- [N327] Do not use xrange(). xrange() is not compatible with Python 3.
         Use range() or six.moves.range() instead.
- [N344] Python 3: do not use dict.iteritems.
- [N345] Python 3: do not use dict.iterkeys.
- [N346] Python 3: do not use dict.itervalues.

This patch introduces new parameters in manila::quota class so that
operators can set quota parameters for share replicas.

Also, this patch removes re-defining default value in quota class,
and make it use the default value defined in Manila itself.

This change adds a local CLI ./bifrost-cli that allows to easily
run bifrost playbooks. It is targeting early adopters and thus
is opinionated and does not expose all possible options.

Only the very minimum is provided in this patch. More options
will be added later as we decide they are important.

Documentation will also be provided later as it's going to be
quite large. This feature should be considered technical preview
at this point until we give it more testing.

Using --no-cache-dir flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.

Since adding support for Python 3, the following commands fail:

* kayobe baremetal compute inspect
* kayobe baremetal compute manage
* kayobe baremetal compute provide

There are two issues:

1. There is a missing /bin from the ansible_python_interpreter path used.

2. The stackhpc.os-ironic-nodes role fails with an undefined variable:

    name 'openstack_cloud_from_module' is not defined

This is fixed in the stackhpc.os-ironic-nodes role version 1.3.1.

Using --no-cache-dir flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.

Using --no-cache-dir flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.

Using --no-cache-dir flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.

Using --no-cache-dir flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages

Using ""--no-cache-dir"" flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.

Using --no-cache-dir flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages

The previous uwsgi invocation assumed that the uwsgi binary is in the
same directory as the project binaries are installed into (probably
/usr/bin).  That may not be correct -- for example if using a packaged
uwsgi on Fedora the binary will live in /usr/sbin/uwsgi (not /usr/bin
where the project files from pip are).

Switch the invocation to just find it in the path.

Additionally, grenade is disabled, otherwise we cannot land this change
without fixing stable branches first.

Switch to openstackdocstheme 2.2.1 version. Using
this version will allow especially:
* Linking from HTML to PDF document
* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_version to not auto-version the documents.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

Switch over to using the new simplestreams snap instead of using
the largely unmaintained packaging in distro (and various PPA's).

This drops direct integration with the simplestreams codebase
in preference to just calling the sstream-mirror-glance command
with the correct parameters.

This commit includes refactoring of 'custom_properties' handling
which was actually broken - there was no loading of the yaml
formatted list, which was probably overkill, so the option now
takes a space separated list of key=value pairs, for example:

 custom_properties=""hw_firmware_type=uefi hw_vif_multiqueue_enabled=true""

Fix version comparison in script wrapper.

Drop Trusty support - snaps on Trusty are awkward requiring new
kernel versions and trusty support was only retained for upgrade
purposes anyway.

Drop unsupported Xenial OpenStack versions.

Fixup CA cert handling to use any charm installed CA cert (including
that provided via the certificates relation) and install cert
to snap compatible location for simplestreams to use.

Add basic action to perform image sync on demand an refactor
the glance simplestreams sync wrapper to work within a hook
context to support the action.

Disable automatic scheduling of image syncs by default as this
tends to be racey during deployment resulting in images being
synced to glance unit local storage.

Add bionic-ussuri bundle and make it the default smoke test.

Deprecate source and key options - no longer required for
deployment with snap.

During an upgrade from Stein to Train, Kolla Ansible fails while running
TASK [cinder : Running Cinder online schema migration]

This is because the `--max_count 10` option is used, which returns 1
while migrations are processed. According to the upgrade documentation,
the command should be rerun while the exit status is 1:
https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/train/upgrade.html

This issue was introduced by a change to the image [1] which fixed a bug
in the way that the max count was interpreted, but exposed an issue in
using the max count.

This change fixes the issue by ceasing to pass MAX_NUMBER, which will
cause all migrations to occur in a single pass.

Using ""--no-cache-dir"" flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.

This parameter is always provided to and required by virt drivers in the tree,
yet it is defined as a kwarg (probably erroneously for compatibility reasons).
However, this puts further additions in a weird spot where it seems like the
right thing to do is add subsequent parameters to the end, forcing them to
be kwargs as well.

As evidenced by the fact that no non-virt code or tests need to be changed to
account for this, there is no reason we need this parameter to be a kwarg.

Recently a patch [1] was merged to stop adding the octavia user to the
admin project, and remove it on upgrade. However, the octavia
configuration was not updated to use the service project, causing load
balancer creation to fail.

There is also an issue for existing deployments in simply switching to
the service project. While existing load balancers appear to continue to
work, creating new load balancers fails due to the security group
belonging to the admin project. At a minimum, the deployer needs to
create a security group in the service project, and update
'octavia_amp_secgroup_list' to match its ID. Ideally the flavor and
network would also be recreated in the service project, although this
does not seem to impact operation and will result in downtime for
existing Amphorae.

This change adds a new variable, 'octavia_service_auth_project', that
can be used to set the project. The default in Ussuri is 'service',
switching to the new behaviour. For backports of this patch it should be
switched to 'admin' to maintain compatibility.

If a deployer sets 'octavia_service_auth_project' to 'admin', the
octavia user will be assigned the admin role in the admin project, as
was done previously.

STATIC_ROOT in local_settings.py should be configured
to path which is also configured in apache's config.

For debian, ubuntu binary setup it is
/var/lib/openstack-dashboard/static.

Reason why it is ""accidentaly"" working is:

For debian package:
Package is overriding STATIC_ROOT in
/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings.d/_0003_debian_static_root.py.
But this is going to be removed from settings in
https://review.opendev.org/733607.

For ubuntu package:
Ubuntu package is adding patch to package which is including
PYTHON_PATH do /usr/share/openstack-dashboard/
And also they are creating several dirty symlinks to get it working.

This patch is fixing this behaviour more clearly.

Various kolla-ansible TLS features (including backend TLS and custom CA
certs) require certificates to be passed via
$KOLLA_CONFIG_PATH/certificates/. Currently Kayobe does not support
this.

This change adds support for copying across files from
$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/kolla/certificates.

It also uses the kolla-ansible default value for
kolla_external_fqdn_cert and kolla_internal_fqdn_cert when
kolla_external_tls_cert and kolla_internal_tls_cert are respectively
not set. This allows for the standard kolla-ansible configuration
approach of dropping these certificates into the
$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/kolla/certificates directory, rather than defining
them as variables. This can be useful if using the kolla-ansible
certificates command to generate certificates for testing.

This patch removes OPAE driver package from cyborg-agent dependencies due to
the following reasons:

1. In the kolla cyborg-agent image we install OPAE, but OPAE is not
available for CentOS 8 for the moment. This will make the cyborg-agent image
unbuildable in Ussuri[0].

2. In devstack, due to the fact that OPAE packages depend on libjson0, which
is not available after Ubuntu 16.04, so cyborg can't be installed on Ubuntu
higher than 16.04 now(unless disable dependency manually). Moreover,from
cyborg's perspective, it does not need to contain any hardware driver
dependency, we can assume the admin should know about it and install the
correct version.

3. We had an agreement at Victoria PTG that we should remove.[1]

We need shared Neutron security group and its members, used
as remote group for other security groups, in order to perform
some security groups scenarios.

Remote security groups with port ranges are complex scenarios with,
depended on the SDN solution, we can observe many bootlenecks.

This patch adds two new Neutron Contexts.

""Remote Security Group"" context that is responsible for:
* creating remote security group
* creating ports in this security group
* binds the ports to one or a few more VMs in order to make those ports
  ACTIVE in Neutron.

""Remote Security Group Rules"" Neutron context is responsible for:
* Creating rules that are linked to Remote Security Group created
  by ""Remote Security Group"" context. Those rules reflects rules
  created by this openstack client command:

openstack security group rule create

During an upgrade from Stein to Train, Kolla Ansible fails while running
TASK [cinder : Running Cinder online schema migration]

This is because the `--max_count 10` option is used, which returns 1
while migrations are processed. According to the upgrade documentation,
the command should be rerun while the exit status is 1:
https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/train/upgrade.html

This issue was introduced by a change to the image [1] which fixed a bug
in the way that the max count was interpreted, but exposed an issue in
using the max count.

This change fixes the issue by ceasing to pass MAX_NUMBER, which will
cause all migrations to occur in a single pass.

Currently OSDs are added by the ceph-osd chart with zero weight
and they get reweighted to proper weights in the ceph-client chart
after all OSDs have been deployed. This causes a problem when a
deployment is partially completed and additional OSDs are added
later. In this case the ceph-client chart has already run and the
new OSDs don't ever get weighted correctly. This change weights
OSDs properly as they are deployed instead. As noted in the
script, the noin flag may be set during the deployment to prevent
rebalancing as OSDs are added if necessary.

Added the ability to set and unset Ceph cluster flags in the
ceph-client chart.

Now that releases are systematically proposed for deliverables with
changes at the end of a cycle, the cycle-automatic release model is
really better described with cycle-with-intermediary combined with
the 'stable-branch-type: none' option.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect
rule on releases.openstack.org so that anyone working on this branch
will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/ussuri branch, tests will
continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

After fixing the uwsgi installation from source that was broken[1][2],
Manila jobs started to fail since no uwsgi wasn't found in the
expected path. This fix now uses 'which' command to search for
uwsgi pathnames in the system.
