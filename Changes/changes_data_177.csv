The agent command exec model is based upon an incoming
heartbeat, however heartbeats are independent and
commands can take a long time. For example, software RAID
setup in CI can encounter this.

From an IPA log:

    'sha512', 'os_hash_value':<trimed>

This was with code built on master, using master images.
Inside the conductor log, it notes that it is likely an out
of date agent because only AgentAPIError is evaluated,
however any API error is evaluated this way. In reality, we need
to explicitly flag *when* we have an error that is because
we've tried to soon as something is already being worked upon.

The result, is to evaluate and return an exception indicating work
is already in flight.

Update - It looks like, the original fix to prevent busy agent
recognition did not fully detect all cases as getting steps is a
command which can
get skipped by accident with a busy agent, under certain circumstances.
Change I5d86878b5ed6142ed2630adee78c0867c49b663f in ironic-python-agent
also changed the string that was being checked for the previous
handling, where we really should have just made the string we were
checking lower case in ironic. Oh well! This should fix things
right up.

Users are experiencing timeout issues in certain environments, mostly
when volumes are too big (ie. multi-terabyte volumes), due to poor
network performance or upgrade issues that revolve around the SolidFire
cluster. A viable solution is to make driver timeout values
configurable in cinder.conf, so users can set these timeouts
according to their needs.

This patch adds two timeout settings to the SolidFire driver
(for cloning operation and globally to all api requests), to
allow users to set the appropriate timeouts for their environment.

In RULES_INGRESS_TABLE table 82 there is a rule for allow established and
related connections. The current rule sends the packet directly to the dest
port without doing a mac learning. This is causing ovs to age out the dest mac
of the remote VM and causing the rule to be changed in flood rule. For the normal
case it fine as they try to avoid high cpu. ovs hardware offload reduce cpu usage
by moving some of the packet processing to nic and flood rule is not offloaded,
therefore it prefre to use the NORMAL action to avoid the flood rule.
We also keep the same logic as today when using explicitly_egress_direct=True
which avoid NORMAL action in the entire pipeline.

python-ovs transparently handles DB reconnections during calls to
Idl.run(). Since ovsdbapp uses a separate thread for the
Connection (so it can handle responding to OVSDB keep-alive echo
requests) and for processing RowEvent notifcations, it is possible
that a thread could be trying to access OVSDB data at the same
time that the Connection thread is updating it. Especially during
a reconnect where the in-memory copy of the DB will be completely
re-written, this causes a problem.

Theoretically, an application that uses ovsdbapp shouldn't access
anything in the backend code directly, but since there is now only
one supported Backend, that restriction has slipped a bit. If
all accesses were in Command objects, mostly there wouldn't be a
problem as they would be handled in the Connection thread. But
with both ReadOnlyCommands and use of lookup() and anything in
idlutils, the main thread can access the in-memory db directly and
potentially cause problems.

The most common problematic method to be called outside of Command
objects is lookup() and ReadOnlyCommands. This patch adds a lock
around calls to idl.run() and lookup() and execute() for the
ReadOnlyCommand case. row_by_value() is another target, but it is
left untouched because it doesn't have access to the API instance
and it is *mostly* called from inside Command objects. User code
that doesn't will be easy to find because user code basically
shouldn't use idlutils.

Rework the makedirs() util for simpler idempotency. Remove the
returned value since it has never been used. Add optional mode to
apply it for the target dir path. That is done via sudo privelege
escalation imported from oslo.privsep.

When the mode is set for the makedirs() call, like when managing the
cached ansible facts dirs, the 'sudo chmod a+rwxt' will be applied
(with a sticky bit) for that path. That fixes issues of accsessing
cached ansible facts for consequent non-privileged CLI commands after
it had been originally created with some sudoed CLI.

When the mode argument was not passed, makedirs only does the best
to create the asked path.

Wait for the loadbalancer to become ACTIVE after deleting an
healthmonitor or a listener, to ensure the next test uses a LB in a
non-transitional state.

This also fixes the cidrs tests that were using the wrong waiter
timeouts.

This patch also moves individual deletion of children resources in class
tear down to a more performant way by cascade deleting the load
balancer.

Row objects are inherently tied to the transaction processing of the Idl.
This means that if you have a reference to a Row in one thread, and
another thread starts a transaction that modifies that row, the Row can
change w/o you knowing it. This is especially noticeable when using the
RowEventHandler. It is possible for a Row that is passed to notify() by
the Idl class to change between being matched and the RowEvent.run()
method being called.

This patch returns an immutable representation of the row by using the
same class that custom indexes use for searching. This should be safe
to pass to other threads.

The allowed_cidrs value could be an empty list if the
request involves the sdk, so change the check to
account for that.

Also had to set not_implemented_is_error to False
so we correctly skip tests with options the driver
does not support.

NOTE: This code is being added due to the recent addition
of an octavia-tempest-plugin test that could cause a
failure because the provider driver doesn't support this
option yet.

policies can only check the creator of the container, if the consumer
controller provides the container project_id and creator_id attributes to the
policy checker.

When building devstack with barbican there is no need for the
functional test users and roles.

This CR will add a single script for creating those users
and roles, and that script can be called upon when needed
(for example from functionaltests/run_tests.sh and
run_tests_parallel.sh)

The pymemcache lib was updated recently in upper-constraints to 3.4.0
and since then the ironic-inspector-tempest-managed-non-standalone job
has been broken.
There seems to be an issue between tooz memcache driver and pymemcache,
the change in upper-constraints has been reverted [1] and the failing
version blacklisted in global-requirements.
Re-enabling ironic-inspector-tempest-managed-non-standalone as it

OpenStack-Helm charts all have a dependency on helm-toolkit, a chart in
openstack-helm-infra. This dependency presents a challenge when
deploying OSH charts using the Helm Operator, as it is unable to resolve
the dependency using the hard-coded localhost address in the charts'

This commit introduces the first change to introduce Airship's
helm-chart-collator [0], a service that provides a Helm chart repository
within a Kubernetes cluster. When packaging charts, the
helm-chart-collator can resolve git dependencies, enabling proper OSH
chart and helm-toolkit packaging. Additionally, the Helm Operator can
deploy charts from Helm chart repositories. Since a helm-chart-collator
image needs to be built at testing time to use the latest OSH charts,
this commit adds a Docker registry to the Kubernetes cluster in order to
host the helm-chart-collator image during continuous-integration jobs.

NOTE: the docker-registry and helm-chart-collator functions will NOT be
included the final openstack composite produced by this repository. They
are solely intended for use during continuous-integration jobs.

When executing 'cinder-manage cluster remove' script, an error occurs in

The cause is that the call 'fetch_func_args(fn)' is trying to fetch
value of argument 'cluster_name' of fn from CONF.cluster_name, but
corresponding argument registered in CONF is 'cluster-name' actually.

We fix this bug by changing argument name registered in CONF, if
positional argument contains '-':
1.put it into automatic conversion from '- to '_', so that keep it the
 same name as handler function argument.
2.add metavar if it doesn't already exist, and it will maintain the help

python-ovs transparently handles DB reconnections during calls to
Idl.run(). Since ovsdbapp uses a separate thread for the
Connection (so it can handle responding to OVSDB keep-alive echo
requests) and for processing RowEvent notifcations, it is possible
that a thread could be trying to access OVSDB data at the same
time that the Connection thread is updating it. Especially during
a reconnect where the in-memory copy of the DB will be completely
re-written, this causes a problem.

Theoretically, an application that uses ovsdbapp shouldn't access
anything in the backend code directly, but since there is now only
one supported Backend, that restriction has slipped a bit. If
all accesses were in Command objects, mostly there wouldn't be a
problem as they would be handled in the Connection thread. But
with both ReadOnlyCommands and use of lookup() and anything in
idlutils, the main thread can access the in-memory db directly and
potentially cause problems.

The most common problematic method to be called outside of Command
objects is lookup() and ReadOnlyCommands. This patch adds a lock
around calls to idl.run() and lookup() and execute() for the
ReadOnlyCommand case. row_by_value() is another target, but it is
left untouched because it doesn't have access to the API instance
and it is *mostly* called from inside Command objects. User code
that doesn't will be easy to find because user code basically
shouldn't use idlutils.

Currently memcache only listens to the internal_api IP. We want to
make it listen to both localhost and internal_api IP because in the
future some services on some roles may want to just use the localhost
memcached instance instead of the using multiple memcached servers
over the network as it is the case currently.

As suggested by Takashi we check the ip version in MemcachedNetwork
in order to decide if we should listen to ::1 or 127.0.0.1

It seems the shell.run_sql(""RESTART"") is not necessary. This change

The scenario configuration in openstack_auth test_auth was ignored
somehow. Perhaps it happened when openstack_auth was merged into
the horizon repo as test runners used in the horizon repo so far
(django test runner, nose and pytest) do not support testscenarios.

This commit tries to recover the original intention of the scenario.
pytest supports several ways to parametrize tests [1]
but there seems no way without changing each test functions.
A quick port of ""testscenarios"" is explained [2],
but it is just a way to generate tests based on scenarios and
we still need to add scenario parameters to each test function,
so we cannot refer scenario parameters in setUp().
As a result, I chose a way to inherit the original class and
pass different attributes per scenario.
This is not ideal and I hope pytest lovers can improve the situation.

The test classes in test_auth are renamed to more meaningful ones.

Direct overrides of settings in test_auth.py are improved too.

- When changing a password and the requirements were not met, the window

- When creating a user and the password does not meet requirements, it

- When checking the logs, these errors would be not be shown.

Due to issue described in related bug report, it seems that it may
happen sometimes that tempest will start trying to ssh to the instance
before ssh key will be really configured in the instance and in such
case it may happened that there will be AuthenticationFailure error
always there. Even if ssh key will be configured properly later during
the test.

To workaround that issue and avoid failures of tests, this patch adds
check if the vm is really booted and ready to ssh. It is done by
checking console log of the VM and looking for specific string ""login:""
which appears at least in case of Cirros and Ubuntu images used in our
CI jobs.
In case when such string will not be found, test will continue to run
and will still try to ssh to the instance. So in worst case it may slow
ssh to the instance a bit but shouldn't really have any bad impact on
test as before this patch it would probably also wait similar amount of
time but on trying to SSH to the instance.

The config section [keystone_auth] is used for service user, which is
different from [keystone_authtoken]. They used to be managed in the same
class, but after the deprecation in Change
I0cea57dd58b4ddc532ee28a045ec4b75b8312919, magnum can no longer fall
back to use the values in keystone_authtoken/admin_user [1]

We add a new class to manage [keystone_auth] of the config, to keep it
distinct from keystone_authtoken

OpenStack. The OpenStack composite will serve as a releasable collection

Kustomize [1] and the Helm Operator [2]. Additionally, the
OpenStack-Helm composite can be used as a Kustomize entrypoint for
Airship, enabling operators to deploy OpenStack-Helm using airshipctl
[3].

The location code was created to allow for emergency relocation of
meetings, however in a virtual setting that is tracked using the ""url""
feature. When location and urls differ it can create a lot of confusion.

It's better to stop displaying location for virtual PTGs. As an
emergency fix, let's stop displaying the location.

The standalone job at present has a high chance of failure
due to two separate things occuring:

1) The deployed nodes from raid tests can be left in a dirty state
   as the raid configuration remains and is chosen as the root
   device for the next deployment. IF this is chosen by any job,
   such as rescue or a deployment test that attempts to login,
   then the job fails with unable to ssh. The fix for this is
   in the ironic-tempest-plugin but we need to get other fixes
   into stablilize the gate first.
   https://review.opendev.org/#/c/757141/
2) Long running scenarios run in cleaning such as deployment with
   RAID in the standalone suite can encounter conditions where
   the conductor tries to send the next command along before the
   present configuration command has completed. An example is
   downloading the image is still running, while a heartbeat
   has occured in the background and the conductor then seeks
   to perform a second action. This then causes the entire
   deployment to fail, even though it was transitory.
   This should be a relatively easy fix.

There are certain HA clustered services (e.g. galera) that don't
have the ability natively to reload their TLS certificate without
being restarted. If too many replicas are restarted concurrently
this might result in full service disruption.

To ensure service availability, provide a means to ensure that
only one service replica is restarted at a time in the cluster.
This works by using pacemaker's CIB to implement a cluster-wide
restart lock for a service. The lock has a TTL so it's guaranteed
to be eventually released without requiring complex contingency
cleanup in case of failures.

Tested locally by running the following:
1. force recreate certificate on all nodes at once for galera
   (ipa-cert resubmit -i mysql), and verify that the resources
   restart one after the other

2. create a lock manually in pacemaker, recreate certificate for
   galera on all nodes, and verify that no resource is restarted
   before the manually created lock expires.

3. create a lock manually, let it expires, recreate a certificate,
   and verify that the resource is restarted appropriately and the
   lock gets cleaned up from pacemaker once the restart finished.

I668643c836d46a25df46d4c99a973af5e50a39db attempted to fix service wide

While this excluded libvirtError it can include internal libvirt-python
classes pointed to by private globals that have been introduced with the
use of type checking within the module.

Any attempt to wrap these internal classes will result in the failure
seen in bug #1901383. As a result this change simply ignores any class
found during inspection that doesn't start with the `vir` string, used
by libvirt to denote public methods and classes.

The standalone job at present has a high chance of failure
due to two separate things occuring:

1) The deployed nodes from raid tests can be left in a dirty state
   as the raid configuration remains and is chosen as the root
   device for the next deployment. IF this is chosen by any job,
   such as rescue or a deployment test that attempts to login,
   then the job fails with unable to ssh. The fix for this is
   in the ironic-tempest-plugin but we need to get other fixes
   into stablilize the gate first.
   https://review.opendev.org/#/c/757141/
2) Long running scenarios run in cleaning such as deployment with
   RAID in the standalone suite can encounter conditions where
   the conductor tries to send the next command along before the
   present configuration command has completed. An example is
   downloading the image is still running, while a heartbeat
   has occured in the background and the conductor then seeks
   to perform a second action. This then causes the entire
   deployment to fail, even though it was transitory.
   This should be a relatively easy fix.

Magnum cluster deletion is not behaving as expected. While it appears to
delete successfully, _delete_complete routine in
magnum/drivers/heat/driver.py is never called because the status of
nodegroups have not had the chance to sync with Heat before
_check_delete_complete is called. As a result, for example, trustee user
accounts are left orphaned. This PS changes or order of activities so
that _delete_complete is invoked successfully.

The current implementation of create_cloned_volume calls flatten
directly, and this makes whole thread of cinder-volume blocked by that
flatten call. This causes heartbeat timeout in RabbitMQ when cloning
a volume with rbd backend.

This patch makes sure that flatten is executed in a different thread,
to allow heatbeat thread to run while flattening a rbd image.

When a non user calls revert to snapshot using the snapshot name the
client returns a failure status:

  $ cinder --os-volume-api-version 3.59 revert-to-snapshot snap1
    ERROR: No snapshot with a name or ID of 'snap1' exists.

The revert to snapshot API requires an UUID, so the cinderclient lists
the snapshots passing ""all_tenants=1"" and the name of the snapshot to
find its first when it's not a UUID.

The problem that we were only removing the ""all_tenants"" filter for
admins, leaving it for normal users and passing it to the DB which
wouldn't understand that filter and return None.

This patch ensure we always remove the ""all_tenants"" filter (as we do in
other places) before calling the OVO method to list snapshots.

The puppet and ansible tasks for deploying the Multipathd service have
been moved to a new tripleo_multipathd ansible role. THT uses that role
passing in parameter values via ansible variables.

Two new THT parameters are supported:
- MultipathdCustomConfigFile provides a way for the user to specify a
  custom multipath.conf file. This makes it easier for the user to
  manage custom settings that are unique to their deployment, such as
  vendor specific hardware tuning.
- MultipathdSkipKpartx provides a means for overriding multipathd's
  default behavior whereby it automatically creates disk partitions on
  multipath devices. Partitions should be managed by VM servers accessing
  the device, not by the overcloud host itself.

The current implementation of create_cloned_volume calls flatten
directly, and this makes whole thread of cinder-volume blocked by that
flatten call. This causes heartbeat timeout in RabbitMQ when cloning
a volume with rbd backend.

This patch makes sure that flatten is executed in a different thread,
to allow heatbeat thread to run while flattening a rbd image.

The fix moves the legacy shared volume from the masking view
structure in Ocata and sooner (when SMI-S was supported) to staging
masking view(s) in Pike and later releases (U4P REST).
In Ocata, the live migration process shared the storage group,
containing the volume, among the different compute Nodes. In PIke,
we changed the masking view structure to facilitate a cleaner live
migration process where only the volume is migrated and not all the
other volumes in the storage group. The staging storage group and
masking views facilitate a seamless live migration operation in
upgraded releases.

Apparently those changes merged a bit after the validation was moved,

The fix moves the legacy shared volume from the masking view
structure in Ocata and sooner (when SMI-S was supported) to staging
masking view(s) in Pike and later releases (U4P REST).
In Ocata, the live migration process shared the storage group,
containing the volume, among the different compute Nodes. In PIke,
we changed the masking view structure to facilitate a cleaner live
migration process where only the volume is migrated and not all the
other volumes in the storage group. The staging storage group and
masking views facilitate a seamless live migration operation in
upgraded releases.

Due to a characteristic on ONTAP devices, the volume extend
operation has a max resize size limited by underlying LUN's
geometry, so the support for extend online volumes was
disabled.

This patch fixes it by allowing a volume (attached or not)
to be extended up to 16TB, which is the max LUN size
supported by ONTAP.

NFS online_extend_support is still disabled due to a bug [0]
found on the generic implementation for NFS driver, which
ONTAP NFS driver relies on.

The interface used to track the previous request by keeping a
copy in the ops db using self._stored.broker_req. But every time
the charm adds an op to the broker request self._stored.broker_req
is updated, so the self._stored.broker_req no longer matches what
the charm sent down the relation at the end of the last hook
execution. To fix this the interface now loads all existing
broker requests into self.previous_requests which is a dictionary
keyed on the request id. The interface can then build up the
new request using self.new_request. Because the interface has
no explicit commit or send method the interface can never know
when an op is added whether its the final op of the request so
it updates the relation every time an op is added. If
self.new_request is functionally equivalent to the previous
request in self.previous_requests then the previous request
is restored to ensure that the hook execution is a noop from
a relation data perspective.

Drive by fixes included:

* self.model is an alias for self.framework.model so use it.
* remove calls to self.model.get_relation as it explodes
  when there are multiple ceph-client relations.

There is code in tripleo-ansible [1] which will look at if user
customized the CephAnsiblePlaybook to run and, if so, will always
use that instead of the special playbook we intend to use on
_systemd or _fstobs tags.

This change will reset param value to its default on FFU
prepare so that we actually trigger the special playbooks later
on in the process, whichever custom setting operators might
have set via CephAnsiblePlaybook param for their Queens deployment.
