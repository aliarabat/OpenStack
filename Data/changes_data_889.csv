When running with virthost == localhost the ssh.config.ansible
is not valid as it's trying to proxy through the localhost.
This is fixed in the ansible-role-tripleo-inventory role.
Changing the ironic.conf file on the undercloud must come
after there is a valid ssh config file in all scenarios.
It's safe to move this to the first step in the tripleo/undercloud

There are two methods for setting up RabbitMQ HA:

 1. Configure rabbit_hosts to multi rabbit hosts.
 2. Setting up a loadbalancer in front of RabbitMQ cluster,
    provide a unique address in rabbit_host

In current, rabbit_ha_queues option is controled by rabbit_hosts IF
conditional statement. But when users want to use the second method:
changing rabbit_ha_queues to true, but they don't use rabbit_hosts
option, this logic will not work.

This patch adds an rabbit_ha_queues option, set it to undef by
default for forward compatbility.

the next stages of work are a bit more obvious.

* 400 badRequest is required anywhere, as that's what you'll get if

* 503 does not happen as there's no application controlled proxying
  in this api
* the URL for listing cells with details was incorrect
* the example response for cells with details was an empty list,
  this is now a todo suggesting an as yet non-existent file
* capacities was not listed, now is
* not clear what capacities really are, so a TODO
* creating a new cell (via POST) was not there, so that is now added
  as a method
* for that POST, request and response bodies, parameters currently a
  TODO
* Update (PUT) and DELETE of a cell has been added, but details are TODO

The inventory and allocations tables are moved to the API database (and
eventually will move to the placement DB). The online data migration
work done for moving the inventory fields from compute_nodes into
inventories is not going to be done via the object model. Instead, we
have agreed to have the nova-compute's resource tracker call the new
resource-providers REST API (the placement API introduced in the
generic-resource-pools spec) and populate the resource-providers schema
that way.

This reverts all the complicated database joins that were introduced
when we thought that inventories and allocations tables would exist in
the cell DB and in the process ""fixes"" LP bug 1572555 by reverting the
compute_node_statistics() method to not look at the inventories or
allocations tables.

This change registers a ""dot"" formatter for the stack resource list
command. It generates the text for a graphviz dot diagram which can be
rendered as an image with this example usage:

  openstack stack resource list --format dot -n3 my_stack | dot -Tsvg -o my_stack.svg

Nested resources are fully supported by creating nodes for top-level
resources then linking stack resources to a subgraph representing the
nested stack.

This begins work toward moving the devstack code to a devstack plugin within
heat tree. This allows us to experiment with the devstack code more easily,
as well as take some load off of the devstack team.
Note that the plugin is not enabled until we enable it in project-config,
so this doesn't actually affect devstack runs yet. The files that exist in
devstack are listed below.

$ find . -name *heat*

https://review.openstack.org/#/c/323623/ added a few new defaults to the
Launch Instance but didn't add any tests, so the backport is blocked on
coverage. Rather than lower coverage, we should just add the tests and
squash the two commits in the backport.

Fastest way to verify is to generate coverage in master, look at the
lines added by https://review.openstack.org/#/c/323623/ (red) then apply
this patch and run again. You'll see they are all white.

Richard, this is an example of how you can achieve what I believe you want
via just basic Bootstrap.  Rather than having multiple conditionals based
on span counts, you can just let Bootstrap do its own wrapping.  If you want
items to be on multiple lines, then just use the action/search spans of 12.
Otherwise just configure the proportion that you want within the row grid.

Many of the pollsters define the timestamp individually for each
generated sample, which should really be timestamping based on when
the data was polled and not when each sample is generated. We need to
set the timestamp of the polled data to the timestamp when the polling
starts for unity.

Previous commit be3f7fb8300e8853ebd35986cdf159422aa247a already unified
the timestamp in samples, and now drop the timestamping in pollsters.

Nova can fill up the partition that /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save is on
when nova calls `image-create` on an instance.  This occurs because
nova calls libvirt with managedsave which creates a temporary file in
the /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save location.  Libvirt does not allow the
location of /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save to be configurable so we have
to manage it ourselves via bindmounts or symlinks.

In this commit we remove the /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save directory and
create a symlink in it's place, pointing to
`{{ nova_system_home_folder }}/save` instead (which we also create).
This location was chosen as deployers often have more space here for
nova instances.

Currently the key id saved in X-Object-Sysmeta-Crypto-Id is only set
during a PUT request. The sysmeta cannot be set by a POST request. The
key id value is the path used to derive keys and is currently used by
the keymaster to determine what keys should be for decrypter to use in
the GET path. So if we have an object that was PUT without crypto and
then POSTed to with crypto, we have no X-Object-Sysmeta-Crypto-Id
value to derive keys from and cannot therefore decrypt the POSTed
metadata.

We do not actually need to use X-Object-Sysmeta-Crypto-Id to derive
keys - objects do not change location. So in this patch we stop using
it for key derivation in the GET and HEAD paths and instead just use
the path of the GET/HEAD request.

The key id may prove useful in the future if for example an object
were ever relocated, or a keymaster chose a different key with
different id for a POST vs the original PUT. If that were to happen
then we could use the persisted key id to inform the keymaster as to
which key is required for decryption.

For such future-proofing this patch changes the location for
persisting the key id to the crypto_meta dicts for each encrypted
item, and no longer uses the X-Object-Sysmeta-Crypto-Id header. That
way, if ever a different key id were used by a keymaster for a POST vs a
PUT then we'd have the right value stored with the metadata
crypto-meta vs the data crypto-meta.

To enable that, the keymaster now includes the key id in the dict of
results returned from fetch_crypto_keys, so that the encrypter can
embed the key id in crypto meta. The key id is also changed to be a
dict that contains the key derivation path and also a version number
for the keymaster. This is purely for future-proofing - we now persist
sufficient information in crypto-meta to determine which keymaster
version was used and how it derived the keys.

This changes also allows some simplification of the keymaster, and now
the keymaster only calculates keys when they are asked for by a call
to fetch_keys.

In addition, the keymaster will never set the 'swift.crypto.override'
flag anymore. There are still encrypter and decrypter unit tests to
handle the case where somebody uses such a keymaster, but this one
will not make use of that flag.

Apparently, the disks which're bigger than 2T were excluded from list
of bootable disks if possible. Just because in the past, those disks
were unrecognized by BIOS (or UEFI under CSM).

In fact, it was just misconfiguration of RAID controller or BIOS
itself.

GRUB uses BIOS INT13h in order to find all available disks.
Therefore, unless particular disk is not configured as 'bootable',
there's no change for GRUB to find it.

One should configure hardware in the following way assuming that
the first disk (hd0) is bootable and is used for operating system
purposes.
In case of hardware RAID, FC multipath or any other HBA, the disk
(or lun, or whatever) which was configured as 'bootable' will be
reported as hd0 via INT13h. So, GRUB will be able to boot from it.

When building ovs from git, branch-2.5 is the default branch.
But this branch does not support make targe 'rpm-fedora'.

This bug change the default branch to master, which supports
'rpm-fedora',though it can be unstable. People can change it
to other stable branch in local.conf if they want.

This reverts commit d894221457efa3a2a0bf3db76a4c5e8ffba36e29.

The change broke networking-midonet, which uses neutron-legacy.

Actually, Q_L3_ENABLED=True and is_service_enabled q-l3 have
quite different meaning.
The former means the plugin provides L3 functionalities.
The latter means Neutron L3 agent is enabled.
MidoNet provides L3 functionalities without using Neutron L3 agent.

Intial testing of convergence indicates it increases the memory
usage and stress on the DB, so it's probably best if we explicitly
disable it seeing as Heat plans to enable it by default soon.

We can perhaps wire in an experimental CI job that overrides this
so that we can evaluate if/when is a good time to switch to the
new architecture (it gives us less benefits than many environments
because we only use a single node undercloud)

There is a cases for node, when $.nodes.uid doesn't changed but
task should be ran. One of this cases is cluster reinstallation
after successful deploy, cause in this case all $.nodes metadata
stays the same as it were after cluster deployment, but nodes are
really destroyed and reprovisioned and as a result tasks must be
ran again. But cluster status in this case _will_ be changed, so
it is better to use it in expression.

If some messages in Redis are already expired, it's impossible to claim
any new messages.

Zaqar internally catches this error from running ""claim_messages.lua"":
""ResponseError: Error running script: @user_script:59: user_script:59:
attempt to compare nil with number"". And returns 503 response code to
the user.

This happens because if some message is expired (it's <message_id>
record was automatically deleted from database), it's ID is still listed
in set ""<project_id>.<queue_name>.messages"" and Zaqar uses this ID. In
this case on attempt to get some values from <message_id>'s fields, it
gets 'nil' values.

This patch makes Zaqar check if returned field values from <message_id>
record are 'nil'. If values are not 'nil', process the record normally.
If values are 'nil', remember message ID. In the end of the script
""claim_messages.lua"" garbage collect all such message IDs, because it's
a good opportunity to do so.

Now,Zaqar will always return ""max_messages_post_size""

So users can't know whether these values are in db or

to update the queue's metadata when these two values are

So we should check them before the queue update action.

The thing is that sometimes we have file system images and mount
point hierachies which are not aligned. Let's say, we have root
file system image, while partition scheme says that two file
systems should be created on the node: / and /var. In this case
root image has /var directory with a set of files. Obviously, we
need to move all these files from /var directory on the root
file system to /var file system because /var directory will be
used as mount point.
In order to achieve this we mount all existent file systems into
a flat set of temporary directories. We then try to find
specific paths which correspond to mount points and move all
files from these paths to corresponding file systems.

Remove configure_default_route task to make network configuration
idempotent for majority of roles. 'Netconfig' task on all
non-controller nodes will be executed after 'virtual_ips' task on
controllers. So there's no need to reconfigure default route.

Only mongo roles still have non-idempotent network configuration
in case of role-based deployment, because mongo nodes are deployed
before controllers and no VIPs are configured yet.

The original example dictionaries added to the RAID documentation
used single quotes instead of double quotes. Since double quotes
are used in JSON, as opposed to dictionaries, to represent a string,
they were failing JSON validation and could not be directly used.

Changed the single quotes to double quotes where appropriate
in the RAID documentation and passed each example through a JSON
validator which now returns that the example is valid JSON.

This patch also updates quotes in cleaning.rst and ilo.rst.

can break Heat-Translator if those changes aren't backward compatible. In

By sourcing the environment files directly into the running process,
dib-run-parts can pollute its own environment.  For example, if an

When processing events from ovsdb monitor, agent checks devices
for which there are both 'added' and 'deleted' events and then looks
for the device in the system to know what event could be omitted.
In some cases event dicts for same port would not be equal:
for example ofports may differ. Thus we should compare device names
rather than dicts.

There are two methods for setting up RabbitMQ HA:

 2. Setting up a loadbalancer in front of RabbitMQ cluster,

In current, rabbit_ha_queues option is controled by rabbit_hosts IF

changing rabbit_ha_queues to true, but they don't use rabbit_hosts
option, this logic will not work.

Method _add_to_threadpool is defined repeated in both cinder.volume.Manager
class and cinder.manager.SchedulerDependentManager class. Actually,
SchedulerDependentManager is the parent class of Manager. Therefore,
there's no need to redefine the method again. This patch removes the
duplicated definition of the method in cinder.volume.Manager.

This fixes an issue where we consider migrations that have been completed
as ""in progress"" by not filtering them out of the result set from
migration_get_in_progress_by_host_and_node(). This adds that state to
the list and adds a migration in that state to the test case. If it
is not filtered, the counts won't line up and the test will fail.

with that of the legacy controllers, in that the pecan controllers

At our Newton design summit in Austin, our community reached a
consensus to narrow the scope of the Magnum project to focus on
integrating container orchestration engines (COEs) with OpenStack,
and making them easy to create, manage, and delete in an OpenStack
cloud with full multi-tenancy support.

API features intended to uniformly create, manage, and delete
individual containers across any COE will be removed from Magnum's
API, and may be re-introduced as a separate project with a new name.

This change is justified by the recognition that we have two distinct
groups of stakeholders who value different goals for different reasons.
Conflation of refining a common COE abstraction, and deep integration
of each COE for native API deployment/management within Magnum has
proven to be problematic. We will solve this conflation by clarifying
a narrow scope for Magnum, and allowing another project to pursue a
common COE abstraction. This allows each group of stakeholders to focus
on their mutual interests.

The futurist executors have functionality that it would be really
nice to take advantage of (such as metrics gathering, being able
to know what lock types will work with that executor and more)
so in order to be able to start depending on those features we
need to deprecate passing the base executor type and prefer the
futurist kind only.

This starts to add that deprecation so that at some point in the
future we can rely on being passed only the futurist types.

As discussed at summit, the version part of the URL is not really
relevant, or a thing a user should be filling out themselves, this
should instead be set by the service catalog and extracted from the
token.

This removes it's reference in all documented REST urls, and adds a
new section describing how one gets the base URL for all calls.
