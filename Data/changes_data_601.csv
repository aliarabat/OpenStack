Right now, there is a constraint in cinder that all backup related
requests should always be sent to the the backup service running on the
same host as the volume service. When a distributed object store like
ceph is used, this constraint is not needed. When multiple cinder-backup
services are setup for high availability(HA), this constraint prevents
load balancing across the available services. When this constraint is
removed, a distributed messenger like ZeroMQ could distribute the load
across all the available services.

Proposal:
Now that cinder supports distributed object store(ceph) backup driver
and distributed messaging(ZeroMQ)
driver(https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1440631), relax the above
said constraint when those distributed systems are used in conjunction.

Currently the NVRAM manager store API takes the instance object as
the paramater, which by itself is just fine. However, the event handler
(virt/powervm/event.py) has to grab the entire Instance object just for
the store method when responding to NVRAM events.

This change makes it so that the NvramManager and Swift APIs take
the instance uuid OR instance object as the parameter. A cache is put
in the event listener to maintain a mapping of the PVM UUID to the
instance object UUID so that the instance object still does not have
to be retrieved on every event.

This patch introduces 3 new configuration options:

They take the same default value oslo.service currently has, 1000.

When a user is not authorized to see a given resource, we need to
convert HTTP 403s into HTTP 404s to avoid giving away information
that the resource exists. However, the previous code was being
overaggressive and doing this conversion even in some cases where
the user is allowed to see the resource and really needs to know
that what they were trying to do is forbidden, not be told that the
resource doesn't exist. This fixes that logic to only do the 403
to 404 conversion when truly appropriate.

Similar to I52428262276c16dbe077fcf77b1890f12dccc97d,
any subnets created with another client were failing to delete
with an HTTPNotFound which was silently ignored. So
we were implicitly depending on deletion of the network to
actually cleanup the subnet.

This adjusts the logic to use the admin_client to delete the subnet
whenever a different client is used.

The keystone OSA rolling-upgrade job defines a
builder and job template which duplicates things
done elsewhere. Instead of duplicating job
config, this patch implements the re-use of
other job config.

This also ensures that the primary checkout for
all openstack-ansible scenario jobs is actually
the openstack-ansible repository, instead of
another repository (eg: dragonflow). This ensures
that the correct tests are activated.

Following the directive
http://governance.openstack.org/reference/new-projects-requirements.html

[1] OpenStack Mission Alignment:

The purpose of the Gluon project is to provide a model-driven,
extensible framework that automates API generation for new NFV
Networking Services across multiple backend SDN Controllers so as to
enable Telco Service Providers to speed up deployment and accelerate
time-to-market.

(1.1) Use cases and requirements for Gluon are described in wiki[1].

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) uses the technologies of IT
virtualization to virtualize entire classes of network node functions
into building blocks that may connect, or chain together, to create
communication services. NFV relies upon, but differs from, traditional
virtualization techniques, such as those used in enterprise IT. For
example, NFV traffic is typically pass-through and high throughput so
that VNF (Virtualized Network Function) can provide high performance
networking function. On the other hand, under the enterprise IT and
cloud environment, traffic is typically terminated at applications.
Networking is rarely a bottleneck, and interoperability and API
stability is key to those SaaS and PaaS.

The key driver of NFV is the need from Telco Service Providers to
accelerate the deployment of new network services to support the
revenue and growth objectives.

Because of the driver and objectives of NFV, which is different from
traditional enterprise IT and cloud, Telco Service Providers have been
providing various NFV platforms globally, for example, AT&T ECOMP,
China Mobile NovoNet, etc., and related open source platform ONAP
(Open Networking Automation Platform).

The key feature that is common to various NFV platform is the separation
of design environment and execution environment. And the key function is
the capability to automate the API generation of new NFV Networking
Services across multiple backend SDN Controllers so as to enable Telco
Service Providers to speed up deployment and accelerate time-to-market.

An Epic User Story is described in wiki[2].

(1.2) The high level design of Gluon is available in Gluon repo[3].

Gluon is composed of the following components:

1) Gluon Component
   Gluon is the port arbiter that maintains a list of ports and bindings
   of different networking backends. The implementation of Gluon is
   currently integrated with Neutron by means of extending Neutron's
   core plugin as a subclass, namely Extended ML2 Plugin for Gluon
   (a.k.a. Gluon Core Plugin). This replaces the original Neutron's core
   plugin in neutron.conf. The Gluon Core Plugin differentiates Proton
   ports from Neutron ports based on a Proton's record in etcd, and
   sends the port binding and other operations requests to either
   Proton Server or its superclass (i.e. the original Neutron's core
   plugin).
2) Proton Server
   A Proton Server is the API server that hosts multiple Protons, i.e.
   multiple sets of APIs.
3) Protons
   A Proton is a set of APIs of a particular NFV Networking Service.
   A Proton is created by Particle Generator based on a YAML file
   modeled for this particular NFV Networking Service. When a Proton is
   created, the objects, database schema, and RESTful APIs of this
   Proton are created. Then the Proton specific driver would be loaded
   into Gluon.
4) Shim Layer and Networking Backends (SDN Controllers)
   A Proton is built to enable the set of APIs for a particular NFV
   Networking service that is supported by one or multiple networking
   backends. One example of a networking backend is Open Daylight but
   support for multiple simultaneous networking backends is a core goal
   of the project. A Shim Layer is created for a networking backend to
   be able to use the Proton. The Shim Layer monitors changes in the
   data model stored in etcd, and performs appropriate actions in the
   respective SDN Controller backend, for instance creating a VPN
   service or binding a port. In an example of using Open Daylight, if
   a bind operation request occurs, the Shim Layer is responsible for
   understanding the request in the data model and updating the Flow
   Entries on the OVS of that particular compute where the Virtual
   Machine resides.
5) Database
   Gluon has its own database to store mappings of Gluon ports with
   network backends, and information and data model of specific Protons.
   In addition, Gluon uses etcd to store necessary information of
   Protons as a way of communication with backend SDN Controllers
   through Shim Layers.

(1.3) Summary of Mission Alignment

From Gluon's use case, high level design and current implementation,
it is quite clear that:
- Gluon is directly building on top of existing OpenStack service
  Neutron via an Extended ML2 Plugin to serve the objective of
  automating API generation for new NFV Networking Services across
  multiple backend SDN Controllers
- The business goal of Gluon is to expand OpenStack's footprint into
  NFV domain and speed up Telco Service Providers' deployment and
  accelerate time-to-market
- Wherever possible, Gluon adopts technologies and patterns used by
  existing OpenStack projects, e.g. Neutron, rather than competing or
  reinventing the wheel. The design and implementation achieves full
  compatibility with Neutron while extending its footprint into NFV
  domain

[2] Following ""the 4 Opens"":

(2.1) Open Source:

- The Gluon project is 100% open source under an Apache 2.0 license[4],
  everything from implementation to design to future features and
  roadmap are happening and shared openly and presented in various
  meet-ups and documents.
- The Gluon has no library dependencies which effectively restrict how
  the project may be distributed or deployed. Oslo libraries are used
  by all components where applicable.

(2.2) Open Community:

- The Gluon leadership is chosen by the contributors to the project in
  an open and public way[5].
- The Gluon project has regular weekly public meetings on IRC[6] and
  those meetings are logged and published[7].
- The Gluon project has provided a level and open collaboration playing
  field for all contributors. We have been working closely with the
  community to share use cases and problems and decide on future
  priorities for the project. It is our mission to collaborate with as
  many members/companies in the community as possible and we welcome
  any feedback and any desire to help us shape Gluon's future. This is
  done using the mailing list, etherpad, IRC, weekly meetings, wikis,
  patches, and OpenStack summit sessions[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]
  [15][16][17][18][19].
- The Gluon project does not benefit any single vendor, or any single
  vendor's product offerings. In fact, because of the nature of NFV
  domain and expected new capability, the Gluon project puts every
  vendor on a level playing field, and encourages all interested
  vendors to work collaboratively in open source environment.
- Because the Gluon project is 100% open source under an Apache 2.0
  License[4], every vendor has the equal access to source code in
  OpenStack repo.
- Because the Gluon project is built on top of existing OpenStack
  service Neutron, there is no proprietary software or technology used,
  or special hardware or other resource required. Everthing can be
  deployed and run on COTS hardware available on open market.
- Contributors of the Gluon are very diversified and come from many
  different companies[20][21][22][23][24].

(2.3) Open Development:

- The Gluon project uses public code reviews in OpenStack Gerrit[25].
- The Gluon project has a core team which openly review and discuss all
  issues[26][27].
- The Gluon project adopts a test-driven gate in the OpenStack Gerrit
  for changes[27][28].
- The Gluon project PTL serves as liaison for the work of cross-project
  teams in OpenStack.
- The Gluon project collaborates with other projects such as Nova and
  Neutron to try to find optimal solution[29][30][31][32].
- The Gluon project adopts technology and patterns used by existing
  OpenStack projects such as Launchpad[33], Gerrit[25], wiki[34], Git
  repo[35].

(2.4) Open Design:

- All designs and specs of the Gluon project are managed by Lauchpad
  Blueprints[36], published for review and documented in OpenStack
  repo[37].
- The Gluon project conducts a weekly IRC meeting to discuss all
  designs and future roadmap[7].
- The Gluon code repository offers documentation and diagrams to
  explain the current design, code and future roadmap[37].
- Everything is discussed openly either on the ML, or the Gluon
  project weekly meeting, or the Design Summit, or etherpad, or other
  public forums.

[3] Ten Month Operating History and One Official Release with Ocata

- The Gluon project has been operating for about 10 months since its
  incubation.
- The Gluon project has participated in Ocata release recycle
- The Gluon project PTL has actively worked with Release Engineering
  team for tagging, cutting stable/ocata branch etc tasks for smooth
  release.

[4] Miscellaneous

- The Gluon project is built on top of OpenStack, and ensures basic
  interoperability with the rest of OpenStack. It adopts RBAC and
  user-facing API services supports Keystone for discovery and
  authentication.
- The Gluon project has an active core team of 6 contributors[26], and
  more than 10 active technical contributors overall[24][38], and
  nearly 30 total contributors in all capacity[38].
- The Gluon project will participate in any goals specified by the TC
  for future releases
- The Gluon project meets any policies that the TC requires all
  projects to meet, e.g. testing.
- The Gluon project expects to participate in all elections held after
  the team is accepted as official, regardless of how recently the
  team leadership may have been established.

When creating a nested stack and pre-storing the raw template, we
previously used a try/finally block to ensure that if the stack creation
was never started (e.g. because the template failed validation at the other
end) that we would delete the raw template again rather than leave it lying
around in the DB. However, this catches too broad a range of exceptions. If
an exception such as GreenletExit occurs inside this block, then we will
attempt to delete the raw template, resulting in a DB IntegrityError either
here (because the template id is already referenced by a stack) or when
trying to store the stack (because the template is gone).

Resolve this by only doing the cleanup on HeatExceptions, which indicates
that the other engine has bailed out without storing the stack.

Turns out this exception is introduced in version 33 of the
websocket library which is not available on some platforms
(rhel 7.x).

Impact on runtime is that if an exception is thrown while connecting
the websocket, the line ""except WebsocketBadStatusException"" will
raise a ValueError, crash everything, AND mask the initial exception.
This change makes the exception reporting slightly less specific but
it is still totally useable.

see: https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/blob/master/ChangeLog

Also, add info logging of websocket status while we're at it

This change implements a discover_image_tag method to discover the
versioned tag for a container image.

The current approach is to expect a label to be set on the image which
contains the expected tag value. For example the RDO image building
pipeline sets a label rdo_version whose value also matches a tag.

This change will be used by the python-tripleoclient change which
actually implements the command
""openstack overcloud container image tag discover"".

In the tempest TestContainer, for e.x [1], we get the container with
model.uuid, then assert it with the desire state. The method
_get_container_state will use docker_client to get container. At that
time, the problem happens, docker client can get only container which
run in master node (the node run tempest), so sometimes it may return
None.

The new strategy is passing docker host get from model (model.hostname)
and pass to docker client. By this way, we can get container in the
specific host.

Update hacking rule to prevent log translation in all log level instead
of only debug level.

Since all log translations are invalidated, check_explicit_underscore_import

DevStack variables Q_PLUGIN_EXTRA_CONF_{PATH|FILES} were deprecated
during the Ocata cycle. Instead, plugins should leverage the
neutron_server_config_add function. The networking-generic-switch
DevStack plugin was updated to use this function in commit
a656b25d037ad250647ae1484e75d9d4633ba373.

Using the deprecated variables is causing installation failures of the
DevStack configuration for Ironic multitenant networking. This patch
stops using them, which solves the installation issues.

If 2 parallel threads simultaneously make an expensive call to a
memoized function with arguments for which the returned value wasn's
cached before, 2 calls are effectively made in parallel.

It's better to avoid such a situation and if one thread already
initiated an expensive call, block on it in another thread and once
the call in the first thread is completed, unblock and reuse the value
which is cached now.

Based on testing against the g-r set of cross checks, which includes
dsvm, grenade, unit and functional tests of glance, cinder, nova, neutron
and swift, these seem to be the lower bounds that are actually coinstallable
and passing all tests.

Currently, we use rbd as the default glance image storage backend.
This patch set adds in job to tests for a single node setup with
radosgw, swift and pvc as the glance backend.

It seems nodes have gotten gradually slower over time,
leading to much higher incidence of time outs (~30%).

Requesting increased limit.

Most of them were neglected and pointed to versions released
a year ago and more, which are typically not installable anymore
(they used to have a pbr<2.0 requirement which is incompatible
with the pbr>=2.0 requirement we enforce globally).

So for all of the openstack affine projects, update to a release
that is less than 4 months old (in some cases even newer versions
were required upon trial and error).

controller-manager pod, which should improve reliability of ceph

untill it hit the right server.
