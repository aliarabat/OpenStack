When a PUT request is made to an EC object the resulting container
update must include the override values for the actual object
etag and size, as opposed to the fragment etag and size. When a POST
request is made the same override values should be included in the
container update, but currently the update includes the incorrect EC
fragment size (but the correct body etag).

This is ok so long as the update for the object PUT request arrives at
the container server first (whether by direct update or replication)
because the etag and size values in an update due to an object POST
will not have a newer timestamp that the PUT and will therefore be
ignored at the container server.

However, if the update due to the object PUT request has not arrived
at the container server when the update due to the object POST
arrives, then the etag and incorrect size sent with the POST update
will be recorded in the container server. If the update due to the PUT
subsequently arrives it will not fix this error because the timestamp
of its etag and size values is not greater than that of the already
recorded values.

Fortunately the correct object body size is persisted with the object
as X-Backend-Container-Update-Override-Size sysmeta so this patch
fixes the container update due to a POST to use that value instead of
the Content-Length metadata.

This makes the keypair object load first from the API database,
falling back to the main database as necessary. Creates happen in the
API database only now.

Since the Instance object uses this object to patch up its keypairs
field on the fly, this adds a localonly parameter to the get method so
that we don't end up with compute nodes calling back up to the API
database in the lazy-load case. Only Instances that were created before
the previous patch will be missing keypair data, and so we're
guaranteed to have their keypairs in the main database (if at all).

doing improperly circumventing the initialization process by relying on
the ResourceTracker.update_available_resource() to populate resource
information in that ComputeNode object.

During force_live_migration operation there are 2
checks of migration status, one on api layer and one on
compute side, second one requires rpc request to be done
and also to query the db. This check could be removed as additional
one doesn't guarantee that live_migration is not already completed,
also is very small window between api and compute side.
Target compute host is now taken from migration object rather
then instance.host field, which allows to guarantee that nova will not
pause already migrated instance.

Users need to mark as reserved some amount of pages for third party
components.

The most common use case for using huge/large pages is NFV. In the
current state of that feature we can't guarantee the necessary amount
of pages to allow OVS-DPDK to run properly on the compute node, which
result in the instance failing to boot on a well selected
compute-node. OVS-DPDK needs 1 GB hugepages reserved. Since Nova does
not take into account that page reserved for OVS-DPDK it results in
the process not being able to acquire the necessary memory which
results in a failed boot.

This commit adds a new option 'reserved_huge_pages' which takes a list
of string format to select on which host NUMA nodes and from which
pagesize we want to reserve a certain amount of pages. It also updates
NUMAPageTopology to contain a reserved memory pages attribute, which
helps compute the available pages size on host for scheduling/claiming
resources.

documentation. As a community, we could do a better
job at catching up with these changes and
documenting our project well enough for the
benefit of all stakeholders.

Add instructions on where to document what and
provide tips to manila developers on documentation.

Mistral gets confused by Trove's (aguably wrong) inclusion
of a member called 'items' in the Pagenated object that
Trove returns as the result of 'list' client methods.

This change changes Pagenated to inherit from the 'list'
class so that the items method is not required (and has
the additional benefit of just generally being a better
implementation of a list type result).

This commit adds the transport_url parameters for oslo.messaging. The
url is of the form:

  transport://user:pass@host1:port[,hostN:portN]/virtual_host

Where the transport scheme specifies the rpc or notification backend
as one of rabbit, amqp, zmq, etc. Oslo.messaging is deprecating the
host, port, and auth configuration options [1]. All drivers will get
these options via the transport_url.

* use oslo::messaging::default resource
* use oslo::messaging::notifications resource

This commit switches the remaining config options to use the
_config_get() method to get a value with a default. This cleans
up the code a bit and also makes the interface for getting
configuration options consistent.

When attempting to allow_access on a managed share, it fails
because the proper share ID is not retrieved from private storage
prior to attempting to validate that the share exists in the
backend. The same happens when trying to create a share from a
snapshot created from a managed share, the proper share ID is
not retrieved from private storage. While we are dealing with
two possible different IDs it is important to properly display
the API share ID in log messages so it can be matched to the
share instances ID, and not all log messages are accurately doing
so.

This change addresses this by retrieving the ID from
private storage first for update_access and
create_share_from_snapshot operations. The proper unit test changes
included in this patch required a refactor of several IDs to ensure
this problem is addressed in unit tests, thus it made sense to
address several bugs caused by the same problem, having the same fix
and requiring modifications to the same lines of code.

Many tests were loading 'horizon.app.core' as part of their setup;
this generally isn't necessary and may be contributing to lots of
overhead in tests.

This patch also moves the general resource registrations out of the
core and into a horizon.app.resources structure, which was one of the
proposed solutions for incorporating registrations anyway.  This will
reduce the overhead of the registrations when using horizon.app.core
which really doesn't need the resource-specific code for any of its
functions anyway.

Currently port details are completed by the mechanism driver before
being written to the journal. This is necessary for communicating with
the ODL controller and proper handling of journal dependencies.

Instead, port details should be completed by the journal logic which
can also handle a case when there is no call context (this is needed
by the full sync mechanism, and might have other usages in the future).

ShareResourceNotFound exception in case share not found during

proper handling of share deletion, thus allowing share to be

as attributes of those clusters would have lack 'deployed_before' field.

Since processing of the flag is temporary solution it should not be

There is an issue if someone uses a non-english locale, that includes
non US-ASCII chars. In that case appending a unicode argument to a
string fails with an error.

This patch refactors the existing test, covering a few more different
cases with english and non-english locales. The last test currently
fails on master with an UnicodeDecodeError; this is fixed by the gettext
decoding.

python-oneviewclient is a library used by Ironic to deal with HPE OneView
managed infrastructure. Since it's used by Ironic, requirements shared by
the two projects should be consistent. This patch addes python-oneviewclient
to projects.txt so it can be updated when the global-requirements changes for
projects.

A bunch of functional tests fail because of non implemented

wrong condition passed to db_find() in OVSFW test.
This patch addresses the issue by implementing lists
comparison in native.idlutils and fixing the call to
db_find() in OVSFW test.

A functional test for OVSDB API's db_find() has been
added to ensure that querying a list column gives the same
result both with vsctl and native ovsdb_interface; unit
test for idlutils.condition_match() with corner cases has
been added as well.

rest_client's expected_success() method expect expected_code
and read_code as int and compare both.

But if read_code is non int then this method will not compare anything
and pass falsely.

condition ""if read_code < 400:"" makes comparision of both status code but
return the results. But if read_code is not int then this condition is
alse and it make this method pass wihtout any compariosion.

It is written in doc string that read_code should be int but if anyone try
to send non int then it might be false pass.

self.expected_success(200, '202') - pass. This is false pass.

read_code is usually a status code return from API which can be fetched as
string via dict element like resp['status'].

Some user tried to access that and faced the issue, one example of this
wrong usage is:

This function is a method of ComputeAPI, so its callers must have an
instance of the class. This make the usage difficult in modules which
do not need to call ComputeAPI by other reason.

Besides this function does not use any of the class members. So there is
no reason for it to be the class method.

This patch moves this function to compute.utils because it does not use
anything of the class members.

This patch also adds support for the _get_root_bdm and
is_volume_backed_instance to read from a dictionary instead of an
Instance object. Because of this we can call is_volume_backed_instance
from build_request_spec and fix bug #1469179.

Nova can fill up the partition that /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save is on
when nova calls `image-create` on an instance.  This occurs because
nova calls libvirt with managedsave which creates a temporary file in
the /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save location.  Libvirt does not allow the
location of /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save to be configurable so we have
to manage it ourselves via bindmounts or symlinks.

In this commit we remove the /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save directory and
create a symlink in it's place, pointing to
`{{ nova_system_home_folder }}/save` instead (which we also create).
This location was chosen as deployers often have more space here for
nova instances.

There was a substantial amount of code in the image cache devoted to
checksumming images. However, these checksums were never used beyond
the generation of a log message during the image cache manager's
periodic task of the form:

  Corrupt base files: ...

This code was expensive to run, added significant complexity to the
image cache manager, and not actually used by anything. This patch
removes it. The only functional change should be that the above log
message is no longer generated.

We can't remove it completely in this pass because the image cache
may be on shared storage with an old compute host which expects these
files to exist. Consequently we retain the code to delete the image
metadata file when deleting an entry from the cache, and we don't

The code in OVSBridgeIntercept was not behaving
as intended:
- the extension cookie was not applied as expected, even
  for the ofctl-based OVSTunnelBridge (interference with
  class inheritance, because __getattr__ does not let us
  override methods existing in a parent class,
  __getattribute__ has to be used instead)
- the extension cookie would never have been applied
  for the native.OVSTunnelBridge that does not use add_flow

This changes corrects the code and adds a test case.

We also now import the neutron constants from neutron-lib.

Trove backups are stored in Swift as Dynamic Large Objects. This is not
ideal, and could cause restore to fail as DLOs may not return all of
their parts. Static Large Objects should be used instead. SLOs perform
checksum and object size validation and can reduce object download times
significantly.

Changes are needed to the Swift storage strategy and taskmanager's
backup delete model to perform actions on SLOs. The corresponding
unittests and fakes are also updated.

A special case occurs when the backup object fits in a single Swift
object segment, in which case it will not be made a SLO.

Currently, the oslo config generator takes glance_store configs in
consideration while generating sample configs for the registry. Registry
doesn't really need these configs.

This patch removes the store config namespace from the oslo
config generator's setup to avoid regeneration of store section in
registry sample.

Sample configs have been regenerated using `tox -e genconfig` command to
make sure they reflect the change proposed. Only the
glance-registry.conf file has been refreshed as a part of this commit.

This patch corrects external snapshot XML generation to get XML
according to the libvirt documentation.
It lets use external snapshot functionality with environments
that have dots in their names. Without this change system tests
fail during snapshot creation.

Tests are modified to reflect changes made in libvirt xml builder
code base as well.

At the moment, when live migration is requested, we attempt to

The issue is that we don't check whether shared storage is being

Presently should the ATA erasure operation fails, IPA halts the
cleaning process and the node goes to CLEANFAIL state as a result.

This failure could be the result of a previous cleaning failure

in an attempt to address this case by attempting to unlock the
the drive.

In the event that an operator wishes to automatically fallback to
disk scrubbing operations, the capability has been added through
a driver_internal_info field ""agent_continue_if_ata_erase_failed""

* Introduced class hierarchies Task and Action used by Mistral engine.
  Note: Action here is a different than executor Action and represents
  rather actions of different types: regular python action, ad-hoc
  action and workflow action (since for task action and workflow are
  polymorphic)
* Refactored task_handler.py and action_handler.py with Task and Action
  hierarchies
* Rebuilt a chain call so that the entire action processing would look
  like a chain of calls Action -> Task -> Workflow where each level
  knows only about the next level and can influence it (e.g. if adhoc
  action has failed due to YAQL error in 'output' transformer action
  itself fails its task)
* Refactored policies according to new object model
* Fixed some of the tests to match the idea of having two types of
  exceptions, MistralException and MistralError, where the latter
  is considered either a harsh environmental problem or a logical
  issue in the system itself so that it must not be handled anywhere
  in the code

TODO(in subsequent patches):
 * Refactor WithItemsTask w/o using with_items.py
 * Remove DB transaction in Scheduler when making a delayed call,
   helper policy methods like 'continue_workflow'
 * Refactor policies test so that workflow definitions live right
   in test methods
 * Refactor workflow_handler with Workflow abstraction
 * Get rid of RunExistingTask workflow command, it should be just
   one command with various properties
 * Refactor resume and rerun with Task abstraction (same way as
   other methods, e.g. on_action_complete())
 * Add error handling to all required places such as
   task_handler.continue_task()
 * More tests for error handling

P.S. This patch is very big but it was nearly impossible to split
it into multiple smaller patches just because how entangled everything
was in Mistral Engine.

Before this change ModalBackdropMixin called super(...).__init__()
without arguments. This imposed restrictions on what classes this
mixin could have been mixed into, i.e. only classes, that do not accept
any parameters.
This proved to be a problem for murano-dashboard, since it uses this
mixin (indirectly through ModalFormMixin) and mixes it into a class,
that accepts parameters to it's init method.
This change allows to use ModalBackdropMixin with classes that have
init methods with parameters.

In general, import statements should be as specific as possible
and only import needed module. When from module import * is used,
you are implicitly loading all locals of the imported module into
and over the importing module. This has two disadvantages: first,
you might unintentionally overload already imported objects. Second,
it becomes difficult to detect undefined names in the program that
imported the module.

When an instance is rescued the libvirt driver creates a file in the.
instance directory that contains the original instance xml. This file
is used when unrescuing the instance to revert to the original disk
configuration. However, this file is not necessary to restore the
instance's original configuration. Furthermore the reliance on this
file means we currently cannot live migrate a rescued instance.  Thus
it is proposed that we do not create this file during the rescue
operation and rebuild the instance's original xml file from the
database when we unrescue it.

Due to oddities in the way that DNS used to work on older MAAS
versions, specifically when using LXC containers, the charm
would endeavour to discover a full forward/reverse resolvable
hostname/ip address to use when clustering with peers, and to
set the internal nodename for each RMQ instance.

Changes in MAAS 2.0 mean that an IP address may resolve to more
than 1 DNS record, making identification via DNS of the FQDN
problematic.

The charm actively manages /etc/hosts with IP address/hostname for
all peer units in a RMQ cluster using the cluster relation; make
use of this feature to allow the internal nodename of each unit
to actually be the hostname of the server, as the charm is ensuring
the resolvability of hostnames within the cluster.

To avoid races where the lead unit has not had its hostname written
to /etc/hosts, only cluster with the lead unit in the hook execution
where this actually happens.

Make the notifications stack properly

Rename 'persisted' property to
'timeoutable' to better match it's purpose, make 'timeoutable' part of
the notification Record, so the action which triggers the notification
can decide if notification uses timer or not in similar manner as
it is done with 'dismissable'

Make timeoutable notifications Timers pause on hover on Notification
Toaster instead of Notification itself to enable user to review the
notifications

Mark hidden Notifications as viewed instead of deleting them

This patch introduces a new API extension called 'trunk-details'.
This extension is used to expose trunk data for ports that are
used as a parent in a trunk. The main purpose of this extension
is to minimize the number of calls that an API consumer has to make
in order to fetch subport details when dealing with trunks. This
may happen for instance, if Nova's metadata/config-drive is
enhanced to expose this information for guest discovery.

Albeit this extension auguments the port resource, this is chosen
to be a trunk service plugin's extension to prevent issues like
bug #1496787 from occuring, and consequently tie ML2 to the trunk
plugin no further than it is absolutely necessary.

Partially-implements: blueprint vlan-aware-vms

This is a request to add the Vitrage project[1] to the Big Tent.
Vitrage aims to be the OpenStack RCA (Root Cause Analysis) Engine for
organizing, analyzing and expanding OpenStack alarms & events, yielding
insights regarding the root cause of problems and deducing their
existence before they are directly detected.

Vitrage provides an holistic and complete view of the cloud, with
a clear visualization of the physical-to-virtual (and soon the
applicative) layers. Vitrage receives information from various
OpenStack data sources (Aodh, Nova, Cinder and Neutron), as well as
from external data sources (like Nagios, and in the future Zabbix)
and combines it in a topology graph database. This topology is used to
deduce that certain problems in the physical layer should cause problems
in the virtual layer; to trigger corresponding alarms; to modify
(currently only in Vitrage) resources states; and to reflect the causal
relationship of the alarms in the cloud.

Vitrage development started right after Mitaka Summit, where we had
meetings with other OpenStack projects (like Ceilometer/Aodh), presented
to them Vitrage ideas, verified that there was no overlap between our
projects, and got their blessing.

Vitrage follows OpenStack guidelines and “four opens” from day one.
Vitrage code and specifications are entirely open source. The project
is fully licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, and the project uses
public code reviews in gerrit. The code can be found here[2][3][4][5].
Vitrage gate runs docs, pep8, python27, python34 and tempest tests.

The #openstack-vitrage IRC channel on freenode is logged [6]. Vitrage
team holds weekly IRC meetings on OpenStack official meeting channel,
which is logged as well[7]. Openstack-dev mailing list is used to
publicly discuss Vitrage related issues. Vitrage wiki page[1] consists
of high-level and low-level design documents, presentations and demos.
OpenStack launchpad[8] is used to manage blueprints and bugs. We started
the process of Newton design discussions right after Austin Summit. We
perform these discussions in the IRC meetings, in the mailing list, and
in etherpads[9][10] created for this purpose.

Vitrage was presented in two sessions in Austin Summit[11][12], as well
as in demos in the marketplace. In addition, Aodh-Vitrage integration
was discussed in Aodh design session[13][14]. One Aodh fix was already
made to enable this integration[15]. Other integrations, with Monasca
and Congress, were discussed during the summit, and we are continuing
such discussions in the mailing list.

In addition to OpenStack community, Vitrage is also involved in OPNFV
projects. Vitrage is considered a reference implementation for OPNFV
Doctor Inspector component [16][17], as well as for OPNFV PinPoint[18]
project. Vitrage is about to be presented, together with OPNFV Doctor
and with OpenStack Congress, in OPNFV Summit in Berlin[19]. Vitrage demo
is going to be presented in Doctor POC booth.

For the past six months, since Vitrage development began, we have been
encouraging interaction and cooperation with other projects and
contributors in OpenStack. To date, a few companies and projects have
worked with us on formulating requirements as well as contributed code.
We are working hard at involving additional players in Vitrage, to help
drive its feature set so that it supports a wide range of needs from the
community.

To summarize, Vitrage fills a real need in OpenStack. Vitrage holistic
and complete view that includes all of the layers of the cloud, as well
as its alarm analysis and correlation, is currently lacking in
OpenStack. As Vitrage enhances OpenStack capabilities, raises a lot of
interest in the community, and is developed by OpenStack standards, we
believe it belongs to the big tent.

Mission Alignment: Watcher's goal is to provide a flexible and scalable
resource optimization service for multi-tenant OpenStack-based clouds.
Watcher does this with a robust framework that can be configured to
achieve a wide range of cloud optimization goals, including the
reduction of data center operating costs, increased system performance
via intelligent virtual machine migration, increased energy efficiency
— and more!

Watcher builds an extensible platform for advanced optimization
services that can be used by operators to reduce the TCO of their
infrastructure. The Watcher project maintains a core team for both code
and specs that approves all changes. The Watcher API uses Keystone for
authentication and multi-tenancy. Oslo libraries are used by all
components where applicable. Watcher uses Telemetry as the default
backend for metrics collection and plans to integrate Monasca during
the Newton cycle. An integration with Congress is currently under
discussion [4]. Currently, the Watcher PTL is Antoine Cabot (acabot).
Regular elections are held to elect new PTLs and core members. Watcher
was initially discussed at the Vancouver Summit. The first Watcher
mid-cycle meetup was held in January 2016, which three companies
attended [6].

Watcher has an extensive set of documentation. Overall documentation
and links to documentation are at the Watcher Wiki [7]. The Watcher API
is documented [8]. Watcher provides a turn-key development environment
based on Devstack [9]. Watcher is continually deployed to test and
production environments off of master branch and maintains a very high
level of quality.

Many Manila drivers are capable to support VLAN networking but this
technology limits the number of used networks in the cloud to 4096.
HPB (hierarchical port binding) allows setups like VXLAN on top of
VLAN which fixes the 4k issue.

Unittests do not have 'CONF.datastore_manager' set (None).

As the result all datastore manager/app tests that access
configuration by the manager name get the default 'mysql' values.
Apart from not testing the production configuration this
also makes it difficult to test dynamically looked up
datastore-specific properties which do not exist in the mysql
group at all.

This patch set adds a helper method for patching any given
configuration property and also adds a simple interface for
patching the manager name to the base TestCase.

All existing manager/app tests were updated to properly patch the manager
property.
The base test patches the manager name to 'mysql' so that
all unittests run with this manager unless explicitly overriden.

It's now safe to remove the manager parameter from the
'cfg.get_configuration_property()' function. It was there
to work around this issue in unittests.

Similar to the https://review.openstack.org/#/c/259568 which added support
for the composable services StepConfig and ServiceConfigSettings parameters
so that the Controller role supports composable services, this adds those
interfaces for the ObjectStorage role.

Note that at this time the ObjectStorage post config only supports steps
2, 3 and 4, not all those in services/README.rst

In writing other tests, the INVENTORY_SKEL dictionary was mutated
globally and affecting tests. This change makes sure that it is copied
on each run, instead of re-used. During normal usage, this behavior is
not dramatically different, because the INVENTORY_SKEL dictionary is
destroyed when the script exits. However, when running tests, the module
and thus the variable stay loaded and are not implicitly destroyed.

This changed revealed that USED_IPS was also not being properly cleaned
on the duplicate IP test. In order to minimize the scope of this commit, the
affected test is fixed rather than all instances of USED_IPS access.

The _net_address_search function looks through the provider networks and
sets a key to True if it's the main network. This commit adds tests
around the conditionals found in the function. In practice, the keys
that are used (is_ssh_address and is_container_address) are specified in
the gate user_config files, but this function seems to be there to catch
and correct errors.

The 'else' clause from the 'for' loop was moved up, since logically it
was the action that happened when the target key was not present. The
'else' clause made it re-loop, which was unnecessary.
