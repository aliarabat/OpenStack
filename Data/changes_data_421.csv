Report back and update the actual volume size that is created in ScaleIO.

ScaleIO volumes support sizes that are multiplies of 8 GB.
This change updates the db with the real volume size.
However, it is a partial fix, because the quota is not updated.

The boolean property sio_round_volume_capacity specifies whether the
user allows ScaleIO to create volumes with a size that is
not a multiply of 8GB, hence causing ScaleIO to round it up.
When set to False, creation of volumes with a size that is different
than 8GB will fail.

The repo container's package cache causes quite a bit of confusion
given that it's a 'hidden' feature which catches deployers off-guard
when they already have their own cache configured. This is really
the kind of service which people should manage outside of OSA. It
also makes no sense if the deployer is using their own local mirror
which is a fairly common practise. Adding to that, it seems that it
is broken in bionic, causing massive delays in package installs.
Finally, it also adds to quite a bit of complexity due to the fact
that it's in a container - so in the playbooks prior to the container's
existence we have to detect whether it's there and add/remove the config
accordingly.

Let's just remove it and let deployers managing their own caching
infrastructure if they want it.

set the basepython value in each environment.

Barbican API uses uWSGI, which by default writes out log files using
0640 permissions and default ownership for the user. This means that the
log file in /var/log/kolla/barbican/barbican-api.log is not readable by
fluentd.

This was tested via the following command on a queens deployment:

$ docker exec -it fluentd bash
find /var/log/kolla/ -type f | while read f; do test -r $f || echo
""Cannot read $f""; done
Cannot read /var/log/kolla/barbican/barbican-api.log

Generally there are a few ways in which access is provided to log file
for fluentd:

1. Set log file ownership to $USER:kolla, permissions to 0640.
2. Set log file ownership to $USER:$USER, permissions to 0644.
3. MariaDB is a special case, and uses 0640 with the fluentd user added
to the mysql group.

Of these, 1. seems the most secure.

This change uses the --logfile-chmod argument to set the log file
permissions to 644, since it does not appear possible to specify a group
to change ownership to using --logfile-chown. We use command line
arguments since putting the option in the config file does not seem to
work. Perhaps it is an ordering issue.

Although using 'os_auth_ver' parameter is deprecated, freezer-api (or
freezer-web-ui respectively) still uses it to generate configs for jobs.
Commit 50df2c8 introduced regression causing freezer-agent refusing to
start when config passed via '--config' contains 'os_auth_ver' parameter
(or any other deprecated option). The root cause is that loop (L568)
iterates through keys defined in config file passed via '--config'
therefore trying to call CONF.set_override with deprecated 'os_auth_ver'
as a first argument which causes oslo.config library to raise
KeyError: 'os-identity-api-version' as CONF.set_override is not expected
to be called with deprecated options. This simple patch adds call for
get for each key which may (correctly) raise NoSuchOptError for undefined
(and deprecated) keys, thus safely fallbacking to except routine.

Re-submitted.

To enable split logging functionality [1] we need to register
'split_logger' conf option under [keystone_authtoken] section.

There are two options to add this new 'split_logger' config option
under keystone_authtoken.

1. In Keystonemiddleware, as it is done for other config options
'certfile', 'keyfile', 'cafile', 'insecure' config option.
2. All above config options mentioned in point #1 are also available
to be registered using register_session_conf_options from keystoneauth
library including few others i.e. 'split_loggers', 'timeout' and
'collect-timing'.

This patch follows option 1 explained above to register 'split_loggers'
conf option. Implementing second option causing duplicate registration of
'timeout' conf option(DuplicateOptError) because it is registered at [2].

When we create or retype a volume using the volume type which

raise a 404 error.

There are a uuid check in ""get_by_name_or_id()"", and the
uuid-like type name would be mistakenly recognized as a id,

This patch renames the set_and_clear_allocations function in the
scheduler report client to move_allocations and adds handling of
consumer generation conflict for it. This call now moves everything from
one consumer to another and raises AllocationMoveFailed to the caller if
the move fails due to consumer generation conflict.

When migration or resize fails to move the source host allocation to the
migration_uuid then the API returns HTTP 409 and the migration is aborted.

If reverting a migration, a resize, or a resize to same host fails to move
the source host allocation back to the instance_uuid due consumer generation
conflict the instance will be put into ERROR state. The instance still has two
allocations in this state and deleting the instance only deletes the one that
is held by the instance_uuid. This patch logs an ERROR describing that in this
case the allocation held by the migration_uuid is leaked.

On centos7.2, it doesn't happen every time, but sometimes, partprobe
fails with error `Device or resource busy` in _fix_gpt_structs. In fact,
this is not a problem, I tried ignoring this error and ran remain code.
Things went well. The target of running `partprobe` is to check GPT
table, we can run `sgdisk -v` instead.

This patch is to replace `partprobe` command in _fix_gpt_structs to
avoid `Device or resource busy` error.

This patch adds a new role called OpenShiftInfra which is required to
define infra nodes. We've been bundling infra nodes with compute and
master nodes and they ought to be independent.

With the new node label management introduced in openshift-ansible, it
sounds like this is a good time for us to unbundle these nodes.

The current hash ring code suffers from several problems:

1. The cache is reset on any get_topic_for call, which means that the
   cache is not used between API calls. Previously it was done to work
   around the situation when a new conductor is not visible until the API
   process restarts. Currently we refresh the hash rings periodically.

   This patch removes resetting the cache. To avoid waiting 2 minutes to
   be able to use a new driver:
   1) the hash ring cache is always rebuilt when a ring is not found,
   2) the hash_ring_reset_interval option was changed to 15 seconds.

2. The reset of the cache races with the hot path in the get_ring call.
   It is possible that the reset happens after the class-level cache
   variable is checked but before it is used, yielding None.

   This patch stores the value of the class-level variable to a local
   variable before checking, thus ensuring None is never returned.

Finally, some logging was added to the modified code to make this kind
of problems more debugable in the future.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

In order to get volume metrics sended to ceilometer,
cinder-volume-usage-audit must be manually runned (or with cron/systemd timer).
Similar to nova approach (volume_usage_audit_period in cinder.conf)
is not working.

So this change add cinder_volume_usage_audit variable,
according to which cron job will be placed
on cinder-volumes servers.

Job uses another type of quotes, due to escaping problems

Each compute node must be managing a cluster in the same vCenter and ESX
hosts must have vMotion enabled [1].
If the instance is located on a datastore shared between source

select the most suitable datastore on the destination cluster and

The current hash ring code suffers from several problems:

1. The cache is reset on any get_topic_for call, which means that the
   cache is not used between API calls. Previously it was done to work
   around the situation when a new conductor is not visible until the API
   process restarts. Currently we refresh the hash rings periodically.

   This patch removes resetting the cache. To avoid waiting 2 minutes to
   be able to use a new driver:
   1) the hash ring cache is always rebuilt when a ring is not found,
   2) the hash_ring_reset_interval option was changed to 15 seconds.

2. The reset of the cache races with the hot path in the get_ring call.
   It is possible that the reset happens after the class-level cache
   variable is checked but before it is used, yielding None.

   This patch stores the value of the class-level variable to a local
   variable before checking, thus ensuring None is never returned.

Finally, some logging was added to the modified code to make this kind
of problems more debugable in the future.

Users expect this to be parsed as rST and write their docstrings accordingly.
This has the potential to introduce warnings for users with improperly
formatted rST and these warnings can be promoted to errors if 'sphinx-build' is
used with the '-W' option. As a result, we disable the 'warning-is-error'
logger for these options. We may wish to change this behavior in the future.

It is not really possible to test this yet as the output wouldn't look much
different. In addition, the error messages generated are rather unhelpful. Both
of these can be changed in a future modification.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

Several operations (e.g. stack check) are yet to be converted to
convergence-style workflows, and still create locks. While we try to always
remove dead locks, it's possible that if one of these gets left behind we
won't notice, since convergence doesn't actually use stack locks for most
regular operations.

When doing _check_status_complete() on a nested stack resource, we wait for
the operation to release the nested stack's lock before reporting the
resource completed, to ensure that for legacy operations the nested stack
is ready to perform another action on as soon as the resource is complete.
For convergence stacks this is an unnecessary DB call, and it can lead to
resources never completing if a stray lock happens to be left in the
database.

Only check the nested stack's stack lock for operations where we are not
taking a resource lock. This corresponds exactly to legacy-style
operations.

This is modified from master to inline the _should_lock_on_action()
method, which does not exist on this branch.

The IPA ramdisk and kernel images may be built or downloaded via a URL.
If the latter option is used, any images previously downloaded to
$KOLLA_CONFIG_PATH/config/ironic/ironic-agent.* would previously not be
updated if the image contents change.

This change introduces variables for setting a URL to a file containing
checksums for the images. The algorithm used to compute the checksum is
also configurable (default sha256). This allows us to ensure we are
using the correct version of the image, while avoiding an expensive few
hundred megabyte image download just to check.

If a checksum is not specified, the image will be downloaded every time
to ensure that it is up to date.

Some open questions:
  - A bunch of internal imports (more than I hoped)
  - We need mistral as a test requirement - it isn't in global requirements
  - sqlite only so far (possibly a good thing)
  - We need to manually register every action we use - unless it is a tripleo
    action, then it is added automatically thanks to setup.cfg, but we need to
    mock it. Re-registering a new action may be easier than mocking, if that
    works
  - Tests are heavily tied to Mistral internals and database. We should
    probably write a bunch of helper methods to abstract anything we access
    should it change later. I'd hope only one file would ever import from
    Mistral directly.
  - We *might* need to run these in their own dedicated test suite. There
    seems to be an issue where it is causing other tripleo-common tests to
    hang. Due to eventlet monkey patching maybe?

pbr bases its version numbers on git tags and automatically increments
these version numbers when you make commits to a branch. For example,
the version of a branch whose last tag is '17.0.0' will be '17.0.0',
while the version of that same branch with two additional commits will
be '17.0.1.dev2'. This is useful from a development context but is
rather unusual from a documentation perspective, particularly on stable
branches, as this is not seen as the documentation for a future version
but rather the modified documentation for a past version.

Modify the behavior of the feature to transform the 'N+1.devM' suffix to
'N-post', so '17.0.1.dev2' would become '17.0.0-post'.

When a heat-engine thread activity completes, it calls release on
its stack_lock object in the database. If that release action fails
due to an inability to update the database, that engine process is no
longer usable. This code catches that failure, logs it, and terminates
that engine process so that a new one can be started. New heat engines
will automatically purge stale stack_locks from the database.
Also, make sure that if the thread exit does not teardown the process
after 5 seconds, the non blockable os level exit call will be invoked.

This bug is very timing specific. The DB error needs to exist when the
stack_lock release fails

Currently there is a race where ceph-nfs is free to be started before
the colocation constraint with the VIP is created. This issue is
exacerbated by the fact that the container being started (via a systemd
unit file managed by pacemaker) never fails in case the daemon
encounters an error, because it has inside it:
/usr/bin/ganesha.nfsd ""${GANESHA_OPTIONS[@]}"" -L /var/log/ganesha/ganesha.log ""${GANESHA_EPOCH}"" || return 0

Since the container never fails, docker never exits and so systemd and
pacemaker think everything is fine and it won't get rescheduled on
another node.

We can avoid this issue completely if we can guarantee that
we start the VIP and the ceph-nfs service on the bootstrap node only
(by tagging only that node with the right property) and only later we
add the node property on all the other nodes.

The drawback of this approach is that, barring any failures, ceph-nfs
will always be started on the master node for that service.

Barbican API uses uWSGI, which by default writes out log files using
0640 permissions and default ownership for the user. This means that the
log file in /var/log/kolla/barbican/barbican-api.log is not readable by
fluentd.

This was tested via the following command on a queens deployment:

$ docker exec -it fluentd bash
find /var/log/kolla/ -type f | while read f; do test -r $f || echo
""Cannot read $f""; done
Cannot read /var/log/kolla/barbican/barbican-api.log

Generally there are a few ways in which access is provided to log file
for fluentd:

1. Set log file ownership to $USER:kolla, permissions to 0640.
2. Set log file ownership to $USER:$USER, permissions to 0644.
3. MariaDB is a special case, and uses 0640 with the fluentd user added
to the mysql group.

Of these, 1. seems the most secure.

This change uses the --logfile-chmod argument to set the log file
permissions to 644, since it does not appear possible to specify a group
to change ownership to using --logfile-chown. We use command line
arguments since putting the option in the config file does not seem to
work. Perhaps it is an ordering issue.

message queue. Only when all these relations are complete can the
registration happen. Below are major changes included in this PR.

* Add nova-cell-api relation for communicating with the
  nova-cell-conductor
* Add shared-db-cell relation for communicating with the
  a compute cells database.
* Add amqp-cell relation for communicating with the
  a compute cells message queue.
* Add methods for registering cells with the
  superconductors database.
* Charm helper sync

The fluentd v1.2 officially contains the elasticsearch plugin which is used
in fluent-logging. So, I suggest to use the latest offical image from the
fluentd.io

The current neutron implementation has several high availability and
rescheduling features to enhance its reliability, availability and
serviceability. However, it does not implement a mechanism to directly
report stateful fault information via a fault management interface,
which limits reporting and automated recovery capabilities.

This spec proposes to add a fault management driver to be implemented in
neutron that will perform the OS-level fault management implementation
to generate alarms, report issues when something goes wrong, and also to
get, clear the fault states for ports, agents, hosts, provider networks
etc. This enables another external entity to monitor the faults of
different severity levels occurred in neutron and make fault
handling/scheduling decisions for the related services.

Currently, neutron does not provide an independent system host
management ability. Instead, the host segments functionality is based on
the state reported by the agent according to the deployment level
configurations, a table is updated to track which hosts have access to
which provider networks. This is being used to make DHCP scheduling
decisions but bugs have been identified in how they handle multiple
mechanism drivers (see [1] and [2]). In addition, there are also
performance costs with accessing the information for complex
queries which may impact larger deployments during scheduling
operations, and therefore require further improvements.

This spec proposes an host extension which adds host management to the
neutron API. It is expected that another entity (e.g., NFV-VIM or Bare
Metal and Node Management) is sending host update notifications to let
neutron know when hosts are added, deleted or when they change state. It
also allows for that external entity to tell neutron which provider
networks are associated to which host. This enables neutron to make
scheduling decisions about where DHCP and router services can be
scheduled. This also enables neutron to generate, report host-level
issues when something goes wrong. Otherwise, the system will operate
based on agent availability only, if the extension is not loaded and
host state is not being managed.

In order to allow the ironic inspector dnsmasq service to
receive packets after the network service is restarted, the
bind-interfaces option should not be set.  Since the
ironic inspector is bound to the br-ctlplane interface,
its not necessary to set this field as this dnsmasq instance
will only service this interface.

From the dnsmasq man page (http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html).
-z, --bind-interfaces
On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address,
even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then
discards requests that it shouldn't reply to. This has the
advantage of working even when interfaces come and go and
change address. This option forces dnsmasq to really bind only
the interfaces it is listening on. About the only time when
this is useful is when running another nameserver (or another
instance of dnsmasq) on the same machine. Setting this option
also enables multiple instances of dnsmasq which provide DHCP
service to run in the same machine.

We do run another dnsmasq instance for neutron but that is bound to
the tap interface in the namespace.

Developers run all sorts of different tools within Git repositories,
any of which can leave their own special trashfiles all over the
place. We can't every hope to catalog them all, so better to
recommend developers simply configure a global core.excludesfile to
filter the irrelevant files which tend to get created by their
personal choice of tools. Add a comment block explaining this, for
clarity, and remove the one current editor-specific entry present.

We can, and should of course, continue to list files created by the
tools recommended by our workflow (test frameworks, documentation
and packaging builds, et cetera).

Since we moved to containerized UC, TLS Everywhere deployments are broken.
Namely we miss two things:

A. The NAT iptables rule for the nova metadata service to be reachable
B. The setting 'service_metadata_proxy=false' needs to be set for nova
   metadata otherwise the curl calls to setup ipa will fail with the
   following:
[root@overcloud-controller-0 log]# curl http://169.254.169.254/openstack/2016-10-06
<html>
 <head>
  <title>400 Bad Request</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <h1>400 Bad Request</h1>
  X-Instance-ID header is missing from request.<br /><br />
 </body>
</html>

A. Is fixed by adding a conditional iptables rule that is only triggered
   when deploying an undercloud (where we set MetadataNATRule to true)

B. Is fixed by setting NeutronMetadataProxySharedSecret to '' on the
   undercloud and then setting the corresponding hiera keys only when
   the parameter != ''. We tried alternative simpler approaches like
   setting NeutronMetadataProxySharedSecret to null but that will break
   heat as the parameter is required and setting it to null breaks heat
   validation (we also tried to make the parameter optional with a
   default: '', but that broke as well)

While we're at it we also remove the neutron metadata service from the
undercloud as it is not needed.

Tested by deploying an undercloud with this change and observing:
A.
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 106 packets, 6698 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    0     0 REDIRECT   tcp  --  br-ctlplane *       0.0.0.0/0            169.254.169.254      multiport dports 80 state NEW /* 999 undercloud nat ipv4 */ redir ports 8775

B.
grep -ir ^service_metadata_proxy /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/nova/etc/nova/nova.conf
service_metadata_proxy=False

Also a deployment of a TLS overcloud was successful.

Starting a VM with an NVMe volume after compute node reboots fails
because nova try to disconnect the volume then connect it again.

The proposed fix is to skip volume disconnect if the device not
connected.

The VIFGeneric os-vif type is used for the kernel TAP based plugging. If
the os-vif plugin has not created a TAP device, the hypervisor will
create one (multiqueue enabled, if set). If the os-vif plugin has to
create a multiqueue TAP device, it needs a hint if multiqueue is
desired.

In Nova, the check whether to enable multiqueue on virtio interfaces is
done at the instance level by the hypervisor. The intention is to pass
the results of that check to the os-vif plugin via the port profile.

This patch adds VIFPortProfileGenericMultiqueue with a
'virtio_multiqueue' field.

Currently there is a race where ceph-nfs is free to be started before
the colocation constraint with the VIP is created. This issue is
exacerbated by the fact that the container being started (via a systemd
unit file managed by pacemaker) never fails in case the daemon
encounters an error, because it has inside it:
/usr/bin/ganesha.nfsd ""${GANESHA_OPTIONS[@]}"" -L /var/log/ganesha/ganesha.log ""${GANESHA_EPOCH}"" || return 0

Since the container never fails, docker never exits and so systemd and
pacemaker think everything is fine and it won't get rescheduled on
another node.

We can avoid this issue completely if we can guarantee that
we start the VIP and the ceph-nfs service on the bootstrap node only
(by tagging only that node with the right property) and only later we
add the node property on all the other nodes.

The drawback of this approach is that, barring any failures, ceph-nfs
will always be started on the master node for that service.

Since we moved to containerized UC, TLS Everywhere deployments are broken.
Namely we miss two things:

A. The NAT iptables rule for the nova metadata service to be reachable
B. The setting 'service_metadata_proxy=false' needs to be set for nova
   metadata otherwise the curl calls to setup ipa will fail with the
   following:
[root@overcloud-controller-0 log]# curl http://169.254.169.254/openstack/2016-10-06
<html>
 <head>
  <title>400 Bad Request</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <h1>400 Bad Request</h1>
  X-Instance-ID header is missing from request.<br /><br />
 </body>
</html>

A. Is fixed by adding a conditional iptables rule that is only triggered
   when deploying an undercloud (where we set MetadataNATRule to true)

B. Is fixed by setting NeutronMetadataProxySharedSecret to '' on the
   undercloud and then setting the corresponding hiera keys only when
   the parameter != ''. We tried alternative simpler approaches like
   setting NeutronMetadataProxySharedSecret to null but that will break
   heat as the parameter is required and setting it to null breaks heat
   validation (we also tried to make the parameter optional with a
   default: '', but that broke as well)

While we're at it we also remove the neutron metadata service from the
undercloud as it is not needed.

Tested by deploying an undercloud with this change and observing:
A.
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 106 packets, 6698 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    0     0 REDIRECT   tcp  --  br-ctlplane *       0.0.0.0/0            169.254.169.254      multiport dports 80 state NEW /* 999 undercloud nat ipv4 */ redir ports 8775

B.
grep -ir ^service_metadata_proxy /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/nova/etc/nova/nova.conf
service_metadata_proxy=False

Also a deployment of a TLS overcloud was successful.

The way heat-native was implemented, we couldn't disable it.
And when disabled, it was not working.

- operators can now pass: --heat-native=False or configure
  heat_native=False in undercloud.conf, then heat native will actually be
  disabled.
- 'latest' tag doesn't exist for centos-binary-heat-all so we default
  to current-tripleo with is a safe default for us.
- when the heat_all container is done, it returns 137 (kill -9) which is
  good but we don't want to fail on that.

Adds check mode support for puppet host tasks.

This works by writing the new puppet host manifest under
/var/lib/tripleo-config/check-mode, and diffing it against the existing
version of the manifest.

Puppet is also run with --noop, so that it only reports on what changes
would have been made.

It also uses the check mode hiera configuration at
/etc/puppet/check-mode/hiera.yaml if it exists so that the updated hiera
data is also accounted for when puppet runs with --noop.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

This introduces additional mariadb tuning options, namely:

- innodb_log_file_size:

  Configure the size in bytes of each log file in a log group.
  Generally, the combined size of the log files should be large enough
  that the server can smooth out peaks and troughs in workload activity,
  which often means that there is enough redo log space to handle more
  than an hour of write activity.
  The larger the value, the less checkpoint flush activity is required
  in the buffer pool, saving disk I/O.

- innodb_flush_method

  Defines the method used to flush data to InnoDB data files and log files,
  which can affect I/O throughput. If innodb_flush_method is set to NULL
  on a Unix-like system, the fsync option is used by default.

  The innodb_flush_method options for Unix-like systems include:

  - fsync: InnoDB uses the fsync() system call to flush the data and log files.
  - O_DSYNC: InnoDB uses O_SYNC to open and flush the log files,
    and fsync() to flush the data files.
  - littlesync: currently unsupported. Use at your own risk.
  - nosync: currently unsupported. Use at your own risk.
  - O_DIRECT: InnoDB uses O_DIRECT to open the data files,
    and uses fsync() to flush both the data and log files.

- table_open_cache

  The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this value
  increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires.
  You can check whether you need to increase the table cache by checking the
  Opened_tables status variable. If the value of Opened_tables is large
  and you do not use FLUSH TABLES often, then you should increase the value of
  the table_open_cache variable.

default value for all three is 'undef'.

Currently in all Python Monasca components the copy of `kafka-python`
library in version 0.9.5 (released on Feb 16, 2016) is used. This
specification describes the process of upgrading the Apache Kafka client
to `confluent-kafka-python`. This will improve the performance and
reliability. Sticking with the old frozen client version is also
unacceptable in terms of security.

The current hash ring code suffers from several problems:

1. The cache is reset on any get_topic_for call, which means that the
   cache is not used between API calls. Previously it was done to work
   around the situation when a new conductor is not visible until the API
   process restarts. Currently we refresh the hash rings periodically.

   This patch removes resetting the cache. To avoid waiting 2 minutes to
   be able to use a new driver:
   1) the hash ring cache is always rebuilt when a ring is not found,
   2) the hash_ring_reset_interval option was changed to 15 seconds.

2. The reset of the cache races with the hot path in the get_ring call.
   It is possible that the reset happens after the class-level cache
   variable is checked but before it is used, yielding None.

   This patch stores the value of the class-level variable to a local
   variable before checking, thus ensuring None is never returned.

Finally, some logging was added to the modified code to make this kind
of problems more debugable in the future.
