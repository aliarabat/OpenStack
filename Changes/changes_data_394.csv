As of Ocata, cinder config is preferred for rbd auth values with a
fallback to nova values [1]. The fallback path, for the case when
rbd_user is configured in cinder.conf and rbd_secret_uuid is not
configured in cinder.conf, results in the mismatched use of cinder
rbd_user with nova rbd_secret_uuid.

This fixes that fallback path to use nova rbd_user from nova.conf
with rbd_secret_uuid from nova.conf.

PEP 3333[1] says request and response headers (within the application)
should be treated as native `str` (whatever the Python version). It's
the job of the WSGI server to translate from `str` to reasonable output
on the outgoing socket connection.

This was already mostly correct but two issues were discovered while
trying to create integration tests that use the value of the location
response header when POSTing to create a server. In python2 it was
working. In Python3 the header had a value of

location: http://192.168.1.76/compute/v2.1/b'http:/192.168.1.76/compute/v2.1/servers/fad04042-850b-443a-9e48-773111cbc981'

(note the b'...' bounding the full url on the end).

This was happening for two reasons:

* nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py independently encodes the
  location header to utf-8, instead of using the centralized handling
  in nova/api/openstack/wsgi.py

  This meant that the value of the location header would arrive, in
  Python 3, at the centralized handling as a bytestring.

* The centralized handling in nova/api/openstack/wsgi.py was incorrectly
  using the six.text_type() method. That is simply an alias to unicode
  in python 2 and str in python3. In python3 when given a bytestring
  as the only argument object.__str()__ is called on the argument.
  Which yields b'whatever'.

At that stage, the handling in the web server which processes a location
header to check for the presence of a host and prefix already at the
start of the provided location will find b'...' and do a concatenation
without any replace.

So, because of all that, this patch includes three changes:

* The server creation location header code does no encoding and relies
  on the centralized handling.

* The centralized handling removes the use of text_type() as a function
  because that is redundant with the safe_encode and safe_decode changes
  in the same loop.

* Doc strings and comments in the ResponseObject are clarified with
  regard to this encoding topic.

Also, comments in Resource._process_stack are updated to correspond with
the changes above. The code is not changed, as they are already doing
the right thing: The comment was misrepresenting what was going on.
There is some duplication of code between these two areas, but the code
is too inscrutable for me to be willing to change a part that isn't
presenting an explicit bug.

Tests for the internal production of the location header are adjusted
to reflect these changes.

With placement being extracted from nova, the
""Resource Providers"" nova-status upgrade check no
longer works as intended since the placement data
will no longer be in the nova_api database. As a
result the check can fail on otherwise properly
deployed setups with placement extracted.

This check was originally intended to ease the upgrade
to Ocata when placement was required for nova to work,
as can be seen from the newton/ocata/pike references
in the code.

Note that one could argue the check itself as a concept
is still useful for fresh installs to make sure everything
is deployed correctly and nova-compute is properly
reporting into placement, but for it to be maintained
we would have to change it to no longer rely on the
nova_api database and instead use the placement REST API,
which while possible, might not be worth the effort or
maintenance cost.

For simplicity and expediency, the check is simply removed
in this change.

With change I861b223ee46b0f0a31f646a4b45f8a02410253cf
the caller of the various scatter_gatter functions can
get any exception result and decide what kind of logging
is necessary, so this change removes the logging from
the scatter_gather_cells method **for NovaExceptions**.
This is needed because of change
Iaea1cb4ed93bb98f451de4f993106d7891ca3682 where
showing a server which is deleted, which results in an
InstanceNotFound exception, gets logged as an exception
in the nova-api logs and shouldn't be.

Non-NovaExceptions will still get logged as before since
those are likely due to unexpected errors, like DBErrors.

Exception messages are expected to be strings, but it's not always
the case. Some exceptions are wrapped and passed as new exception
messages, which affects some exception handlers.

Finding all the occurrences may be difficult. For now, it's easier
to just convert the exception messages to strings in the NovaException
class.

Under POD restart conditions there is a race condition with lsblk
causing the helm chart to zap a fully working OSD disk. We refactor
the code to remove this requirement.

Additonally the new automatic journal partitioning code has a race
condition in which the same journal partition could be picked twice
for OSDs on the same node. To resolve this we share a common tmp
directory from the node to all of the OSD pods on that node.

If glance does not have any resource type association，we will get
IndexError when getting resource_name from list_resource_types's
response body because the response body does not have any resource_types.

This patch fixes this bug with the following method:
Adding judgment whether the list_resource_types's response body contains
resource_types before getting resource_name.If there is no resource_types,
we shoule set one initialized resource_name to get the test going on.

Currently os-net-config exits immediately if an interface fails to
come up.  This causes problems when we call it with a failsafe
configuration because it can result in working interfaces not
being configured if there are also non-functional interfaces, which
can leave a system unreachable over the network even though it may
have a working connection.

This change stores errors and handles them after all interfaces have
been processed to allow os-net-config to do what it can even with an
invalid configuration.  If any failures are detected it will still
cause os-net-config to report failure at the end.

In some case, the aggregate's operation sequence on DB may

For example:
Operations on DB:
1. add host
2. delete host

However, on scheduler, if the operation's sequence reversed as:
1. delete host
2. add host
It will case the DB/scheduler outer-sync.

To resolve this, if the timestamp of update_aggregates is old than
existing aggregate, pass this update.

When a subnet's enable_dhcp attribute is updated, we must restart
dhcp device. So,when we decide whether 'restart' or
'reload_allocations' in refresh_dhcp_helper function we only compare
the cidr of subnets which enabled dhcp.

The previous logic only calls 'restart' when deleting or adding a
subnet. This may cause the dhcp port not updated when the subnet's
enable_dhcp is updated to True.

enforcer for policy can be loaded from a single file or from multiple
files (policy_dir). so checking for policy_file is not good enough.

If a policy is loaded it will have some rules, if not loaded then,
oslo_policy rejects all acccess, but it is not saved to the
_ENFORCER object, which is holds the objects used for enforcing
policies. So checking for existance of rules is a better check.

Some refactoring for better logging
added tests: test_nonexisting_policy_file_load

If the user passes in the `galera_ignore_cluster_state=true` flag, like
in the case of a node addition or a rolling replacement of nodes,
this role will fail to execute on all new nodes due to the existance of
a functioning cluster galera cluster. The first task in the pre-upgrade
steps attempts to stop the mysql service prior to running anything else.

In this patch we change the task flow to evaluate whether a service
exists, and if it does then to stop it - otherwise skip that task. This
ensures that if `galera_ignore_cluster_state=true` is passed through, the
playbook will run successfully.

as it is a leftover from the pre-Python 3 legacy days when
DBAPIs under Python 2 would crash if you passed them a

  method instead of delete or post directly.  This way exceptions will
  be propagated.
- Modified clustering client wait_for_status to accept list of expected
  statuses.
- Use tenacity to retry delete cluster and detach policy calls if it
  returns Conflict because of locked cluster.
- Wait for action status to become SUCCEEDED or FAILED when calling
  delete cluster or detach policy.
- Use custom detach policy as cleanup action so that it waits for 5
  seconds to allow the health manager to stop health check threads
- Use separate prepare_and_cleanup_nova_server function call for
  nova_server_cluster test and health_policy tests to avoid race
  condition between the tests.
- Make list of dictionary keys before indexing (need for python 3)

Currently os-net-config exits immediately if an interface fails to
come up.  This causes problems when we call it with a failsafe
configuration because it can result in working interfaces not
being configured if there are also non-functional interfaces, which
can leave a system unreachable over the network even though it may
have a working connection.

This change stores errors and handles them after all interfaces have
been processed to allow os-net-config to do what it can even with an
invalid configuration.  If any failures are detected it will still
cause os-net-config to report failure at the end.

Jonathan Rosser <jonathan.rosser@rd.bbc.co.uk>:

This patch introduces a map which allows tempest images to be specified
per CPU architecture. Appropriate images will be uploaded for x86_64 and
aarch64, alternatively tempest_images can be overridden by the deployer.

This change is primarily designed to enable tempest testing via AIO/CI
on architectures other than x86_64.

For aarch64 we must use a cirros 0.4.0 image, as there is no earlier
version available for this architecture.

==

Paul Martin <paul.martin@codethink.co.uk>:

Replace cirros image with one with updated kernel and grub-uefi.

The upstream Cirros 0.4.0 image contains a combination of kernel and
grub-uefi that doesn't parse the QEMU/KVM device tree information
correctly, leading to an image that fails to have a serial console or an
interrupt controller, so crashes silently at kernel initialization.

The 'kayobe overcloud inventory discover' command can be used to discover an
overcloud inventory from the nodes in the ironic service running on the seed.
This works well for cases where the nodes have been autodiscovered, and as such
do not exist in the kayobe inventory.

There is another use case where overcloud nodes already exist in the kayobe
inventory. In that case we don't want to run the above command, as it will
create duplicate hosts in the inventory. We do however want the part of that
command that generates bifrost host variables for the overcloud nodes.

This change moves the generation of bifrost host variables to the 'kayobe
overcloud provision' and 'kayobe overcloud hardware inspect' commands,
which are used in each of these cases.

Kayobe writes out several host variables to the Kolla ansible inventory
files, etc/kolla/inventory/seed and etc/kolla/inventory/overcloud. These
include ansible_host, and network interfaces such as api_interface,
ironic_dnsmasq_interface, etc.

In Ansible, these should have a higher precedence than the kolla ansible
group variables in ansible/group_vars/all.yml that set the defaults.
However, in Ansible 2.4+, if the host has the same name as a group that
it is in, the group variables now take precedence, meaning that it is
not possible to override them.

This was observed when using the kayobe-config-dev repo for testing,
where the seed host is in the seed group.

Admittedly ansible does tell you not to do this: [WARNING]:
Found both group and host with same name: localhost

The solution used here is to use a separate host_vars file for each
host. Alternatively we could enforce that hostnames and groups do not
overlap.

The endpoints 'network_driver_program_external_connectivity'
and 'network_driver_revoke_external_connectivity' will dynamically
create security group and security group rules to open the ports
exposed by the docker container. However, such processing invokes
too much neutron API calls thus significantly slowing down the
container start/stop. However, such processing is not mandatory
because users can manually configure the SGs to achieve the
equivalent.

This patch make the processing of exposed ports configurable.
As a result, it can be disabled if users want a better performance.

This list is used for optimizing listener creation

be more robust to delete this list from Kuryr and handle
the corresponding exception in case specific protocol

Building from openstack-base brings a lot of unneeded overhead into the
end container. We only need a minimal setup, so let's rely on
dependencies of the python-tripleo package instead of explicitly
pulling in world from openstack-base. That saves space, and reduces
potential attacks vectors and CVEs to maintain for the tripleoclient
container.

This reverts commit dffcf4b54a29e64a026bcda9795b57953388019c.

Prior to this patch, output to stdout would look as follows:

INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl MySQLImpl.

  Need to apply migrations from neutron contract branch. This will require all Neutron server instances to be shutdown before
  proceeding with the upgrade.

However, with this patch, now only the following shows up:

INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl MySQLImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl MySQLImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.

The message to notify the deployer to run migrations does not appear to be
present in any log files either.

The message and return code are used by deployment projects to determine
whether migrations must be run, for example:

When serving a request to the metadata API, we get the
instance record out of the cell database along with
joining on several other tables, and not all of those
are needed based on configuration:

* We don't need to join on security_groups if we're
  using neutron (meta-api will get neutron security
  group information for the instance from neutron
  directly since nova doesn't cache that info in the
  DB).

* We don't need to join on system_metadata unless a
  dynamic vendordata provider is being used (the
  request to dynamic vendordata providers includes
  the ""boot_roles"" information which is stashed in
  system_metadata).

Also, the password handler can also be optimized to
join on system_metadata explicitly and avoid a lazy-load
of that information (Instance.get_by_uuid by default
joins on info_cache and security_groups).

In the long ago (kilo), system_metadata would have been
used if the instance.flavor internal data storage needed to
be migrated to the instance_extra table, but that data
migration needed to be completed by the time people upgraded
to Liberty:

  Ide5492b8b52dec665088d7bca78c386418eba0fe

So that data migration is no longer a concern here.

In devstack/pkg, there is an elasticsearch.sh for downloading,
installing, starting and uninstalling of elasticsearch server,
but it is not flexible. In the future, freezer-api needs to support
ubuntu-xenial and ubuntu-bonic, which requires different elasticsearch
server versions. In addition, the programming interface of elastic
search server varies greatly before and after 5.0.0, which requires
different code of freezer-api to support. Pre-5.0.0 version
of elasticsearch server cannot be installed on ubuntu-bonic.
For the convenience of modification, freezer-api maintains
the elastic search.sh script by itself.

- Use keystone session to create openstacksdk connection.
- Removed test case for getting senlin client because we are now passing

The endpoints 'network_driver_program_external_connectivity'
and 'network_driver_revoke_external_connectivity' will dynamically
create security group and security group rules to open the ports
exposed by the docker container. However, such processing invokes
too much neutron API calls thus significantly slowing down the
container start/stop. However, such processing is not mandatory
because users can manually configure the SGs to achieve the
equivalent.

This patch make the processing of exposed ports configurable.
As a result, it can be disabled if users want a better performance.

Project template 'integrated-gate-py35' was added when OpenStack gate
used to run on xenial distro where python 3.5 is available.

Now we have migrated the gate to Bionic where python 3.6 is available.
With that migration, gate jobs in 'integrated-gate-py35' template are
running on python 3.6 not on 3.5 which makes this template name confusing.

This commit rename 'integrated-gate-py35' to 'integrated-gate-py3'
so that it can convey that template will use available python 3 version
present in used distro.

Renaming the template cannot be done directly as old template name is used in many
project repo and their stable branches. We need to provide new template
'integrated-gate-py3' and once all project will switch to this new
template then, we can remove the old 'integrated-gate-py35' template.

As with change Ia963a093a1b26d90b4de2e8fc623031cf175aece, we can
sometimes cache failed port binding information which we'll see on
startup. Long term, the fix for both issues is to figure out how this is
being cached and stop that happening but for now we simply need to allow
the service to start up.

To this end, we copy the approach in the aforementioned change and
implement a translation function in os_vif_util for unbound which
will make the plug_vifs code raise VirtualInterfacePlugException which
is what the _init_instance code in ComputeManager is already handling.

This has the same caveats as that change, namely that there may be
smarter ways to do this that we should explore. However, that change
also included a note which goes someway to explaining this.

Prior to this change, when the --limit argument is used, each host in the
limit gathers facts for every other host. This is clearly unnecessary, and
can result in up to (N-1)^2 fact gathers.

This change gathers facts for each host only once. Hosts that are not in
the limit are divided between those that are in the limit, and facts are
gathered via delegation.

This change also factors out the fact gathering logic into a separate
playbook that is imported where necessary.

database when they start, depending on timing. In particular, we are
seeing issues in kolla CI currently with jobs timing out waiting for
nova compute services to start. The following error is seen in the nova
logs of these jobs, which may or may not be relevant:

No cells are configured, unable to continue

This change creates the cell0 and cell1 databases prior to starting nova
services.

In order to do this, we must create new containers in which to run the
nova-manage commands, because the nova-api container may not yet exist.
This required adding support to the kolla_docker module for specifying a
command for the container to run that overrides the image's command.

We also add the standard output and error to the module's result when a
non-detached container is run. A secondary benefit of this is that the
output of bootstrap containers is now displayed in the Ansible output if
the bootstrapping command fails, which will help with debugging.

When we shelve offload an instance, we unplug VIFs, delete
the guest from the compute host, etc. The instance is still
logically attached to its ports but they aren't connected
on any host.

When we unshelve an instance, it is scheduled and created
on a potentially new host, in a potentially new availability
zone. During unshelve, the compute manager will call the
setup_instance_network_on_host() method to update the port
host binding information for the new host, but was not
updating the device_owner, which reflects the availability
zone that the instance is in. Because of this, an instance
can be created in az1, shelved, and then unshelved in az2
but the port device_owner still says az1 even though the
port host binding is for a compute host in az2.

This change simply updates the port device_owner when
updating the port binding host during unshelve.

A TODO is left in the cleanup_instance_network_on_host()
method which is called during shelve offload but is currently
not implemented. We should unbind ports when shelve offloading,
but that is a bit of a bigger change and left for a separate
patch since it is not technically needed for this bug fix.

this role will fail to execute on all new nodes due to the existance of
a functioning cluster galera cluster. The first task in the pre-upgrade

In this patch we change the task flow to evaluate whether a service
exists, and if it does then to stop it - otherwise skip that task. This

This API is awkward, inefficient, incoherent, and unintuitive. The bug
fix for which it was originally added was abandoned in favour of a
different approach, so it was never used. It appears that no consumers
are currently calling it. It would be best if none started.

Add a deprecation warning to discourage its use and allow us to remove
it altogether at some point in the future.

In the Ocata release, the physical_network field of ports did not exist.
The safest thing to do is to simply ignore it in this case.

It is also possible for the local_link_connection fields to not have switch_id,
switch_info or port_id attributes, so we now use .get(attr) to avoid an
attribute lookup error.

This change adds a troubleshooting entry for when using service
user tokens would be useful, and links to it from two known

In Id9c4f11b3536e7f9d510f5ef8e6d82a82a96adac we implemented a
failed_when condition to ignore the state of the service stop task
when `galera_ignore_cluster_state=true` is passed through.

Unfortunately, the omit filter does not work in a task context [1],
resulting in the task always failing because the omit placeholder
string is evaluated as true. This makes the task always fail when
running an upgrade.

In this patch we change the task flow to evaluate whether a service
exists, and if it does then to stop it - otherwise skip that task.
This should cater for the rolling replacement use-case and will
work in every other situation too.

As with change Ia963a093a1b26d90b4de2e8fc623031cf175aece, we can
sometimes cache failed port binding information which we'll see on
startup. Long term, the fix for both issues is to figure out how this is
being cached and stop that happening but for now we simply need to allow
the service to start up.

To this end, we copy the approach in the aforementioned change and
implement a translation function in os_vif_util for unbound which
will make the plug_vifs code raise VirtualInterfacePlugException which
is what the _init_instance code in ComputeManager is already handling.

This has the same caveats as that change, namely that there may be
smarter ways to do this that we should explore. However, that change
also included a note which goes someway to explaining this.

When using Scale-Out File Server SMB shares, we have to use the local
share paths instead of the UNC paths if the host is part of the
cluster.

There's an os-win method that allows fetching the shared path but
it expects the share name, while we're passing subdirs as well,
for which reason it fails.

We'll have to make sure we're passing the share name only, appending
the subdir afterwards.
