With a min_part_hours of zero, it's possible to move more than one
replicas of the same part in a single rebalance.

This change in behavior only effects min_part_hour zero rings, which
are understood to be uncommon in production mostly because of this
very specific and strange behavior of min_part_hour zero rings.

With this change, no matter how small your min_part_hours it will
always require at least N rebalances to move N part-replicas of the
same part.

To supplement the existing persisted _last_part_moves structure to
enforce min_part_hours, this change adds a _part_moved_bitmap that
exists only during the life of the rebalance, to track when rebalance
moves a part in order to prevent another replicas of the same part
from being moved in the same rebalance.

Adding constraints support to clients is slightly more complex than
services as the clients themselves are listed in upper-constraints.txt
which leads to errors that you can't install a specific version and a
constrained version.

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper script to
edit the constraints to remove monasca-agent. It also uncaps psutil
which is a temporary workaround for monasca-agent until it is uncapped
globally.

This attempts to provide local.conf support by making it possible to
have local.conf files during initial processing and concattenating
them to the end of the final local.conf.

This is not fool proof, but given the limited ways that we currently
use configs in devstack-gate, it's good enough to start the
transition.

For zmq.DEALER socket there are two round-robin modes exist,
controlled by zmq.IMMEDIATE option. Immediate True means sending
only to running servers and False means to send to all connected
servers (may be not up and running at the moment).

If we do all messaging over DEALER socket as we do for direct
connections, immediate=True better suits for direct CALL/CAST
message types and immediate=False is better for fanout.

This patch fixes things for dynamic connections as for static
we already used the approach.

This change configures the Cinder dlm with this one is zookeeper.
And it installs tooz and the extra dependencies needed for the

To do it, this commit have to introduce a new method for package

When we run galera/mysql packages installation
we can get into dependencies issues with  mysql
client package as it is not installed at the time
when perl dbd module requires it. At the same time
libperl-dbd-mysql is depending on it, so it fails.
Instead we need to ensure that mysql client is installed
along with its libraries prior to installing additional
packages for galera.

The igb_uio.ko needs to be compiled in advance. The devstack

If the igb_uio.ko exists in your system, this bug cannot be identified.

Currently IPMI is not fully supported by OpenBMC. Instead,
OpenBMC's power and boot device is controlled through a
RESTful interface. While IPMI may be a supported mechanism
in the future for OpenBMC, the recommended way to interact
with it will continue to be its RESTful API. This means that
servers running OpenBMC will require a new module to control
its power, a new module to set the boot device, and a hardware
type that has these modules supported. This patch adds
a spec for these items.

A suggested later step would be to mock out all writes

Our current APIVersionRequest object has an is_null method to check when
the version instance is null (major=None and minor=None).

While this works it is not very pythonic, since you have to write
expressions such as:

 if not min_version and not max_version:
     return True
 elif ((min_version and max_version) and
       max_version.is_null() and min_version.is_null()):
     return True

This patch removes the is_null method and instead implements the truth
value testing to simplify expressions and make code more pythonic.

So previous code would just look like:

 if not min_version and not max_version:
     return True

Because this will work with min_version being None or being an
APIVersionRequest instance with major=None and minor=None.

We have to query neutron several times during the boot process to
validate the user's network_request. Currently we don't share state
between these various calls until network_info_cache is created.

To pass information between validate_networks, create_ports and
allocate_for_instance phases, we are creating a new object called
ProcessedNetworkRequest, that contains a NetworkRequest object.

Eventually this will mean when we create a port in one phase the next
phase can tell between a pre-existing port passed in by a user and the
new port that has been created by Nova, that should be deleted when the
instance is deleted.

TODO - this is just some initial stabs in the code at where the changes
need to go. Its likely this could just get rolled into the existing
NetworkRequest object, but for now its separate just for clarity.

Instead of passing in the raw dict of ports from neutron, instead pass
in the new ProcessedNetworkRequestList object. Also populate the object
with a mac_address so _filter_hypervisor_macs gets what it needs.

This now means _validate_req_and_create_ports no longer needs to return
the raw ports from neutron. Win.

Lots of the test fixes are about using real mac addresses, now we use an
object that validates the fields correctly. There are also some bad
default return values for ports, now that gets used.

We need to stop passing into _update_ports_for_instance the raw dict we

A step towards that is adding network_dns_name into the existing
versioned object we are passing in, and stop passing network into both
_populate_neutron_extension_values and _update_port_dns_name

We need to split out the port create into a separate function from the
bits of allocate_for_instance that happen after it, so we have the ports
created before we call the scheduler, so we know if IP addresses need to
be scheduled or not.

As such, we are making sure all the information from the create ports
phase is objectified, and then pass that into the update ports phase and
the refresh info cache phase.

So we start with the _update_ports_for_instance, and converting the
requests_and_created_ports argument.

- Is the library actively maintained?

  The last commit in the library was almost a year ago but the owner of
  the library is active on github. The code base itself is not large 1k
  LOC and all the promised features are implemented.

- Is the library good code?

  Yes, the code looks good and tested.

- Is the library python 3 compatible?

  Yes.

- Is the library license compatible?

  Yes, package is licensed as 3-clause BSD.

- Is the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu
  latest / Fedora latest)?

  No but it is available on PyPI.

- Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries
  in ``global-requirements.txt``?

  I could not find any other package in the requirements that allows
  definition of models, and is able to serialize them to python natives
  primitives and JSON.

- Is the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or
  infrastructure setup? (Answer to this should be Yes, of course)
  Which?

  We would like to use this library in Dragonflow to implement model
  classes with JSON as their backend.

Adding constraints support to libraries is slightly more complex than
services as the libraries themselves are listed in upper-constraints.txt
which leads to errors that you can't install a specific version and a
constrained version.

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper script to
edit the constraints to remove os-brick.

Finally, it also adds libxml2 and libxslt to bindep.txt for use when
building cryptography.

After patch 416771 is merged, we change to use registered tricircle
command to start our api and xjob instead of python script, this
introduces a problem that eventlet.monkey_patch is not correctly
executed so xjob fails to handle RPC request.

2. What is the solution to the problem
Directly execute eventlet.monkey_patch in cmd/xjob.py without
checking if it's imported as a module or run by python script.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle

The python construct lib can be used to facilitate parsing of binary data,
for example network protocols.  It is documented here:
http://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

An example of this library in openstack is in parsing network
switch LLDP data as implemented here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/406496/.
It simplifies the description of the LLDP structures and makes parsing of bit
and byte fields relatively straightforward.

The construct lib is licensed under the MIT license.  It supports Python 2.7
and 3.5.

This lib appears to be actively maintained, the latest release was on
12/31/16 in the git repository
https://github.com/construct/construct/releases.

This change adds the ability to specify regular expressions to define a
customised versioning scheme for release tags and pre-release tags.

By default this change supports the current versioning scheme used by
OpenStack.

To customise, update the config.yaml file with the appropriate values.
For example, for tags with versions like 'v1.0.0' and pre-release
versions like 'v1.0.0rc1' the following could be added to config.yaml:

release_tag_re: 'v\d\.\d\.\d(rc\d+)?'

Analysis: While attaching volume to instance, Nova calls
connect_volume, this returns connection_info which
includes 'device_path' that shows the device path in computer host.
With encrypted volume, after the above steps,it needs to decrypt
the device.It creates a decrypted device with 'cryptsetup open',and
then make device_path in connection_info refer
to the new decrypted device.

When rebooting an instance, Nova instance is shut down without any
detaching operations. This seems incorrect, ideally it should detach
encryptor when powering off, and re-attach when starting.

Caused by this ovs commit:
https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/84d0ca5d00fe01b29163236d48fa0f9105687149
To improve security, the NB and SB ovsdb daemons no longer
have open ptcp connections by default.  This is a change in
behavior from previous versions, users wishing to use TCP
connections to the NB/SB daemons can either request that
a passive TCP connection be used via ovn-ctl command-line
options (e.g. via OVN_CTL_OPTS/OVN_NORTHD_OPTS in startup
scripts):
    --db-sb-create-insecure-remote=yes
    --db-nb-create-insecure-remote=yes

Thus add option to devstack:
    --db-nb-create-insecure-remote=$DB_NB_INSECURE_REMOTE
    --db-sb-create-insecure-remote=$DB_SB_INSECURE_REMOTE

As disussed in project plan, we decided to adopt etcd to store
container data which is faster and more flexible than mysql.

This commit enable etcd DB backend testing pipeline in Zun
and adjust the code correspondingly:

1. Set the value of 'db_type' to 'etcd' when runing etcd
   pipeline: 'gate-zun-devstack-dsvm-docker-etcd-nv'.
2. Drop the 'get_XXX_by_id' methods from etcd API since 'id'
   attribute makes no sense in etcd data model.
3. Adjust DB related test cases.
4. Make etcd write request thead-safe.

After the etcd related code been well tested, we'll change the
default DB type from 'mysql' to 'etcd'.

The point of the delete_image_on_error decorator is to
cleanup an image used during snapshot operations, so it
makes little sense to log an exception trace if the image
delete fails because the image no longer exists, which it
might not since _snapshot_instance method will proactively
delete non-active images in certain situations.

So let's just handle the ImageNotFound and ignore it.

If 'RECREATE_KEYSTONE_DB=False' database won't be recreated.
It would be useful for multinode Grenade tests for Keystone. This parameter
will help us to deploy multiple services on different machines talking to
the same DB.

Devstack recreates Keystone DB each time during Keystone service installation.
If our controller node is already deployed, Keystone DB already contains
important information about OpenStack services and their endpoints. When
the second Keystone node is being deployed, we don't want to delete
records about controllers' services endpoints.

This patch makes OVS and Linuxbridge interface drivers to set MTU on
plug() attempt if the device already exists. This helps when network MTU
changes (which happens after some configuration file changes).

This will allow to update MTU values on agent restart, without the need
to bind all ports to new nodes, that would involve migrating agents. It
will also help in case when you have no other nodes to migrate to (in
single node mode).

Both OVS and Linuxbridge interface drivers are updated.

Other drivers (in-tree IVS as well as 3party drivers) will use the
default set_mtu implementation, that only warns about the missing
feature (once per process startup).

DocImpact suggest to restart agents after MTU config changes instead of
          rewiring router/DHCP ports.

There have been some requests to enable this, and although it's not
something we should enable by default, this shows how you can use
the generic NodeUserData interface to have cloud-init do it.

To use this you create an environment file like:

resource_registry:
  OS::TripleO::NodeUserData: path/to/userdata_root_password.yaml
parameter_defaults:
  NodeRootPassword: insecure_changeme

Obviously this isn't that secure, and thus isn't intended for
production environments, but it may be useful for debugging and
as a further example showing how to configure things via cloud-init.

not imply that x!=y is false. Accordingly, when defining __eq__(),

Since the deploy guide moved to a separate directory structure, relative
links throughout the docs have been pointing to nothing. This change
applies some logic to figure out the correct format for URLs based on
the current branch and the deploy guide/dev docs conventions.

The actual link generation is done via the sphinx.ext.extlinks
extension, which allows for defining custom link generation roles. This
achieves the desired behavior in terms of dynamic link construction, but
does alter the standard linking conventions.

Another side effect is that docs generate this way will always point
to the live URLs, not to HTML generated for a gate job. It may be
worthwhile using relative links within the deploy guide/developer docs
and only using these automatic external ones for cross-references.

Usage for dev docs looks like this:

    :dev_docs:`Link title text <last-part-of-url.html>`

And for the deploy guide:

    :deploy_guide:`Link title text <last-part-of-url.html>`

Some examples inline have been provided, to demonstrate how these fit in
different contexts.

Some small code style fixes are also included.

Some time ago we added new entity ""exporters"". For task we created a command
""rally task export"" which allows to export task results to external systems.
Exporters can ""easily"" extende by plugins.

In case of verification component, proper command wasn't created yet. While I
thing idea of exporters is good enough, implementation can be improved.
To simplify usage, entity ""exporters"" was renamed to ""reporters"" and
integrated with ""rally verify report"" command. Generation of regular rally
reports (like html, json) is done in the same way as in plugabble reporters.

Proposed interface:

  rally verify report --uuid <uuid-1> [<uuid-2>...<uuid-n>] \
      --type <reporter-name> --to <destination>

Examples of usage:

  rally verify report --uuid some-uuid --type html --to /path/to/save

  # such exporter is not implemented yet, but we expect it soon
  rally verify report --uuids some-uuid --type elasticsearch \
      --to https://username@passwd:example.com

When HA routers are deleted, neutron-keepalived-state-change was
killed by l3/ha_router using SIGKILL and orphaning its child process
'ip -o monitor'.

This patch implements a way to kill it gracefully through SIGTERM, and
also sending a SIGKILL if keepalived-state-change didn't die after a
10 seconds timeout. The SIGTERM handler in keepalived-state-change
kills the ip monitor process using SIGKILL.

It kills ip_monitor PID using kill instead of through IPMonitor.stop()
because the monitor runs as root and keepalived-state-change doesn't
(it drops its privileges after launching the monitor). Doing so, would
lead to a ""Permission denied"". We can safely kill the monitor this way
since it was started with respawn_interval set to None which means that
it won't be automatically respawned.

This patch will kill processes that are listening on any port/UNIX
socket within the namespace to be cleaned up. To kill them it will
issue a SIGTERM to them (or to their parents if they were forked) and,
if they don't die after a few seconds, a SIGKILL to them and all their
children.

This is intended for those cases when there's no specific cleanup and
serves as a fallback method.

There isn't good docs or a guide on what we're looking for with
normalization - so rather than nitpick a review to death, I just made a
patch. We should make a doc ...

Changes included:
- We need to be explicit about every key we're going to support. Some of
  the limits keys are deprecated, so just don't return them.
- Change them all from camel case to underscore to match other
  resources.
- Document them in model.rst
- Change the name from limits to compute_limits, since it's only limits
  for the compute service.
- Allow usage by a normal user (it's not an admin function)

There will be a follow up patch to convert this to direct rest calls,
which will be fun due to the ability of this to work against other
projects.
