This patch builds up from the last in the chain and implements
an initial version of the _elect_leader code in the sharder.

Currently the auto-sharding has been implemented to search for x shards,
add them, and then next round find the next x. So scanning takes a while.
With the OP driven sharding, we scan for _all_ the shard ranges and then
insert them. This seems to be working even on large containers.
I wonder if we should do the same in auto sharding? Scan for them all,
check to see if we are still the leader (the authority on shard ranges)
and if so insert them.
By using the db state we can make a decison. I.E if one of the other
primaries are already in the the SHARDING or SHARDED state then the
election should fail as someone else has inserted something (an OP
or a split brain leader election thing).

We are being very safe, initially using an ALL primary majority. This
could mean that on very large containers by the time the leader has
finally scanned all ranges and ready to insert, a rebalance may have
taken place and potentially a new leader will need to start again.
Turns out if we ever get into a state that means the container can't
progress then we have the OP tool to fall back on.

An ELECT call returns a json response in the form of:

  {""node"": <index 0 node dict from ring>,
   ""part"": <ring partition>,
   ""status"": <db status>,
   ""version"": <ring version>}

The current implementation goes something like this:
 - Send an ELECT call to all other primaries and gather responses.
 - Decide if I am the scanner based on some all the responses, including
my own. These entail:
    ~ False if number of responses is < quorum
    ~ If there is more then one index 0 node (comparing only IP and
      PORT) then filter the responses to only those with the latest ring
      version[0].
    ~ False if any of the responses are in SHARDING or SHARDED state.
    ~ Make sure at least a quorum of responses are UNSHARDED[1]
    ~ True if there is still a quorum of responses that think it's me[2]
    ~ otherwise return false

This obviously only works in a scan all ranges scenario, currently the
code hasn't been modified to this, it's still X by X mode.

[0] - If there is a new ring version it might not effect our primaries,
so if they all agree it's me regardless on ring version then great
(though I haven't added a return True here yet cause still not
convinced).

[1] - At the moment we on ALL quorum, if this ever changes we want a
quorum of primaries to agree noting that we'd have bombed out if we found
any in the SHARDING or SHARDED state. Why this then, if we hit a node
that doesn't have the DB (either because it's new or it's replicated it
away already) then the db state will be NOTFOUND. But it still has a
ring so should know who it thinks index 0 should be, so maybe it's vote
still means something.

[2] - This guy is convinced he is index 0, so just confirming, if it
isn't then _elect_leader will return false (ie well it isn't me then).

Paunch was deprecated in Ussuri and is now being retired, to be fully
replaced by the new tripleo-ansible role, tripleo_container_manage.

This patch:

- Removes common/container-puppet.py (was only useful when paunch is
  enabled, since that script was converted to container_puppet_config
  Ansible module in tripleo-ansible).
- Update all comments refering to paunch, and replace by
  tripleo_container_manage.
- Deprecate EnablePaunch parameter.
- Remove paunch as python dependencies.

This patch is starting to set up the code to support
auto-sharding 2.0. This is the start of a patch chain
that will attempt to implement what was discussed at
the PTG in denver[0].

The next auto-shard version will continue to use Sam's
index 0 node to be the leader, but will also use ring
version counter to strip ignore any old nodes in the cluster.
This will require some quorum checks with other primary nodes.

The general plan is:
  - The scanner will use a 2 phase check.
  - And a mix of historic versions 1 and 2:
    1. The scanner will use the 2 phase checking.
          am I index 0 > scan > am I still the scanner > commit shard ranges
    2. Use Sam's index 0, but also include the ring version when making a decision,
       as a way to discredit old primaries that are now handoff nodes
       (if they don't agree with the latest ring version).
  - To start with be extra cautious. NOT majority quorum _all_ primary quorum.
  - Response from each primary during quorum check will be:
    1. who do you think index 0 is AND
    2. what is your current ring version.

The autosharding needs to preperations. More info needs to be referencable from
the ring, this has been pulled out into Tim's patch 670673, namely the ring version.

And secondly, creates an ELECT verb in the continer server that will
pull in the ring (when needed) and return a response with a json body
containing the node, partition and ring version that the sharder will
need to make a decision.

There is also a small amount of prep in the sharder.

Note, even this first patch is WIP, there was still tests and
documentation updates required to it before we can even think of landing
it.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

When building the docker image attempt to apply the git branch and git
tag as a docker hub tags. The code seems to suggest looping through the
tags, so if the git change doesn't have, say a tag, then it should be ''
and therefore not applied.

The downside I can see is that every change has a branch (stable or
master) so it might make the latest tag not be updated anymore.

I've only looked briefly at the code, so not sure will actually work.
But hoping it will ;)

project, which run them when bindep.txt changes.

https://review.opendev.org/731394 moved the build-wheel-mirror-base
job/playbook/role into openstack-zuul-jobs, renamed as
build-wheel-cache-* to a) distinguish the name and b) make it a little
clearer that we're building the wheels that goes on the mirror, rather
than passing through to mirroring something existing.

This updates the job names in project-config to reference these new
jobs.

Note the publishing steps are kept here along with the AFS secret.

to customize the openrc scripts that users may be downloading from
Horizon, e.g., to change authentication methods or add additional

This reverts commit 3f1314674d59bca6e9d0e43d4d479bb04f20aca1.

Turns out this causes problems for consuming code. Even if that
consuming code has unit tests that don't touch os-brick, because
tenacity is loaded when os-brick code is loaded, by the time
the consuming code mocks out the sleep call it is too late. So
any code that uses retries will end up actually sleeping and
retrying, often timing out the unit test because it takes too
long to complete.

This will have to be readdressed once a better way is figured
out for being able to safely mock these retry sleep calls.

The extant roles are not really right.  They run in periodic and poll
tarballs to see if they should build anything.  They are not gate
tested.  I do not know why I did it like this; but it was a long time
ago.

We should have roles that build in the check gate, and upload only
when the client version changes.

Additionally, I found that the upstream .srpm we were building from is
not quite right; it won't build on ARM64 for example due to the way
it's autoconf machinery has been generated.  The best way is to build
your own srpm from the upstream source using the method linked in this
change.

This builds and publishes artifacts for centos7 x86 and centos8
arm64/x86.  A follow-on will publish these.

This switching our retry mechanism over from the retrying library to the

appears to be no longer maintained.

This has a small behavior change in that before we were applying an

happens, but retries will exponentially back off with each retry.

I think there's some argument to make for processing request params to
primitive types as early as possible but since _should_auto_create
supports a ternary behavior (None, True, False) it seems better to lean
towards consolidation of logic.

The json_plugin tests read the localhost name in a different way
to how the hostname is fetched in the Monasca Agent check. This can
cause these tests to fail since the hostnames may differ. For example,
only one may contain .home as a suffix. In this change we avoid reading
the hostname from the system running the tests.

The requirements repo is support python 3.5 as oldest python version

thus, requirements-check will fail on a couple of lines in swift.  The
check is only run when these files are touched.

The py2.7 packagers we know about aren't depending on upstream
requirements.txt for correctness and aside from all the production
deployments running on py2.7 we only realistically support >=py3.7

There's no good reason for our requirements.txt to be ""unspported"" by
the openstack requirements check job.  Since they only support >=py3.5
we can change our requirements.txt inline with that.  This should be
fine for everything we could hope to get out of both our
requirements.txt and the check!

This reverts commit ff1361b2bea59dba8dcac5e15f925f8ecc100d13.

This has broken the pacemaker setup part of the upgrade process,
so we need to revert it and revisit the idempotency.

send two global request id header

Example: https://zuul.opendev.org/t/openstack/build/c5b1debf78df4aa3bdda34f0b4c53c37/log/testrepository.subunit#2385

This is becasue of the header not being Case Insensitive
and end up with two different name of same header with difference
of cap 'D'.

Unit test for whether request global-request-id has precedence
over adapter fail many times because of how different python version
treat the dict. py3.6 and above are all good as dict maintain the
insertion ordered but py3.5 can fail it any time.

We can see consistent failure in py35 jobs:

Switch to openstackdocstheme 2.2.1 and reno 3.1.0 versions. Using
these versions will allow especially:
* Linking from HTML to PDF document
* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

Squashed two changes together since both are needed to fix jobs:

Resolve PEP8

No idea how this happened, but reviews started failing the
pep8 gate job. The failures are legitimate, see the commit.
I guess the pep8 tests became smarter and found these issues.

(cherry picked from commit 52ff421e3d339f81c2625bff429e6829a2d9af67)

Add libc6-dev to bindep

The python-builder base image was updated to no longer install
recommends. This is inline with the other Infra images and keeps
image sizes smaller. gcc recommended libc6-dev - but it turns out
we need that for limits.h for one of our depends. Add it to fix
our image builds.

EC2 token requests contain a signature that signs the entire request,
including the access timestamp. While the signature is checked, the
timestamp is not, and so these signed requests remain valid
indefinitely, leaving the token API vulnerable to replay attacks. This
change introduces a configurable TTL for signed token requests and
ensures that the timestamp is actually validated against it.

The check will work for either an AWS Signature v1/v2 'Timestamp'
parameter[1] or the AWS Signature v4 'X-Aws-Date' header or
parameter[2].

Although this technically adds a new feature and the default value of
the feature changes behavior, this change is required to protect
credential holders and therefore must be backported to all supported
branches.

When a service is stopped using ""service_kill"" script and the
namespace where the container is running does not exist, the
container process should be forced to stop from the root namespace.

A namespace where a process is running, can be deleted whitout
stopping the mentioned process. ""ip netns identify <PID>"" then
returns an empty string (root namespace).

If the namespace where a container was executed is deleted,
""service_kill"" script should execute a container related command
from the root namespace. To access to the root namespace from
inside a container, running in another namespace, it is necessary
to gain access via ""nsenter"", specifying the parameter ""--all"" to
access to all namespaces of the target process.

This patch will prevent an endless loop in Neutron DHCP agent. As
reported in the related bug, when a DHCP agent is resync, the DHCP
helper (metadata proxy) is stopped. In case this process stop raises
an exception (for example if the namespace does not exist), schedules
again a resync, creating an endless loop.

This patch combines [1] and [2] in this repository.

This patch is making the transaction from the _delete_port() method in
OVNClient more resilient to errors where elements from that transaction
have already been deleted by another change in the database.

Prior to this patch, a few places could potentially raise RowNotFound
which would abort the whole transaction and would leave the a stable
port for being cleaned up after by the maintenance thread. This patch
tries to catch those exceptions that could potentially fail the
transaction.

When a resize is confirmed the instance does not belong to the source
compute any more. In the past the scheduler instance info is only
updated by the _sync_scheduler_instance_info periodic. This caused that
server boots with anti-affinity did not consider the source host.
But now at the end of the confirm_resize call the compute also updates
the scheduler about the move.

Previous versions of jsonschema (<3.2.0) doesn't support python 3.8 [1].
Python 3.8 is part of the victoria supported runtimes [2] so we now force
to use jsonschema version 3.2.0 to avoid issues, remove ambiguity and ensure
that everything works with python 3 in general.

Switch to openstackdocstheme 2.2.1 and reno 3.1.0 versions. Using
these versions will allow especially:
* Linking from HTML to PDF document
* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

Consider the following object hierarchy:

  Foo
    id (IntegerField)

  Bar
    id (IntegerField)
    foo (ObjectField(Foo))

One can serialize the 'Bar' object by calling the 'obj_to_primitive'
method of a 'Bar' instance, which will call 'to_primitive' for each
field on the object. In the case of the 'foo' field, because it's an
'ObjectField', this will in turn call a 'obj_to_primitive' method again,
only this time the one from 'Foo', leading to additional calls to
various 'to_primitive' functions and, if necessary, additional
'obj_to_primitive' calls.

Things should work quite similarly for deserialization. One can
deserialize a serialized 'Bar' instance by calling the
'obj_from_primitive' class method of 'Bar', which will call
'from_primitive' for each field. Once again, 'ObjectField' instances
result in additional calls to a 'obj_from_primitive' class method.
However, here things diverge. While serialization will result in a call
to the 'obj_to_primitive' method of the object in the field, or the
""child"" object, deserialization results in a call to the
'obj_from_primitive' class method of the ""parent"" object. This means
objects that override the 'obj_from_primitive' method will not see the
correct overriden behavior when the object is embedded in another
object.

The solution is simple. The 'obj_from_primitive' class method is split
into two: the existing 'obj_from_primitive' class method and a new
'obj_class_from_primitive' method, which does the lookup of the child
object within the same namespace as the parent object. The expectation
is that users can continue to override the latter, while the former
should remain untouched.

The apt package manager uses the underlying dpkg functions which in
turn make heavy use of fsync() during package installations.

The time taken to install packages can be roughly halved by converting
fsync() to a no-op via libeatmydata. This is common practice during
the building of CD images, chroots and package building with pbuilder.

The default security group normally includes a rule that allows packets that
originate from the same subnet where the VM is connected:

  direction: ingress, ether_type: IPv4, remote_ip_prefix: ""0.0.0.0/0""
  remote_group_id:   <UUID_OF_SEC_GROUP>  <-- same as security_group_id
  security_group_id: <UUID_OF_SEC_GROUP>  <-- same as remote_group_id

  direction: ingress, ether_type: IPv6, remote_ip_prefix: ""::/0""
  remote_group_id:   <UUID_OF_SEC_GROUP>  <-- same as security_group_id
  security_group_id: <UUID_OF_SEC_GROUP>  <-- same as remote_group_id

OVN translates them into ACLS that look like:

  to-lport 1002 (outport == @<PG_ID> && ip4 && ip4.src == $<PG_ID>_ip4) allow
  to-lport 1002 (outport == @<PG_ID> && ip6 && ip6.src == $<PG_ID>_ip6) allow

A caveat here is that Openstack operators may chosse remove these rules. As VMs
may use IPv4 DHCP to boot, the removal of these security group rules means that
connectivity to DHCP responder (aka ovn-controller) needs to be ensured via an
explicit rule that is not removable by Openstack operators. That is the purpose
of the DHCP rules of the OVN's subnet port group. This particular port group is
automatically created/removed as subnets are added and they contain the following
ACL as part of creation:

  from-lport  1002 (inport == @pg_<OVN_PG_ID_FOR_IPv4_SUBNET> && ip4 &&
  ip4.dst == {255.255.255.255, <SUBNET_PREFIX>} && udp && udp.src == 68 &&
  udp.dst == 67) allow

This change re-introduces (and fixes) the subnet port group, which was removed in
bug #1790900.

Switch to openstackdocstheme 2.2.1 version. Using
this version will allow especially:
* Linking from HTML to PDF document
* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

Switch to openstackdocstheme 2.2.1 and reno 3.1.0 versions. Using
these versions will allow especially:
* Linking from HTML to PDF document
* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

deployments running on py2.7 we only realistically support >=py3.7

There's no good reason for our requirements.txt to be ""unspported"" by
the openstack requirements check job.  Since they only support >=py3.5
we can change our requirements.txt inline with that.  This should be
fine for everything we could hope to get out of both our
requirements.txt and the check!

EC2 token requests contain a signature that signs the entire request,
including the access timestamp. While the signature is checked, the
timestamp is not, and so these signed requests remain valid
indefinitely, leaving the token API vulnerable to replay attacks. This
change introduces a configurable TTL for signed token requests and
ensures that the timestamp is actually validated against it.

The check will work for either an AWS Signature v1/v2 'Timestamp'
parameter[1] or the AWS Signature v4 'X-Aws-Date' header or
parameter[2].

Although this technically adds a new feature and the default value of
the feature changes behavior, this change is required to protect
credential holders and therefore must be backported to all supported
branches.

b. add the ability to always issue new tls.key as part of the key

Without this patch, when an OAuth1 request token is authorized with a
limited set of roles, the roles for the access token are ignored when
the user uses it to request a keystone token. This means that user of an
access token can use it to escallate their role assignments beyond what
was authorized by the creator. This patch fixes the issue by ensuring
the token model accounts for an OAuth1-scoped token and correctly
populating the roles for it.

Modified to work with older test helper function:

  keystone/tests/unit/test_v3_oauth1.py

Conflicts:

  keystone/models/token_model.py

  The keystone token model was refactored in the Rocky release. This
  commit only backports the test so that we have test coverage against
  the bug and proves there wasn't a regression in Queens. As such, the
  code changes to token_model.py (where the bug was introduced) are not
  applicable to Pike.

  releasenotes/notes/bug-1873290-ff7f8e4cee15b75a.yaml

  Removed the release note since there isn't anything to signal to
  operators regarding a vulnerability. We're only adding test coverage
  to prove that stable/queens isn't vulnerable.

Currently nova doesn't support new container format
'compressed'. And if we're trying to create a new instance
directly from a image which is in 'compressed' container
format, creation will be done successfully. However this
instance is not really valid.

This patch is to simply abort instance creation directly from
image if container_format of the image is 'compressed'.

server with image in 'compressed' format.

Switch to openstackdocstheme 2.2.1 and reno 3.1.0 versions. Using

Update Sphinx version as well.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used

The N319 check previously asserted that debug-level logs were not
translated. Now that we've removed all log translations, we can
generalize this to all logs. We reuse the same number since these
numbers are really just metadata and not public contracts.

This also allows us to update the N323 and N326 checks, which ensure we
import the translation function, '_', wherever it's used and don't
concatenate translated and non-translated strings. Since we're no longer
translating logs and the '_LE', '_LW' and '_LI' symbols are no longer
provided, we don't need to consider logs in either of these cases.

doing this is as follows:

[defaults]
gathering = smart
fact_caching = jsonfile
fact_caching_connection = ./facts
fact_caching_timeout = 86400

This does not affect Kolla Ansible however, since we use the setup
module which unconditionally gathers facts regardless of the state of
the cache. This gets worse with large inventories limited to a small
batch of hosts via --limit or serial, since the limited hosts must
gather facts for all others.

One way to detect whether facts exist for a host is via the
'module_setup' variable, which exists only when facts exist. This change
uses the 'module_setup' fact to determine whether facts need to be
gathered for hosts outside of the batch. For hosts in the batch, we
switch from using the setup module to gather_facts on the play, which
can use the 'smart' gathering logic.

* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.
