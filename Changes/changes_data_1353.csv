If account autocreation is on and the proxy receives a GET request for
a nonexistent account, it'll fake up a response that makes it look as
if the account exists, but without reifying that account into sqlite
DB files.

That faked-out response was just fine as long as you wanted a
text/plain response, but it didn't handle the case of format=json or
format=xml; in those cases, the response would still be
text/plain. This can break clients, and certainly causes crashes in

accidentally diverge. There's also a new probe test for that
non-divergence.

Also, cleaned up a redundant matching of the Accept header in the code
for generating the account listing.

Note that some of the added tests here pass with or without this code
change; they were added because the code I was changing (parts of the
real account GET) wasn't covered by tests.

Qpid has a limitation where it cannot serialize a dict containing
a string greater than 65535 characters.  This change alters the
Qpid implementation to JSON encode the dict before sending it, but
only if Qpid would fail to serialize it.  This maintains as much

If you include a dependency URL in your requirements file that has an
egg fragment e.g.

  http://tarballs.openstack.org/oslo.config/oslo.config-1.2.0a2.tar.gz#egg=oslo.config

we include the full URL in dependency_links (as you'd expect), but also
include the egg fragment in our requires.

With oslo.config, we're seeing a situation where 1.1.1 is installed and,
while pip knows that 1.2.0a2 is available (via dependency_links),
because our requires only say 'oslo.config' and we haven't passed
--upgrade, then pip sees the requirement as satisfied and doesn't
install 1.2.0a2.

here's where you can find it"" so, for example, we'll be happy if a newer
version is installed or available from pypi but, if not, then we'll
install from the supplied URL.

Now, egg fragments can be versioned e.g.

  http://tarballs.openstack.org/oslo.config/oslo.config-1.2.0a2.tar.gz#egg=oslo.config-1.2.0a2

but we need to transform the fragment so our requires becomes:

  oslo.config>=1.2.0a2

We should be fine for a backwards compatibility perspective, because
an egg fragment which included a hyphen just wouldn't have worked.

This is just a reimplementation of the work David Hadas is doing at:

https://review.openstack.org/#/c/30481/

This rework was mainly just so I could get my head around what the
state of things were, what state we were trying to get them in, and
what was required to get it there. I felt some things were not quite
right with David's work, but I was at a loss to explain why.
Hopefully this will help when I re-review his work.

I'm mainly posting this up so other reviewers of David's work might
get a better view into things from a different perspective and
consider some of the ideas here as alternatives.

This is an area to tread lightly. The starting state of things is a
mess and the ending state should be cleaner, even if not ""perfect"".

Now, I do like this approach better (of course, I wrote it :P) but
let me state why:

* No all-in-one functions. I know this is what David wanted, but I
  disagree. I find the all-in-ones harder to read and easier to make
  mistakes with when in use elsewhere. Having them separate doesn't
  prevent making an all-in-one that calls the separate functions for
  convenience, but honestly, is a quick ""if container:
  container_func() else: account_func()"" that much harder to type or
  read?

* No ""magic"" HEADs that happen to set the cache values and, if they
  don't, blow things up. If I implement a stand-in proxy app, I
  wouldn't expect to have to feed a cache when implementing my HEAD
  functionality. With this approach, the caching stays in the caching
  functions and they fail gracefully.

* Account autocreation happens only within controllers/account.py
  Everyone else just indicates they're asking for account information
  in order to perform a pending write and the account is autocreated
  if configured to so.

I used comments liberally in this patch set to help a reviewer
understand what changed and why. A final patch set would be needed to
clear out these comments as they're mostly just noise after the fact,
though it should probably be a separate review/merge so that the
history isn't completely lost.

I was especially careful to alter the existing tests as little as
possible and to comment liberally again when I had to change things.
If this were to truly be a candidate for merging, new tests for the
new functions and functionality would need to be added.

One last note: We need to fix our test paths! Wow, talk about a lot
of screwy paths. All over the place we use paths like '/a/c' when we
should have used '/v1/a/c'. The tests happened to pass all this time
because so much relied on controller.account_name and .container_name
and not PATH_INFO. But we really need to fix these paths at some
point.

Fixes bug #1176817

The API enforces a special requirement for CLI options - they must be
registered before the command line is parsed.

This means that as we parse the command line - and parse config files
specified on the command line - we can fully process CLI options whether
we find values for them on the command line or in config files.

This allows us to fundamentally change how we reconcile values specified
on the CLI with values specified in config files. No longer do we have
to first look at the set of values found on the command line and then
look at the values found in config files. Instead, we can treat all
values for CLI options as if they were found on the command line, even
if they were actually found in config files.

The long and short of this is that if you do:

  --config-file foo.conf --blaa --config-file bar.conf

then '--blaa' will override any value for the 'blaa' option in foo.conf
but we can also override the 'blaa' value on the command line from
within bar.conf.

Fixes bug 1174433

This fix adds a rollback of the OVS plugin update_port operation
following a failure to update the port in the Cisco Nexus sub-plugin.

Also, this fix removes an unneccessary call to the Nexus sub-plugin's
update_network method within the Cisco plugin model layer's
update_network method (as well as the associated argument setup).
The Nexus sub-plugin's update_network is a no-op, so there's no
need to call it.

Add an rbd_ceph_conf options to mirror glance configuration, and use
the existing rbd_user option to choose how to connect to the cluster
instead of relying on an environment variable.  Use these settings
when running command line programs and when connecting via librados.

Use absolute imports so that importing the python librbd bindings
via 'import rbd' does not try to import cinder.drivers.rbd again.

Create some convenience wrappers to simplify librbd and librados
error handling and cleanup. Using these everywhere also simplifies
testing. Mock out all the librados and librbd calls in the tests
so these libraries don't need to be installed.

Remove the local_path() method since it's never used. It was
left over from nova-volume.

There are only three things still relying on the command line:
- importing an image
- exporting to an image
- getting monitor addresses

Importing and exporting on the command line include zero-detection
that would be little benefit to replicate here. librados and librbd
don't have a simple interface to obtain the monitor addresses, so
leave that to a command line tool as well.

usage: keystone user-create [--tenant-id <tenant-id>] [--pass <pass>]
                            [--email <email>] [--enabled <true|false>]
                            <user-name>

Create new user

Positional arguments:
  <user-name>           New user name (must be unique)

Optional arguments:
  --tenant-id <tenant-id>
                        New user default tenant
  --pass <pass>         New user password
  --email <email>       New user email address
  --enabled <true|false>
                        Initial user enabled status (default true)

Now username will be shown as mandatory.

The quantum.quantum_plugin_base_v2 module had some good docstrings,
but there was no corresponding sphinx code that would generate
docs from them. There were also some syntax issues with the
sphinx markup in the docstrings.

This change adds sphinx directives so these docs will be auto-

to ensure we do not fill up a complete memcache page and cause
token issuing/revoking to fail.  The flush only occurs if a memcache
page is full when a new token is issued with exception
to the list functions if the max_user_list_size option is set to a
non-zero value.

The dummy memcache driver will now behave a bit more like a
real memcache (where the data stored in the cache isn't modified
when a reference to the original data/get of data is changed).

New options added:
* max_user_record_list_size:
        maximum size of the user_record holding the references to
        the actual tokens. This is only relevant when a call to
        token_api.list_tokens() is made. A value of 0 indicates
        we do not care about the list size and will only
        flush if the memcache page is full

* max_compare_and_set_retry:
        The number of retries that will be attempted when performing
        an update of the user_record or the revocation-list record.
        This is relevant due to the use of CAS (compare and set)
        function of the memcache client. This allows for multiple
        keystone processes/wsgi/etc to run without worry of race
        conditions clobbering the lists.

This patch adds some logic that is currently duplicated throughout
Openstack. As part of this de-duplication, the patch also modifies
current implementation.

Major Changes:
    * check, set_rules, reset, init are now part of the Enforcer class
    * check was renamed into enforce
    * init was renamed into load_rules
    * It is now possible to load multiple files and have per instance
      rules instead of global rules.
    * There's a global instance of the Enforcer class that can be used as
      main enforcer.

        from openstack.common import policy
        ENFORCER = policy.ENFORCER
        ENFORCER.enforce(rule, target, creds)

Minor Changes:
    * Added do_raise to the enforce method
    * Enforcer instance is now passed to the Check call.

NOTE: If / once this patch gets in, I'll update other projects and port
them to the latest version.

Fixes bug #1184941

openstack.common.log gives a mechanism to configure logging and, by
default, we will set up a handler on root logger. Using pecan to also
configure a handler on the 'ironic' logger means every log message gets
logged to console twice.

It seems that the pecan logging configuration stuff is redundant with
our existing logging configuration infrastructure.

When using ImagePollster to poll image status from Glance, there might
be duplicate image status event recorded down if there are private
images together with public images stored in Glance.

In Glance, the get image list API looks like:
    def _get_images(self, context, filters, **params):
        ...
 # NOTE(markwash): for backwards compatibility, is_public=True for
 # admins actually means ""treat me as if I'm not an admin and show
 # all my images""
        if context.is_admin and params.get('is_public') is True:
            context.is_admin = False
            del params['is_public']
        ...
The above code shows that if a user is of 'admin_role'(this option is
configured in the glance-api.conf)  and querying for public images,
Glance will return all the public images together with the private
ones

While in ceilometer/image/glance.py#_Base.iter_images method,
ceilometer get the image list by querying public and private images
respectively and then chain the result lists together. This causes
the duplication of image in the image list.

This fix changes the code in ImagePollster.get_counters method to
filter out the duplicate images based on their image id.

You can resize an instance when it's in the ACTIVE or STOPPED state but
the code currently always finishes the resize (either confirmed or
rejected) by putting the instance into ACTIVE state. This change
saves the original vm_state and uses it to restore the state on the
instance after the resize is confirmed or rejected.

With this change, the resize flow will never automatically power on an
instance that is originally shutoff. The user, however, can manually
power on the resized instance to test it before confirming or rejecting
the resize. If the user powered on the instance and confirmed the
resize, then this change will leave the instance active. If the user
powered on the instance and then rejected the resize, this change will
stop the instance when it finishes the revert operation.

Part of fixing bug #1176817

We want to have the priority order of config file value vs CLI argument
to be determined by where on the command line the --config-file argument
appears.

e.g.

  --config-file nova.conf --log-file nova.log

would mean that a log_file value in nova.conf would be ignored, whereas

  --log-file nova.log --config-file nova.conf

would mean the value in the config file takes priority.

As a first step towards that, we move to parsing config files in an
argparse callback while processing the CLI args rather than parsing all
the config files together after CLI args processing. This allows us to
know whether a config file was loaded before or after a given CLI
argument.

Even this introduces a change in semantics - previously, the files in
the directory passed to --config-dir were parsed after any of the files
passed to --config-file. With this change, we now have --config-dir
processed according to where it appears on the command line e.g.

  --config-file foo.conf --config-dir blaa.d --config-file bar.conf

means that the files in blaa.d take precedence over foo.conf, but
bar.conf takes precedence over blaa.d. This is obviously the proper
semantics and we were never happy with the current semantics, so this is
all good.

Implements a new mechanism for handling revocation lists so that
proper caching can be done independantly of the token driver. There
are three provided revocation-list drivers: memcache, sql, and kvs.

SQL revocation-list driver is a simple passthrough driver than
mimics the previous behavior, relying on the SQL DB to provide all
of the relevant information.

KVS revocation-list driver works in a similar mechanism to the KVS
Token driver and will result in unreliable results when running
Keystone under HTTPD/gunicorn/etc because the DictKvs() object is
instantiated per driver-object and is not shared.  It should be
sufficient for caching the SQL revocation-list when running under
eventlet (or when running the kvs token driver).

Memcache revocation-list driver is the recommended driver to use as
it will handle the most scenarios.  The memcache driver will also
handle scenarios where the revoked-token list exceeds the maximum
page size of the memcache server with the smallest max_item_size.
This means that the memcache driver has to do some minimal
construction of the revocation-list from 1 or more pages.  The
majority of the cases will be loading in 2 pages to report the
revocation-list, the index page, and the actual JSON page.  In the
rare case that there is a massive revocation-list.  Memcache driver
will only reload from memcache if the index page differs from it's
internal cache.  New UUIDs are used for each page to ensure that
the internal cache is not stale if the revocation-list is rebuilt.

New Options added
    * (memcache) maximum_revocation_list_pages:
            The maximum number of pages that can be consumed for
            the revocation-list.  This is to set a hard-limit on
            the memory-footprint allowed to be consumed by the
            revocation-list itself.  It is extremely unlikely
            that the revocation-list will ever overflow to a
            2nd or 3rd page.
            Default: 10

    * (token) revoked_token_driver:
            string of the new revoked token driver (similar to
            how the token driver works).
            Default:
                keystone.token.revocation.backends.kvs.Revocation

Currently, oslo.config gives priority to parameters configured in the
configuration files. This behavior has caused some confusion to final
users and doesn't respect the ""natural"" way unix CLI apps work. This has
also caused some issues in other apps that expect the opposite to
happen.

After some discussion in the m-l [0], it looks like inverting this behavior
makes sense and projects would benefit from it.

This patch does exactly that. It looks for the required config first in
the CLI arguments and then in the configuration files. In this patch,
the override tests methods were duplicated in order to test 2 things:

1) The second config file should override the first one
2) CLI arguments should override config's ones.

If a resize is attempted on an instance that was started from an image
that has since been deleted, a resize will fail. This change makes error
reporting a bit cleaner.

This change is needed since in order to actually properly support
resize/migrate when the image is deleted - it is necessary for nova to keep
a copy of the image metadata and re-use it in case of migration/resize.

Setting it to ACTIVE to early will allow new resize or whatever
operations to start before the current confirm has finished which
might result in all sorts of conflicts.

Resolves bug 1161529 where an intermittent failure in a tempest test
happens because a confirm operation conflicts with a later resize
carried out on the same instance. As the new resize starts to move
around instance disks, the still not finished confirm operation might
fail at recalculating total disk usage due to a missing disk.

Other possible conflicts might be due to system_metadata and/or quota
not being up-to-date at the moment the instance becomes ACTIVE.

RFC 2616 Sec 4.4 Message Length describes how the content-length and
transfer-encoding headers interact. Basically, if chunked transfer
encoding is used, the content-length header value is ignored and if
the content-length header is present, and the request is not using
chunked transfer-encoding, then the content-length must match the body
length.

The only Transfer-Coding value we support in the Transfer-Encoding
header (to date) is ""chunked"". RFC 2616 Sec 14.41 specifies that if
""multiple encodings have been applied to an entity, the
transfer-codings MUST be listed in the order in which they were
applied."" Since we only supported ""chunked"". If the Transfer-Encoding
header value has multiple transfer-codings, we return a 501 (Not
Implemented) (see RFC 2616 Sec 3.6) without checking if chunked is the
last one specified. Finally, if transfer-encoding is anything but
""chunked"", we return a 400 (Bad Request) to the client.

This patch adds a new method, message_length, to the swob request
object which will apply an algorithm based on RFC 2616 Sec 4.4
leveraging the existing content_length property.

In addition to these changes, the proxy server will now notice when
the message length specified by the content-length header is greater
than the configured object maximum size and fail the request with a

The SolidFire device inherits all settings (including QoS) from
the parent on a clone.  This meant that although we were expecting
QoS to be updated when a clone was issued with a different Volume
Type than the parent volume it was never acted upon.

This change fixes that bug by simply adding the *new* qos settings
to the ModifyVolume call after cloning.

The original merged patch did not include test coverage for the changes
made to the db api. This change fix the error so that the original
behavior of the 'deleted' filter is restored while also adding full
test coverage for the modifications to the db api that has already

Finally, the support method create_instances_with_args() used by the

when called, it just creates a single instance.

Before the compute api called the scheduler to perform
live migrate. This change makes the compute api call the
conductor, which in turn calls the scheduler.

For those not using the conductor service,
this does not add any extra rpc calls.

This change in control flow means we can look to move
live-migrate more related rpc calls into the conductor
from both schduler driver and compute manager.

If, when using a Ceph as a backend for Cinder and Glance, you
create a volume from a Glance image, the request is actioned
in one of two ways; (1) if Glance does not supply sufficient

A warning message appears in Cinder logs which state that
inheritance-based rules are deprecated and use default
Brain instead of HttpBrain. It looks like HttpBrain class
doesnt have any difference from Brain class, so changing
all the instances of HttpBrain to Brain shouldn't affect
anything and removes this warning from logs.

Digging further, I found out that the policy engine has
gone through a major rework in Oslo and Nova, and I think
at some point of time in future, we will also be moving
to use the latest policy engine code. In that way of
thinking, I guess this fix is acceptable for now.
Reference: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/14122

Changed the brain from HttpBrain -> Brain, which makes the
warnings in the log disapper. A more comprehensive work will be
to pull the latest policy change code from Oslo.

Blueprint l3-ext-gw-modes

This patch introduces an API extension for enabling or disabling
source/destination NAT on the router gateway interface, and implements
support for this extension in the l3 agent, which has also been
refactored in order to ensure SNAT rules are applied (or removed)
in a single place in the process_router routine.
The patch therefore enables the extension on all plugins which
leverage this agent.
In this patch the validate_boolean function is re-introduced, as it
used for validating a field of the external_gateway_info dict.
The resource extension process is also slightly changed so that an
API extension can specify which extension should be processed before
its attributes can be processed. This is needed to ensure the
proper validator for external_gateway_info is installed.

There's 2 cases where this is true:

Because the flavor function show() will get B by id, when running

stored in assorted config files. With this patch only non-admin user
credentials are needed. The revocation_list and validate_token commands

Rule used:

more recent versions of boto, there is no option to use older AWS
signature methods. Only version 4 is supported. However, keystoneclient,
which keystone uses for validating signatures, only supports this in
trunk. Until that is released, any boto version after 2.5.2 will cause
heat-cfntools to be unable to authenticate with Heat.

By installing heat-cfntools in a virtualenv, we isolate it from the rest
of the system. This way as the boto version advances, we stay with the
one that works with heat-cfntools according to its own requirements.

Fixes bug #1183732

If the directory exists, but permissions are denied,

configure a handler on the 'ironic' logger means every log message gets

It seems that the pecan logging configuration stuff is redundant with
