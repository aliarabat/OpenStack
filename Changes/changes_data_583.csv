Initially the intent for adding this was to better test
any patches for roles together before they merge, but it
has had the unintended side-effect of causing patches to
take much longer to merge (because they all get lined up

a lot more infra resources are used (because a patch

* Deletion of delayed calls is incorrect. A list of delayed calls
  gets deleted within one DB transaction and if at least one object
  is not deleted because of a DBDeadlock exception (on MySQL) then
  the entire transaction fails and, what's more important, the
  exception is swallowed by the try-finally block without reraising
  it so that it could be handled by the ""retry_on_deadlock"" decorator.
  This patch fixes this problem by reraising the initial exception.
* Added ""retry_on_deadlock"" decorator to all methods methods that
  open DB transactions and where we have a risk of hitting a deadlock.

When sending notifications about an instance, it's possible the
notification payload will have attributes not already loaded on
the instance. In this case, a lazy-load will happen and if the
load method needs to lookup the instance (example: in the
_check_instance_exists_in_project method in the DB layer), the
InstanceNotFound exception will be raised and the notification
will fail to be sent.

This targets the instance context to the instance's cell when
calling the send notification method.

Closes-Bug: #1721670

 Conflicts:
	nova/conductor/manager.py
	nova/tests/unit/conductor/test_conductor.py

NOTE(melwitt): Conflict was due to the older version of target_cell
not yielding a new RequestContext, the absence of set_target_cell,
and an older version of the unit test in Ocata.

Due to missing puppet invocation with --detailed-exitcodes we ignored
a large amount of puppet errors during deploy. Swift storage fails
during the puppet_config step with the following error:

Debug: Executing: 'journalctl -n 50 --since '5 minutes ago' -u xinetd --no-pager'
Error: Systemd start for xinetd failed!

The problem is that by using the rsync::server tag we end up including
the xinetd class automatically which will try to start a service inside
a container. By nooping the xinetd class, we're able avoid systemctl
calls and have a successfuly deployment. The resulting swift_rsync
container seems to work correctly:

get_or_create_project() first calls a get (query of the database).
If that fails, then it calls create.  The issues is when
there are two threads and both fail the original get, then
each will call create.  One of those creates will fail, resulting
in the traceback.

One way to protect this critical region is to call create first,
then if that fails, call get.

In this case, get_or_create_project() is called for every
Barbican API operation.  The create action (which is slow), happens
once per project for the life of the cloud.  The get action happens
every other time.  For performance gains, I left call get first,
since that call succeeds almost always.

We rollback from a failed live migration in two cases:

1. The pre_live_migration on the destination host fails. The
   _do_live_migration method calls _rollback_live_migration
   explicitly to cleanup the dest host.

2. The live migration in the virt driver fails, and the virt driver
   calls back to _rollback_live_migration in the ComputeManager.

Either way, the instance is not on the destination host, so just like
how we remove volume connections and unplug vifs from the destination
host, we need to also remove allocations for the destination node in
Placement.

This change adds a test to show that we are not currently cleaning up
allocations on the destination node when we rollback from a live
migration failure.

Although oslo_log will catch the error, make scheduler.Timeout hashable so
that all exceptions will be printable.

Prior to 640abe0c12e63c207fcf67592838f112a29f5b43 we just used __cmp__(),
but that isn't used in Python 3. Defining __eq__(), which is required for
the total_ordering decorator, makes the class unhashable in Python 3.

Convergence allows us to start a stack update while a previous update (or
create) is still in progress. If a resource is found to be locked by a
previous graph traversal when the new traversal comes to update it, the
earlier traversal is responsible for retriggering the resource after it
completes.

This patch adds functional tests to confirm that this works when the
long-running resource update ends in success or failure (as opposed to
timing out or being cancelled).

In multi-region deployments using a shared Keystone, with each region
using its own Blazar and Nova services, Blazar could not be configured
to be part of a specific region. It would use the first endpoint found
in the service catalog. As a result, Blazar in RegionTwo would try to
manage Nova hosts and aggregates in RegionOne.

This patch adds a new configuration option called os_region_name in the
[DEFAULT] section. If set, Blazar looks up the right endpoints for its
region. The DevStack plugin is also updated to use the correct region
and Keystone host (which is otherwise set to the default of 127.0.0.1).

In a get_endpoint lookup, instead of returning the url in the catalog

The connection tests have a tendancy to patch the connection function on
the client module but not unpatch it. This means all the connection
tests are unstable depending on ordering.

Beyond that there is so much mocking going on that it is basically
impossible to know whether we are testing the client or the mock - in
some cases it's definetly just the mock.

This level of mocking makes it really difficult to modify any of the way
connection handling works because functions test for exactly what is
being passed to a function and not that the request they send is
correct. This makes things like supporting keystoneauth instead of
keysotneclient really difficult.

To standardize tests between clients a bit we bring in testtools and
request-mock to handle the mocking and response generation. In this
patch we convert only a couple of the test cases to show that it works
and then we can patch other test objects in later patches.

To make all devstack services work in a namespaced fashion we need for
them all to be able to individually add apache configuration that is
read as part of the same virtual host.

The way different services treat apache makes it difficult to share,
currently horizon simply creates and owns the port 80 virtual host,
keystone needs to add things to the port 80 host and create the 443
vhost to make SSL work.

This arrangement is not just a keystone/horizon problem and will apply
to all services.

Create a vhost snippet arrangement. A ""http"" site is added to apache
that loads all apache config snippets from ""http-enabled"". This
configuration will in future patches allow a similar ""ssl-enabled""
structure for SSL endpoints.

Now everything that is added to the http-enabled snippets exists in the
same vhost, yet each service can control its own apache config.

To handle fetching expired tokens with a service token we need to change
the AuthToken api to pass both the auth and service tokens together. An
obvious extension to passing both tokens to keystone individually is to
have keystone validate both tokens in a single request so we should be
able to support that in future.

We have to continue to support the old individual fetch_token API for
keystone's use and we will probably want to continue using it for
keystone versions that do not support passing both tokens together.

Services can define external_deploy_tasks, which are meant to be
executed on the undercloud node. They are step-based as the other
Ansible tasks we have, and they get executed during each deployment
step before the puppet and docker tasks.

These tasks can be used to perform complex actions from the
undercloud, such as executing nested installers like kubespray or
ceph-ansible. This should allow deploying overcloud with a single
Ansible playbook, and without creating Ansible->Mistral->Ansible loop.

Presently, ""openstack overcloud config download"" only supports the
OS::HeatSoftwareDeploymentGroup (plural) resources from
deploy-steps.yaml.

This patch adds support to the command to also pull the deployment
resources for each individual server from the OS::Heat::Value resources
called ""TripleODeployment"", as well as other SoftwareDeploymentGroup
resources not from deploy-steps.j2. See the Depends-On
tripleo-heat-templates patch for how these resources are mapped.

These deployments are applied by additional plays in the generated
playbooks. Instead of having to reimplement each deployment in a native
group:ansible, the ansible tasks just trigger the deployments by calling
55-heat-config remotely with the rendered json deployment data for
whatever deployment is being applied.

This method saves us from having to migrate all these resources to
native ansible (and requring all end users to do so).

Also included is a helper script called tripleo-config-download to run
the config download outside of Mistral.

The current implementation of disk usage computation was done
with exactly one partition in mind.  The computed result does
not make much sense in an environment of various level of block
devices with possible many mount points.

Currently the usage is computed at the wrong place: after the
computation some packages are installed like grub and all the
dependencies.

This patch adds a dib-disk-usage tool which scan and computes
the image just before the umount - also based on the file
systems that are created in the image.

Currently it only logs the information.  Later patches can pick
up the results and automatically adapt partition or LVM sizes.

The scan and computation takes less than 0.2 sec for a typical
minimal image.

ToDo:
* More / better comments in python tool
* test cases

This changes the a-r-r with the proper version, and fixes
the repo path for role upgrades:

The role will, during test-upgrade-pre, have its current branch
checked out, and will deploy the current branch infrastructure,
including the generation of the constraints.

Then, the installation of previous branch of the role will use
the constraints for its previous version, but will have no
constraints for it, and fail.

We need to generate the constraints for the previous version too.
This should do it.

This patch also implements an initial set of jobs intended to
match the current job execution method. It does not intend to
improve how the jobs are executed - only to replicate what is
currently in openstack-infra/openstack-zuul-jobs and provide
the platform to iterate on.

Reasoning:
- Setting custom properties on glance images allows us to select the
type of disk bus e.g. VIRTIO/IDE/SCSI.
Although SATA disk bus works perfectly for qemu/kvm, it is not allowed
due to a check in virt/libvirt/blockinfo.py : is_disk_bus_valid_for_virt
- some Linux (custom) images require use of SATA bus rather than any
other that seems to be allowed.

Before the identity API documentation lived in-tree, it lived in the
openstack/keystone-specs project. Before that it lived in it's own
identity-api repository. A long time ago we merged a patch [0] to that
project to deprecate the project and domain APIs in the federation
path. That documentation has since been copied and migrated to the
keystone-specs repository and now keystone itself.

Even though we've deprecated those API in the documentation, we never
formally deprecated them in code using ``versionutils``. This commit
does that. Now a message will be logged anytime that API is used
instead of GET /auth/domains or GET /auth/projects. This makes the
implementation of keystone consistent with documentation we merged
ages ago.

Zuul is able to more effectively clone the roles used in
role tests more reliably that using a standard git clone
because it has a cache implementation to do exactly that.

This implements the commonly used role repositories as
required-projects for the tests so that our playbook to
get the ansible-role-requirements deoesn't have to do
the cloning, it'll just do the right symlinking. It will
still fetch any missing repositories, so this list does
not have to be a *full* list - just enough to help reduce
the current failures due to git cloning problems.

Initially the intent for adding this was to better test
any patches for roles together before they merge, but it
has had the unintended side-effect of causing patches to
take much longer to merge (because they all get lined up
in a single queue, rather than independent queues) and
a lot more infra resources are used (because a patch
that fails at the top of the queue will result in all
subsequent patches restarting all their tests).

As discussed in the channel, we'd prefer to revert back
to the previous independent queue method of testing. It
has served us well.

By default the includes are static, which means that all the tasks in
the include get the when applied rather than the include itself. This
leads to all tasks getting evaluated and needing to make sure variables
are defined, even though we are skipping all the tasks.

Instead, we make these includes dynamic, so that the skip happens at
the include, and ansible never evaluates any of the tasks if the
include is skipped.

One of the outcomes of the Pike retrospective to clarification
of the purpose of backlog. It was also mentioned that it would be
useful to have an `ideas` directory that allow people to propose
ideas that need to be freshed out and discussed. The backlog somewhat
filled this purpose but is going to be more specific in the future.

This commit clears up the direction of each location and what purpose
they fill.

With the current change in allowing the unbound fip
to be associated with the snat node, we are seeing
that all floating IPs that are associated with an
unbound port are created at the snat node.
This is also applicable for floating IPs that are
created just before associating the port to a VM.
We have seen such scenarios in the test cases.

This is the right behavior as per design. But when
the port is bound to a host, the floating IP should
be migrated to the respective host.

This patch fixes the issue by sending notification to
the respective node, when the port is bound and also
clear the fip from the snat node.

The [keystone_authtoken]/auth_uri middleware parameter has been causing
extreme confusion amongst operators and developers ever since the
keystonemiddleware started accepting keystoneauth plugin parameters
including auth_url. The two parameters look identical and yet have
completely different meanings and are both required. This patch
deprecates auth_uri and renames it to www_authenticate_uri, which more
accurately describes the WWW-Authenticate header it is configuring and
is dissimilar to any other keystone_authtoken middleware parameter. This
also renames the internal variable names for consistency with the config
option.

Zuul is able to more effectively clone the roles used in
role tests more reliably that using a standard git clone
because it has a cache implementation to do exactly that.

This implements the commonly used role repositories as
required-projects for the tests so that our playbook to
get the ansible-role-requirements deoesn't have to do
the cloning, it'll just do the right symlinking. It will
still fetch any missing repositories, so this list does
not have to be a *full* list - just enough to help reduce
the current failures due to git cloning problems.

The mission of OpenStack-Helm[1] is to provide a collection of Helm charts that
simply, resiliently, and flexibly deploy OpenStack and related services
on Kubernetes.  It allows the Helm client to be used directly to deploy
OpenStack components, and as such is comarable to OpenStack-Ansible
(providing playbooks for Ansible) or Puppet OpenStack (providing modules
for Puppet).  The project leverages native Kubernetes constructs and allows
OpenStack projects to be installed in combinations and configurations per
unique operator use cases.

OpenStack-Helm has a goal to facilitate pushbutton automated deployments, and
rolling upgrades with no impact to tenant workloads.  There is a one-to-one
correspondence between OpenStack projects and Helm charts, and charts are fully
independent of one another.  This allows for use cases from traditional
OpenStack clouds, to deployment of standalone components, and combinations
in between.

The project provides reasonable, usable configuration by default, and allows
for deployment-time overrides of individual values or a chart's entire values
config.  Dependent service endpoints (e.g. the Keystone API) default to
Kubernetes cluster-internal DNS names, but can be overridden to point at
external instances.  Multiple, alternate SDN and SDS solutions will be
integrated, and can be configured at deploy-time.  The choice of container
images is configurable as well, and can be mixed and matched on a
chart-by-chart basis per operator needs.  The project aims to be
production-grade out-of-box, including configuration for highly available
services, resilient storage for the control plane (e.g. Ceph), and security
features such as cluster-internal TLS.

OpenStack-Helm will follow the OpenStack independent release model[2], and will
ensure Helm charts integrate with an OpenStack release once it is released.
The team plans to change to cycle-trailing releases when ready, but will
need to close the gap between Newton (current-state) and master first.  In the
meantime, it will model the cycle-trailing branch strategy as it catches up.
The team is interested in feedback on this plan and advice from the TC.

A number of OpenStack deployment projects pave the way for OpenStack-Helm,
including OpenStack Ansible[3], Kolla-Kubernetes[4], OpenStack-Chef[5],
and Puppet OpenStack [6].  OpenStack-Helm occupies a unique space in its
exclusive use of Kubernetes-native constructs during the deployment process,
including Helm packaging and gotpl templating.  This tradeoff enables it to be
as lightweight and simple as possible, at the expense of operator choice of
deployment toolsets.  The project team is eager to work with other OpenStack
deployment projects to solve common needs and share learnings.

The OpenStack-Helm project and the team follow the Four Opens:

* Open Source: The project source code[7], specifications[8] and
documentation[9] are open source and are developed in the community under the
Apache 2.0 license.

* Open Design: Design decisions are discussed and formalized via
specifications, as well as openly discussed in the IRC chat room[10] and the
team meetings[11].  The team had informal meetings at the Atlanta and
Denver PTGs, as well as a presentation[12], hands-on workshop, and a related
cross-project Forum at the Boston Summit.  More of each are planned for Sydney.

* Open Development: All OpenStack-Helm code is reviewed and hosted in
OpenStack Infra[7]. blueprints and bugs are tracked by Launchpad[13].
Quality gates are run to ensure OpenStack deploys and runs with every
patch set, and integration of standard Rally and Tempest tests is underway.

* Open Community:  The project team and core reviewer team[14] represent
multiple employers, and are eager to groom new team members.  Project
discussions and Q&A are frequently held in the public IRC chat room, and
all are welcome.

Proposing adding [H210] hacking check in tox.ini to require ‘autospec’,
‘spec’, or ‘spec_set’ in mock.patch/mock.patch.object calls.

This patch adds missing 'autospec' to unit tests in /tests/unit/dhcp/.

By using autospec=True, assert errors can be caught. [H210] requires that some
value for autospec, spec, or spec_set is defined. It could be autospec=False.

More patches to follow to cover all the unit tests to enable [H210] in
tox.ini.

If IPv6 are used when installing the undercloud, they need to be
wrapped in square brackets. So port numbers can be distinguised
from IP addresses.

This patch wrapps IP addresses in the following places
o DB connection strings
o Swift ring generation
o Rabbit connection strings
o OS_AUTH_URL in stackrc

command to pass, need to dig deeper to see what else needs to be covered.
