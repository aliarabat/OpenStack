Switched implementation of anti affinity to server groups for both
direct and heat engine.

Direct engine change is backward compatible. Sahara will detect if
old logic is used and will use the same logic for cluster scaling.

Note, behavior of anti-affinity changed. Now Sahara will create one
server group for cluster and will assign all affected instances to it.
So, if anti-affinity enabled for datanode (`dn`) and tasktracker (`tt`)
Sahara will not assign node with `dn` and node with `tt` to the same
compute.

Also note, that server group support will be added to heat only in
juno-3. So, environment with up-to-date heat is required.

This change introduces pool-aware scheduler to address the need for
supporting multiple pools from one storage controller.

Terminology
-----------
Pool - A logical concept to describe a set of storage resource that
can be used to serve core Cinder requests, e.g. volumes/snapshots.
This notion is almost identical to Cinder Volume Backend, for it
has simliar attributes (capacity, capability).  The main difference
is Pool couldn't exist on its own, it must reside in a Volume
Backend.  One Volume Backend can have mulitple Pools but Pools
don't have sub-Pools (meaning even they have, sub-Pools don't get
to exposed to Cinder, yet).  Pool has a unique name in backend
namespace, which means Volume Backend can't have two pools using
same name.
Legacy Volume - Volumes that were created prior pools are introduced.
There are several corner cases where legacy volumes could cause
issues, especially for those drivers used to do pools internally
(e.g. 3Par, NetApp).  Please refer to 'Limitation/Known Issues' for
details.

Design
------
The workflow in this change is simple:
 1) Volume Backends reports how many pools and what those pools
 look like and are capable of to scheduler;
 2) When request comes in, scheduler picks a pool that fits the need
 most to serve the request, it passes the request to the backend
 where the target pool resides in;
 3) Volume driver gets the message and let the target pool to serve
 the request as scheduler instructed.

To support placing resources (volume/snapshot) onto a pool, these
pieces in Cinder currently are missing:
1. Volume Backends reporting capacity/capabilities at pool level;
2. Scheduler filtering/weighing based on pool capacity/capability
and placing volumes/snapshots to a pool of certain backend;
3. Record which pool a resource is located on a backend and passes
between scheduler and volume backend.

The missing piece 1 is solved by a) updating the format of
periodical volume stats message to adopt pool stats; b) altering
manager/driver to collect and report pool stats.  Below is an example
of the updated report message that contains 2 pools:

    capability = {
        'volume_backend_name': 'Local iSCSI', #\
        'vendor_name': 'OpenStack',           #  backend level
        'driver_version': '1.0',              #  mandatory/fixed
        'storage_protocol': 'iSCSI',          #- stats&capabilities

        'active_volumes': 10,                 #\
        'IOPS_provisioned': 30000,            #  optional custom
        'fancy_capability_1': 'eat',          #  stats & capabilities
        'fancy_capability_2': 'drink',        #/

        'pools': [
            {'pool_name': '1st pool',         #\
             'total_capacity_gb': 500,        #  mandatory stats for
             'free_capacity_gb': 230,         #  pools
             'allocated_capacity_gb': 270,    # |
             'QoS_support': 'False',          # |
             'reserved_percentage': 0,        #/

             'dying_disks': 100,              #\
             'super_hero_1': 'spider-man',    #  optional custom
             'super_hero_2': 'flash',         #  stats & capabilities
             'super_hero_3': 'neoncat'        #/
             },
            {'pool_name': '2nd pool',
             'total_capacity_gb': 1024,
             'free_capacity_gb': 1024,
             'allocated_capacity_gb': 0,
             'QoS_support': 'False',
             'reserved_percentage': 0,

             'dying_disks': 200,
             'super_hero_1': 'superman',
             'super_hero_2': ' ',
             'super_hero_2': 'Hulk',
             }
        ]
    }

Notice that there are now two levels of mandatory/fixed stats &
capabilities that every volume driver should report.

The scheduler change is mostly done in scheduler/host_manager.py:
* HostState adds a list element to hold PoolState(s) (a HostState sub-
class).  Each PoolState can be treated like a HostState since it has
as much information as HostState and also share the same structure.
HostState.update_capabilities()/update_from_volume_capability() are
changed to handle both legacy and new report messages.
* HostManager.get_all_host_states() now returns a PoolState iterator
that includes all pools scheduler tracks.  To filters and weighers,
PoolState() and HostState() are identical, thus there is no need to
change filters and weighers since they are dealing with same kind of
information and exact same data strucuture as before.  What filter
and weigher deals with looks like this:
    # Before this change
      HostState() for Backend 1
         ...
      HostState() for Backend N
    # After this change
      PoolState() for Backend 1 Pool 1
         ...
      PoolState() for Backend 1 Pool N

        ...

      PoolState() for Backend N Pool 1
         ...
      PoolState() for Backend N Pool N

With this change, filter scheduler will pick a pool@host instead of a
host.

Now that we are able to report and decide at pool level, the 3rd
missing piece is easy to fix.  Just like how multi-backend
volume service is supported, we encoded pool name into 'host' field
of Volume table.  The 'host' field is now 'host@backend#pool'. Notice
that this change doesn't mean that cinder-volume service will have to
subscribe to multiple RPC channels.  There is no need to mess with
message queue subscription at all because we did a little trick when
determining RPC target in VolumeRPCAPI: correct host info like
'host@backend' is extracted from 'host@backend#pool' before sending
RPC messages.  Therefore, once scheduler decides which pool on a
backend shall serve a request, it updates 'host' field of the volume
record in DB to be like 'host@backend#pool', but it still sends RPC
message to 'host@backend' which cinder-volume is listening to.

Simliar action is done when creating backups for volumes.  host@backend
is extracted from volume['host'] so that correct backup service can be
picked.

Other changes are done in this patch:

* Change get_volume_stats() in ISCSIVolumeDriver/ISERDriver to include
pool stats, and change default total/free_capacity_gb from 'infinite'
to 0.
* Add logic in volume manager init_host() to detect legacy volumes and
try to update host info for them if driver is able to provide pool info.
* Add get_pool() driver API to return the pool name of given volume,
this help volume manager to handle legacy volumes, especially for those
backends already support pooling internally (e.g. 3Par, NetApp).
* Implement get_pool() for LVM driver to return volume backend name as
pool name.
* Add extract_host() helper function in cinder/volume/utils.py to help
handle cases where there is needs to extract 'host', 'backend' or
'pool' information from volume['host'].
* Add append_host() helper function in cinder/volume/utils.py to help
concatenate host and pool string into one for volume['host'] field.

Limitation/Known Issues
-----------------------
* The term 'host' in Cinder used to refer to 'backend', and it was
consistent from the view of end users/admins to Cinder internals.
Now that pool is exposed to Cinder scheduler, scheduler starts treating
different pools on same backend as different hosts.  Therefore, we have
to expose pool to admin at least, because migrating volume now has to
include pool in 'host' parameter in order to work.  As for end users,
the whole 'host' of volume equals storage backend idea works well for
them, so they can decide the policy of migration when retyping volumes,
or choose to create new volume on same or different host as/from
existing volumes.  Now it's *not* easy to hide pool from end user and
make retype or affinity filter work like before.  This change has a
speical code path for legacy volumes, to allow (potential) migration
between pools even migration_policy is set to 'never'.  But not every
driver has magic to move volumes to one pool to another at minimum
cost.  The inconsistency behavior between drivers (same command may
take totally different time to finish), which could be very confusing.

* Drivers want to support pools need to update, but they should work
just like they used to without any change except:
 - creating volume using same/different host hints with legacy volumes
 may NOT work as expected, because 'hostA' is considered different
 from 'hostA#pool0' and 'hostA#pool1'.  But legacy volume on 'hostA'
 might actually resides in pool0, only the driver has this knowledge.
 - retyping legacy volume issue as mentioned above.

Ultimate solution for all these corner cases is to update Cinder DB
to add 'pool' info for legacy volumes.  The problem is only the driver
knows such info, that is why we add a new driver API get_pool() to
so that volume manager is able to learn pool info from driver and
update host field of legacy volumes in DB.

User-Visible Change
-------------------
DocImpact
For managing and migrating volumes, now user needs to provide pool
information as part of host string. For example:
  cinder manage --source-name X --name newX host@backend#POOL
  cinder migrate UUID host@backend#POOL

The check logs script was not properly detecting grenade and would fail
grenade jobs if the logs were not clean. We don't want to do this
because the upgrade process is not log clean yet. Correct this by
setting grenade flag to true only if the DEVSTACK_GATE_GRENADE variable

IBM Storwize driver can be enabled with QoS support by setting the parameter
I/O throttling rate, which caps the amount of I/O.

This patch add the QoS configuration to the methods of create_volume,
create_volume_from_snapshot, create_cloned_volume and retype.

The QoS for IBM Storwize storage can be configured in 3 ways:
* Add the key ""qos:IOThrottling"" into a QoS spec and associate this QoS
spec with a volume type.
* Add the key ""qos:IOThrottling"" into the extra spec of a volume type.
* Add a metadata with the key ""qos:IOThrottling"".

The ceilometer compute agent requires that the 'nova' group
be present. Since nova is no longer handling user and group
installation, some dependency must be established to make sure
basic nova packages are present.

The dependency chain now adds Package['nova-common'] as a
requirement for Packate['ceilometer-common'], which will
ensure that Nova and it's user/group will be created before
the nova group is added to the ceilometer user.

This change moves the logic for skipping instances with pending tasks
during a _sync_power_states call outside of the lock as it can cause
other periodic tasks to get backed up behind it.

It seems safe not to lock around the task_state check for a skip
because the instance object was read before the locking and isn't

When a ProcessExecutionError is thrown by processutils.ssh_execute(),
the exception may contain information such as password. Upstream
applications that just log the message (as several appear to do) could
inadvertently expose these passwords to a user with read access to the
log files. It is therefore considered prudent to invoke
strutils.mask_password() on the command, stdout and stderr in the
exception. A test case has been added to ensure that all three are
properly masked.

An earlier commit (I173dfb865e84eb7dee54a22c76db1e4f125a0a8a) failed
to address ssh_execute(). This change set addresses ssh_execute.

This patch adds configuration options for ssh_hosts_key_file and
strict_ssh_host_key_policy.  You can set strict_ssh_host_key_policy
to 'True' or 'False'.  If set to false the first connection of a host
will cause it to be added to the known_hosts file.  Subsequent connections
will be enforced against the existing key.  Changes in the key are assumed
to be a Man-in-the-Middle attack so the connection is rejected.

If strict_ssh_host_key_policy is 'True' the key for the host that is
being connected to must be in the hosts_key_file.  No first connection
assumptions are made.

strict_ssh_host_key_policy is set to 'False' to keep functionality similar
to the existing functionality.

With this patch, a default of $state_path/ssh_known_hosts is used for the
known_hosts file.  Unlike the previous approach, this now requires the
user to have a known_hosts file that is writable, somewhere.  The option
is configurable if they don't want to use $state_path/ssh_known_hosts

DocImpact:  Need to document the new strict_ssh_host_key_policy as well
as the ssh_hosts_key_file.  A note should be made for drivers that may
pass a hosts_key_file via kwargs when creating an ssh pool: their file
will be loaded along with the file configured via /etc/cinder.conf.
Also worth noting, for development environments, an ssh_hosts_key_file of
/dev/null and a strict_ssh_host_key_policy setting of 'False' may be used.
Using those setting will ignore these changes.

EC fragment archives need to go on the right primary nodes; that is,
fragment archive 0 needs to go on primary node 0, 1 on 1, and so
forth. Handoff nodes, however, are unordered.

This commit plumbs the index through to the proxy ObjectController's
PUT method as well as adds a (very simple) transform for replicated
data storage. Hopefully, this provides an easy integration point for
EC to use.

isolate the Nova venv (should we choose to do so).

This patch mostly removes the use of counters to track stats and
does the calculations on the fly. These calculations should still be
quite fast, since we are still using a per-claim counter (which
is easier to maintain than the per-queue counters).

Commit b6e1a28cd7c0df9ae6f2d86e18733f38bd5b5548 adds
the import of unittest.util which is only in python
2.7, so this will fail if running Tempest on python
2.6, e.g. RHEL/CentOS 6.5.

There is already some unit test code in Tempest using
unittest2 so this isn't novel and will presumably be
removed in Kilo when the community drops py26 support.

This commit introduces a new deploy driver which uses iLO virtual
media to boot up proliant baremetal nodes, and uses agent to deploy
the baremetal nodes.

This patch also changes agent pxe config template slightly, so that
the names of agent ramdisk parameters generated in code and those
expected by agent ramdisk are same.

These are the minimal changes necessary to integrate the vmwareapi
driver with the oslo.vmware code. Much of the change is mechanical
switching to call the library code, and removing obseleted code in the
driver where appropriate.

Effort was made to minimize the amount of actual driver code changes in
this round by keeping a small amount of shim code. Existing unit tests
were modified as appropriate. Additional patches will be introduced
shortly to include additional conversions and tests.

Summary of changes:

- use common/vmware/exceptions.py
- use oslo.vmware vim.py for the Vim implemenation
- use oslo.vmware api.py for api invocation/session
- updated existing unit tests
- nova retains its own version of get_{soap/wsdl}_url which using conf
  settings for default and overrides.

Creating an instance on a Hyper-V / Windows Server 2008 R2
compute node fails due to a WMI exception. This happens
while creating creating and configuring the resources to be
added to the VM.

The resources already have set default values for
certain properties, while other properties have NULL.
Trying to set a new value over the NULL causes the exception.

This issue can be avoided by bypassing the WMI object's
__setattr__ and instead set the attributes via WMI object's
wmi_property method.

Add a new 'version_cap' setting in the 'libvirt' group of the
nova.conf file. This allows the cloud admin to artifically
restrict what libvirt features are used by nova. This can be
useful in a number of scenarios

 - Admin wishes to pull in newer libvirt version to address
   a bug, but does not want any change in behaviour of nova
   by having it use different libvirt features

 - Admin is running a cloud with a variety of base OS versions
   and wants Nova to use the same libvirt feature set across
   all nodes despite some nodes having newer libvirt.

 - Admin wants to ensure their cloud deployment is only using
   libvirt features that were tested by the OpenStack CI
   system.

The default value of the config parameter is None, so no
attempt is made to cap the version out of the box.

DocImpact: libvirt.version_cap config parameter added

This change fixes a bug in Nova's
GET /v2/{tenant_id}/os-networks

The doc
http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-compute/2/content/GET_os-networks-v2_ListNetworks__v2__tenant_id__os-networks_ext-os-networks.html
says that ""Lists networks that are available to the tenant"".

When invoked by a non-admin user it was returning only networks
assigned to the user's tenant.  But in flat and flat DHCP nova
networking, networks CAN NOT be assigned to tenants --- thus a
non-admin user would get zero networks from this operation.

The fix was to make this operation conditionally use an option already
present in the lower-level code to ""allow_none"" when fetching the list
of networks, meaning to include networks whose project_id field in the
DB held ""none"" (meaning the network is not assigned to a tenant).  The
condition under which this is done is that the Nova configuration
option named network_manager contains the string
""'nova.network.manager.Flat"" --- which is true for flat and flat DHCP
nova networking and false for VLAN nova networking.

a dict for the list of services. The tests would then pull out
the first item in the list of keys of the dict. When the python
hash seed is set to a random value the list of keys has no
predictable ordering, causing the test suite to break. Changing
the data structure to use a list of lists instead of a dict

After sending SIGHUP signal to glance-service parent process,
it will call SIGHUP callback handler and then throws OSError.
The OSError is thrown because os.wait system call was
interrupted due to SIGHUP callback handler. As a result of
this parent process closes the server socket.
All child processes also gets terminated without completing
existing api requests because the server socket is already
closed and the service doesn't restart.

Added service module, launcher and common service module with
its dependencies from oslo-incubator in glance service.

After modifying the implemenatation, glance-service is able to
restart on sending SIGHUP signal to parent process and also
completing existing api requests.

Made provision to pass default hub to eventlet.hubs.use_hub()
in oslo-incubator common service famework. Defined new configuration
parameter 'eventlet_hub' with default value as 'poll' in glance.cmd.api
and glance.cmd.registry  and leveraged same to service framework of

This patch adds basic support for glusterfs native protocol driver
that uses cert based access type.

A Manila share is a GlusterFS volume. Unlike the generic driver, this
does not use service VM approach. Instances directly talk with the
GlusterFS backend storage pool. Instance use the 'glusterfs' protocol
to mount the GlusterFS share. Access to the share is allowed via
SSL Certificates. Only the share which has the SSL trust established
with the GlusterFS backend can mount and hence use the share.

Establishing the SSL trust between the instance and backend is done
out of band of Manila.

Depending on how Solum is installed, the contrib directory
may not exist in the directory three levels above handlers/shell.

This change takes advantage of the Handler's proj_dir property,
allowing it to supercede the relative path if it's set.
The name proj_dir reflects the directory that contains the contrib directory,
among others, because that is where the original project codebase lies.

Adds a simple example of using the native WaitCondition and
WaitConditionHandle resources, which work in a similar way to
the CFN compatible ones, but with more relaxed validation of
data, and some additional helper attributes so you don't need
to remember how to write the curl call in the template unless
you need something unusual in the request.

Added stack outputs that show and explain the webhooks and a
ceilometer query that selects samples about VMs in the stack.

issues this patch fixes are:

* Put the ReturnValue constants in a common place so it can be used by
  the power and management interfaces code.
* Move the filter object creation to inside the client. This also adds
  a new exception DracInvalidFilterDialect which is raised if when an
  invalid filter dialect is specified.
* Fix the docstring of the find_xml method to reflect the values returned
  in case an element is not found.
* Move the helper test function _mock_wsman_root() to a common place
  and update tests to use it.

This patch uses Redis where possible to automatically expire
claim and message data. Where it is not possible, manual
GC functions have been added in order to iterate through the
remaining data and clean it up.

Note that this patch does not include an implementation for
a command script that will call the Redis drivers' GC
method. That will be done in a followup patch.

Also, the GC functions in this patch do not decrement the
stats counters, since those are actually removed in the next
patch.

1. BaseTestCase.get_client_manager now generates different

   are also optional keyword arguments to control the type of
   manager to be instantiate as well as an alternate manager type
   in case tenant isolation is disabled.

Stopping of new containers during the upgrade
leads to a lot of errors and raise conditions.
At the same time containers should be run under
supervisor because we need to store logs.

Rewrote upgrade flow:

* stop old containers
* upload the images
* generate supervisor config with autostart False,
  it allows to prevent supervisor to run containers
* run containers in method `create_and_start_new_containers`
  one by one in right order
* regenerate configs for supervisor with autostart
  True, to start all of the containers after supervisor
  restart
* verify containers

How it helps:

* there was race condition when we were running
  services via supervisor and iptables cleaning
  at the same time, supervisor not always was
  able to start all containers, as result we
  could get nat rules with the same port but
  different ip addresses
* containers stopping could interrupt non-atomic
  actions, like db migration in keystone container
* since we run container one by one, we will not
  be able to get problem with ip duplication,
  during the upgrade

When a ProcessExecutionError is thrown by processutils.ssh_execute(),
the exception may contain information such as password. Upstream
applications that just log the message (as several appear to do) could
inadvertently expose these passwords to a user with read access to the
log files. It is therefore considered prudent to invoke
strutils.mask_password() on the command, stdout and stderr in the
exception. A test case has been added to ensure that all three are
properly masked.

An earlier commit (e8199714) failed to address ssh_execute(). This
change set addresses ssh_execute.

pexpect attempts to stop the temp mysqld process which fails due to
a difference in privilege level (since the process was run with sudo).

Currently, the Cisco VPN drivers use two routers for the proof of concept
solution. A Neutron router provides access to the public and private
subnets, and a Cisco CSR (out-of-band) provides the VPN tunneling.

The end goal is to integrate the Cisco VPN drivers with the Cisco L3
routing plugin being developed (as a separate blueprint), allowing an
in-band CSR to be used as a Neutron router for VPN functionality.

This commit provides an incremental approach to that goal, by modifying
the Cisco VPN drivers to be able to dynamically obtain CSR info from
an INI file, instead of statically reading the INI file at start-up.

A CSR VM can be created out-of-band (or in-band using Nova) and the INI
file can be updated with the router info. Then, the Cisco VPN driver
can use that information (dynamically) to create IPSec connections.

Once the Cisco L3 router plugin is available, the INI file will be
removed, and two calls to the plugin will be used to obtain the needed
router information, for an integrated solution.

The main advantages are:
    - Dynamically use the CSR for VPN.
    - Less manual intervention and setup.
    - Easy migration to final solution.
    - No dependency on the Cisco L3 router plugin implementation.

Note 1: The INI unit tests are moved from device driver to service
        driver and modified.

Note 2: I added a unit test for deleting IPSec site-to-site connection,
        which was missing (pass).

Note 3: For more details on the change, you can view this Google Doc:

This is just some exploration to see how much needs to change
to get simpler queries when using the new schema proposed
in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/111313/11

The primary insight here is that the scenario tests create
samples which are considered impossible in the ""real"" world.
Changing the tests (as done) allows more straightforward
queries of the resource and meter tables (and potentially
more, thus the WIP).

The mongo storage implementation works with _either_ these tests or
the unchanged tests because it only saves the most recent resource
representation anyway.

At the moment the only code-side change is get_meters of the sql-a
implementation. In that a subquery (present to duplicate the mongo
behavior) is removed and the sample table is joined. This leads to
a much simpler query plan with 3 tables instead of 5 or 6 tables,
duplicate tables or temporary tables involved. This ought to result
in much better reads when doing a meter-list, even when joining
the metadata tables.

Note that postgresql requires either many group by statements, or
a distinct(). mysql and sqlite do not.

NB: I have not yet performance tested these changes, only explored
the query plan. It is possible (but unlikely) that simple selects
using indexes will be slower than more complex queries, so we should
be sure to do real tests. The current query arrangement is one of
several options. In situations with more data one of those other
options may be better.

Next steps (if any):

* try with lots of data, explore other options
* explore event handling (other get_* methods already explored)

Generic driver uses separate module service_instance for handling of Nova VMs.
If service m-shr starts and there are existing scheduled shares for creation,
then concurrent issue appears between method 'do_setup', that is called once
on start of service and 'ensure_server', that uses stuff from do_setup.

Main error is in following:
- ""Returning exception 'GenericShareDriver' object has no attribute
  'service_instance_manager' to caller""

Changes:
- moved definition of attr 'service_instance_manager' to __init__ method.
- removed attrs '_helpers' and 'share_networks_servers' from
  ServiceInstanceManager as they are redundant.
- updated unittests according to changes.
- used direct import of 'constants' submodule for neutron api,
  to be able to access it on driver init step.
- replaced generic driver with common driver interface for inheritance
  by fake driver for unittests.

Short version: make use of the new distributed workload partitioning
utilities in Ceilometer to simplify the alarm evaluation
partitioning. Code is intentionally non-consolidated to enable
easy deletion of 'singleton' and 'partitioned' services in the Kilo
cycle.

Longer version:
The assignment of alarms to individual partitioned alarm evaluators
now follows the same pattern as the division of resources between
scaled-out central agents.

The evaluators each join a tooz group and emit a periodic heartbeat
to tooz. Tooz provides distributed group membership information.

Thus the set of evaluators share minimal knowledge, but this is
sufficient to guide a hash-based approach to determining whether
an individual alarm UUID falls under the responsibility of an
individual evaluator.

The current RPC-fanout-based presence reporting and the master/slave
division of responsibilities can be dropped in the next cycle.
Also the rebalancing logic when a certain threshold of alarm
deletion is crossed will no longer be required.

The DVR development added this device_owner to the middle of this
tuple during early development because it was thought to be needed.
Over the course of development, it was found to be unnecessary and
much of the code that read it from this value was removed or
obsoleted.  That job went unfinished and so this commit completes it.
This essentially restores the code to what it was before and fixes the
regression that was caused.

After sending SIGHUP signal to glance-service parent process,
it will call SIGHUP callback handler and then throws OSError.
The OSError is thrown because os.wait system call was
interrupted due to SIGHUP callback handler. As a result of
this parent process closes the server socket.
All child processes also gets terminated without completing
existing api requests because the server socket is already
closed and the service doesn't restart.

Added service module, launcher and common service module with
its dependencies from oslo-incubator in glance service.

After modifying the implemenatation, glance-service is able to
restart on sending SIGHUP signal to parent process and also
completing existing api requests.

Made provision to pass default hub to eventlet.hubs.use_hub()

This patch fix the coding issue where ""mutable"" objects like list, dict
are being used as default value of param.

Current functions with mutable object as default value can create issues
if they will be called in more random order.
For example - first call with non default value and then with default
value. In this case original default will be overridden by the first
function call (as mutable object keep their state among function calls).

This commit also add the hacking check for the same and its
corresponding test.

This patch ensures that removed ports will be cleaned up properly if exception

If there's an exception, the ports that were flagged for cleaning will
be retreated in the following iteration,
unlike previous exception handling, where only existing ports
were treated in the following iteration.

It does the same for the mlnx agent as was done for the ovs-agent in
I219c6bdf63b0b5e945b655677f9e28fa591f03cd.
Processing a port_update notification directly in the RPC
call may cause competition with the main RPC loop.
To prevent this problem, the actual process of ports updates is done
in the main RPC loop, whereas the RPC call merely adds the updated
port MAC address to a set of updated ports.
port_update notifications received within a single main loop iteration
will be coalesced and processed only once.

Helper methods for plugin and notification setup were previously
defined on neutron.tests.base.BaseTestCase.  The imports required to
support these helpers were preventing the api tests from consuming
tempest due to configuration conflicts that resulted between neutron
and tempest.  This change moves the helpers to a new module in
tests/unit so that BaseTestCase can be safely used across all types of
tests.

We can get this from the object attribute so no need to pass it in
explicitly.

We do not need to bump the version of the object as there is no code
calling it as of yet, so we do not have to support the broken method
interface until the next major version bump.
