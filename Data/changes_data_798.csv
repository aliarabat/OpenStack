As the following part of API-WG guidline[1],

  If a request contains a reference to a nonexistent resource in the
  body (not URI), the code should be 400 Bad Request. Do not use 404
  NotFound because :rfc:`7231#section-6.5.4` (section 6.5.4) mentions
  the origin server did not find a current representation for the
  target resource for 404 and representation for the target resource
  means a URI

Nova should return a BadRequest response(400) in this case, because
new_volume_id is specified in a request body. old_volume_id is not
necessary to be changed because the value is specified with URI.
So it is valid to return NotFound response if that is not existent.

This is something I expect has been very broken for a long time. We
have rows in tables such as instance_extra, instance_faults, etc that
pertain to a single instance, and thus have a foreign key on their
instance_uuid column that points to the instance. If any of those
records exist, an instance can not be archived out of the main
instances table.

The archive routine currently ""handles"" this by skipping over said
instances, and eventually iterating over all the tables to pull out
any records that point to that instance, thus freeing up the instance
itself for archival. The problem is, this only happens if those extra
records are actually marked as deleted themselves. If we fail during
a cleanup routine and leave some of them not marked as deleted, but
where the instance they reference *is* marked as deleted, we will
never archive them.

This patch adds another phase of the archival process for any table
that has an ""instance_uuid"" column, which attempts to archive records
that point to these deleted instances. With this, using a very large
real world sample database, I was able to archive my way down to
zero deleted, un-archivable instances (from north of 100k).

The current idempotency check is broken because Ansible
does not produce a log output without the environment
variable being exported.

This patch ensures that each playbook run produces an
individual log, and ensures that the idempotency check
uses the correct log output.

The following are also included:
- The script outputs the full CLI used to execute the test
  playbook. This is useful for debugging purposes.
- The parameters are re-ordered in alphabetical order to
  make them easier to find.
- The log collection now also collects the Ansible logs.
- Instead of repeating the rsync command in the log collection
  a variable is used, reducing the line length and making it
  easier to change/re-use.

We currently allow Magnum to scale down mesos cluster by removing nodes
from the cluster's ResourceGroup by updating the heat stack that created
the cluster. The problem with this approach is that Heat decides which
nodes to delete, and all containers on that node will also be deleted.

The smart cluster scale down feature has been implemented for k8s bays(
for k8s cluster, we'll ask Heat to delete nodes that have NO CONTAINERS
on them).

This patch proposes a similar implementation for a mesos cluster.

Makes the logic for overriding config options for the key_manager
more robust.

Before this patch, the override logic seemed to be called before the global
CONF object has been populated with values from the configuration file.
ConfKeyManager, the default for if no value had been specified, would be
used to override the value for api_class. Then when CONF was populated
with the actual values, the ConfKeyManager override value would still be
set.

This patch makes the logic a little bit more robust so that the value
is only overriden if explicitly passed into the function, not at the
global scope outside of the function.

Keystone's various Manager classes typically handle the sending of
a notification. In order to send the notification an `initiator` is
needed. All Manager CRUD methods typically ask for this as a kwarg
since it's not required in all cases.

Most of the controller layers pass the initiator value as a
positional argument. This commit makes it so the controller passes it
as a kwarg since that's how the Manager class method signature
describes it.

This change will use the same data model for image metadata as the
accompanying functionality in Glance, which will allow the end user
to sign images and verify these image signatures upon upload.

Allow specifying a service name and version to the session and a client
name and version to the adapter. The way this will work is that
libraries such as keystoneclient will pass client_name and
client_version when creating their adapter. Then when nova or another
service creates a session it will provide the service name and version.
The combination of these will be used to provide a meaningful user
agent.

Alarms for dimensions that contain spaces (like hostnames)
aren't displayed if we simply remove spaces from the dimension
values. URLs are already encoded and spaces get translated

If the remote target and the caller have different python
versions, then built-in exceptions raised by the remote target
will not be properly deserialized on the caller. Because of this,
oslo.messaging will simply raise a RemoteError, instead of any
expected exceptions the caller might expect.

This patch addresses this issue.

Since the library is itself in upper-constraints.txt file, we should
remove its entry from the constraints file before applying it, otherwise
pip will fail due to version conflict between what's in the current

There is a race condition triggered by the test where a VM and subports
associated to trunk linked to the VM are deleted in fast sequence. What
happens is that subport removal can no longer store metadata associated
to the trunk as the trunk is being removed.

Even though the race does not lead to errors, the trace may mislead the
operator in thinking there is something worth investigating when in reality
everything is fine.

To solve this issue, we should avoid raising RuntimeError for when the
parent port is not found, because that prevents us from handling this
race correctly.

As the following part of API-WG guidline[1],

  If a request contains a reference to a nonexistent resource in the
  body (not URI), the code should be 400 Bad Request. Do not use 404
  NotFound because :rfc:`7231#section-6.5.4` (section 6.5.4) mentions
  the origin server did not find a current representation for the
  target resource for 404 and representation for the target resource
  means a URI

Nova should return a BadRequest response(400) in this case, because
new_volume_id is specified in a request body. old_volume_id is not
necessary to be changed because the value is specified with URI.
So it is valid to return NotFound response if that is not existent.

This commit adds the ability for Octavia to make use of PKCS7
intermediate certificate bundles. These PKCS7 bundles may be in PEM or
DER format. This feature is being added since barbican specifies that
this is the preferred format for intermediate bundles in secret
containers.

This commit also re-arranges and/or strengthens several of our existing
tests of TLS / SNI functionality and in the process also fixes a bug
where encrypted private keys were not uploaded to amphorae in a format
that haproxy can readily parse. I have also added several sample or
dummy certificates which can be used for an up-coming scenario test
which exercises TLS-termination capabilities of Octavia.

Add a new script to build release notes including translation,
we will run this script as part of each release notes build.

The new script will build releasenotes and all translations for them.
It checks for available translations and only builds for these.

The translated releasenotes are published in-tree, so for
trove-dashboard this would publish:
/releasenotes/trove-dashboard # Original untranslated content
/releasenotes/trove-dashboard/ja/  # Japanese translation
/releasenotes/trove-dashboard/ko_KR/ # Korean translation

The index file gets automatically enhanced to include
links to the translated releasenotes.

A preview of the generated release notes are at:
http://users.suse.com/~aj/horizon-releasenotes/
http://users.suse.com/~aj/trove-dashboard-releasenotes/

Include the file directly in JJB so that it can be changed anytime.
For details, see:
http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/definition.html#module-jenkins_jobs.local_yaml

This needs a change for jenkins-projects-checks.py: The yaml is now an
extented yaml, use the JJB yaml loader to parse it.

For now, use a separate job gate-{name}-i18n-releasenotes-nv and add it
only to horizon and openstack-manuals so that we can evaluate that this
works as expected. A followup will add this for all jobs and the
publishing as well.

The SSH driver for Ironic have its days counted. As part of the commit
8758116f837caf0e3e13d9cd54c128bdbe7a7880 for Ironic such drivers were
already marked as unsupported and will be removed from tree in the Ocata
release.

This patch also removes the previous non-voting ipmitool jobs which are
now redundant.

The stable/{liberty, newton} jobs will continue to use the *_ssh
driver, at least for now.

When we see a directive we do not understand, skip it instead of
reporting an error. This avoids embedding system error messages in the
output at the expense of sometimes leaking rst directives.

the error this
addresses. http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-announce/2016-October/001748.html

The admonition labels from the Sphinx code base are translated, but we
don't initialize the translation machinery when we convert the release
notes to text because we only publish the original text version. The
labels default to capitalized versions, so just use title() to produce
something similar without going through the un-initialized locale code.

This fixes the traceback we saw when publishing the newton release
announcement for nova:

enable_rabbitmq_cluster is now a ""yes"" by default but you can set it
to ""no"" if you want to disable clustering under any circumstances.

The agreement made at OpenStack in Austin was that Kolla-Kubernetes
would concentrate on RabbitMQ and MariaDB without clustering but
with persistent storage and workload migration, then examine how to
do proper distributed functionality as the project progresses, so I
am just following what we'd already agreed upon.

First, it helps us deal with issues of version upgrades without
dealing with clustered version upgrades and the synchronization
thereof.

Second, it provides an alternative model for durability when used in
Kubernetes.  Understand that, if we disable RabbitMQ's clustering,
Kubernetes is still able to re-schedule the queue off of a failed node
in ways that Kolla-Ansible is not.  There are known issues with
RabbitMQ clustering, especially with auto-heal turned on.  For many
small-to-mid-sized clusters, it's going to provide for a better
operator experience to have the known potential for a 30 second blip
after RabbitMQ node failure than it is to have the known potential
for partition and data loss and/or manual operations after you've
turned off auto-heal.

Kolla-kubernetes has already turned off host networking for the
RabbitMQ pod; it's safe to set the interface address in the
Kubernetes context.

The question was asked why don't I just set the RabbitMQ cluster to be
a single instance.  It's unlikely that Kubernetes RabbitMQ with a
PetSet will be clustered in the same declaritive fashion as the
rabbitmq-clusterer plugin. Easier to just disable it and worry about
how to configure the kube-friendly clustered RabbitMQ at a later point
in time.  Furthermore, it's an entirely valid case for many OpenStack
control planes hosted atop Kolla-Kubernetes to accept the possibility
of a 30-60 second blip in lieu of the long and questionable history
of RabbitMQ clustering in production.

W/o this patch a mongo logs are too huge to be processed by
logrotate without issues.

The solution is to reduce the non debug verbosity level for logs
and do not log all transactions as well (use the quiet option):
* Sync the quiet parameter from puppetlabs-mongodb v0.10.0
* Lower the logs verbosity for a non debug case
* Use the quiet parameter for a non debug case

Currently max number of client connections(i.e greenlets spawned at
a time) opened at any time by the WSGI server is set to 100 with
wsgi_default_pool_size[1].

This configuration may be fine for neutron api server. But with
wsgi_default_pool_size(=100) requests, state change server
is creating heavy cpu load on agent.
So this server(which run on agents) need lesser value i.e
can be configured to half the number of cpu on agent

We use ""ha_keepalived_state_change_server_threads"" config option
to configure number of threads in state change server instead of
wsgi_default_pool_size.

Pinging a floatingip of VM1 from a second VM(VM2) which has SNAT
enabled connected to a DVR router on the same network returns
with fixed-ip address rather than the floatingip address.

The NAT forwarding rules for floatingip in the router namespace
does not check for the in coming port and tries to add the rule
for all in coming ports.

This causes the packets that are originating from the router
namespace to be modified and forwarded directly to the VM2 fixed
ip instead of forwarding the traffic to the SNAT namespace.

The fix in here will make sure that for all routers, the floatingip
forwarding rules will be applied only to the 'rfp-' internal ports
and not to all ports.

The team responsible for the deliverable follows its own unique ways of
doing things.

For example,
- they forked neutron-openvswitch-agent and dragged adoption of official
  plugin hooks (l2 agent extensions) in Newton, making life harder for
  consumers [1][2];
- they don't request releases [3];
- actually, their Mitaka branch is still not ready for consumption [4];
- they spend time on Mitaka release when the whole broader community
  works on shipping Newton bits [4];
- the team does not have any representation in neutron-core, and does
  not seek to expand their involvement into the project at large; I am
  still to find a neutron-core member that is involved in the
  implementation of the API;
- their CI is green for unit testing only (example: [5]).

I believe all that makes it clear that SFC team took their path for
the deliverable, and it would be misleading to suggest that they are
part of the same process that Neutron team follows.

It's fine for projects to follow their paths, and Big Tent is the right
place for that. Neutron Stadium membership requires significantly better
involvement in the life of the community, following its best practices,
and being open to take an extra mile to enhance integration between
participating bits.

At this point, I believe the right thing to do is to allow the team to
follow their own paths and not overburden them with additional
requirements that are probably of no immediate interest to current
contributors.

The initial bug was that the initial 'Starting' log provided by
requestlog had a different request id from the rest of the log
messages for the same request. The initial assumption was that this
was because a request id was not initially available, causing one
to be generated for the first log entry that later was replaced
by the request id middleware.

In the process of debugging that it became clear that the id was
in fact the request id of the previous request because the context
was being reused under the covers in oslo_log and olso_context.

Therefore the auth, context and request id middlewares are now
changed to be active in the middleware stack before the request log
middleware. The unfortunate side effect of this is that the Starting
message and final request logging is no longer actually bounding the
full request: it misses three critical middlewares.

mod-wsgi checks that response header values are what's described
as ""native strings"". This means whatever `str` is in either
python 2 or 3, but never `unicode`. When they are not mod-wsgi
will 500. For the most part this is taken care of by webob, but in
the case of the 405 handling, the webob response is not being
fully massaged.

mod-wsgi is doing this because it supposed to. Python WSGI server
gateways have different expectations of headers depending on whether
the Python is 2 or 3. See

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/#a-note-on-string-types

In addition to the unit test, the gabbi tests are now using a
version of wsgi-intercept that will raise a TypeError when the
application response headers are not using the correct form. This
check needs to be done in wsgi-intercept rather than the gabbi tests
because both wsgi-intercept and the http client makes requests
transform the headers for their own purposes.

This fix ensures that instead of a 500 the correct 405 response
happens.

the one with no context. It still logs an error before doing it to make
sure the operator will see it irrespective of what the caller will do
with the exception.

Also, a note to fellow reviewer: No, I don't think it needs a unit test
case. Do you?

This adds a --until_complete flag to the db archive command, which will
attempt to run batches of max_rows continuously until archiving has
completed (or stops being able to archive anything). We also take care
to catch KeyboardInterrupt so that it will, if stopped, still print
the verbose report at the end. Instead of printing the table on each
iteration, we print some progress information and then provide a completed
summary table at the end of the run.

This also defaults max_rows to a sane value. The previous meaning of not
providing a value was ""archive a whole table in a single operation"",
which was useful only in the most simple of cases. Now that we have
a more reasonable ""do it until you are done"" mechanism, we default this
to 1000 rows for sanity, which also serves as the batch size for the
continuous mode.

The 'assess-status' default handler used @when rather than @hook which
meant that the assess-status hook never actually fired.  This change
corrects that along with a corresponding change to the test helper for

I fixed the example which is described in developer guide to work fine.
These are the main points of this correction.

* specify namespace for NotificationFilter.
* set 2 blank lines between class definitions according to E302 of pep8.
* change argument of 'pool' to keyward arguemnt, because 4th argument of
  'get_notification_listener' requires the name of message executor.

This patch adds a task to ensure that the git folder on the repo
server has the appropriate use:group rights. This ensures that if
a pre-staged git folder is used, the files and folders all have
the correct rights.

Also, the clone script is no longer removed as this is unnecessary
and is helpful for diagnosis of issues.

Finally, some test changes are made in order to ensure that the
ownership change works properly.

In https://review.openstack.org/380553 a change was made to
only execute the clone script if the script changes. This
has resulted in a failure when using a pre-staged git cache.

As the script only executes clone tasks if the git repo is
broken or the SHA isn't in the clone, it's OK to execute it
multiple times.

This patch ensures that the script always runs, but also tries
to add changes to the tests to try to uncover the cause of the
integrated build failure which the previous patch caused.

Additionally, the patch also adds tasks to ensure that the git
folder has the correct owner:group.
