This patch adds the common task file for the mq setup tasks
which will be replicated by the proposal bot between the roles.

It also updates the script that's useful for manual sync to
accommodate the ability to sync the task file. Some documentation
is also added.

This allows sharing of role files from a single location.
It will be used for sharing common tasks of many roles, like
the mq, the dabatase, or service setup.

Without this patch, roles implementing the same kind of files
would eventually drift and be different. This is a problem as
this increases the maintenance burden.

- memcached is referenced in the configuration;
- nova-status seems to be unhappy if the placement API service
  is not enabled.

This scenario may work for now, but a proper Sahara deployment
requires more services (Neutron, Cinder, Glance, etc).
In order to run more advanced Sahara tests, both CLI and client
tempest.lib-based tests, and scenario tests, those services
will need to be added at some point.

vfs_cache_pressure
Setting vfs_cache_pressure to 1 for all cases is likely to cause
excessive memory usage in the dentry and inode caches for most
workloads. For most uses, the default value of 100 is reasonable.

The vfs_cache_pressure value specifies the percentage of objects
in each of the ""dentry"" and ""inode_entry"" slab caches used by
filesystems that will be viewed as ""freeable"" by the slab shrinking
logic. Some other variables also adjust the actual number of objects
that the kernel will try to free, but for the freeable quantity,
a vfs_cache_pressure of 100 will attempt to free 100 times as many
objects in a cache as a setting of 1. Similarly, a vfs_cache_pressure
of 200 will attempt to free twice as many as a setting of 100.

This only comes into play when the kernel has entered reclaim,
i.e., it is trying to free cached objects in order to make space to
satisfy an allocation that would otherwise fail (or an allocation
has already failed or watermarks have been reached and this is
occurring asynchronously). By setting vfs_cache_pressure to 1,
the kernel will disproportionately reclaim pages from the page
cache instead of from the dentry/inode caches, and those will
grow with almost no bound (if vfs_cache_pressure is 0, they will
literally grow without bound until memory is exhausted).

If the system as a whole has a low cache hit ratio on the objects
in the dentry and inode caches, they will simply consume memory
that is kept idle, and force out page cache pages (file data,
block data and anonymous pages). Eventually, the system will resort
to swapping of pages and if all else fails to killing processes to
free memory. With very low vfs_cache_pressure values, it is more
likely that processes will be killed to free memory before
dentry / inode cache objects are released.

We have had several customers alleviate problems be setting
thus value back to the defaults - or having to make them
higher to clean things up after being at 1 for so long.

vm.swappiness
Setting this to 1 will heavily favor (ratio 1:199) releasing file
backed pages over writing anonymous pages to swap (""swapping"" a
file backed page just frees the page, as it can be re-read from
its backing file). So, this would, e.g., favor keeping almost all
process anonymous pages (stack, heap, etc), even for idle processes,
in memory over keeping file backed pages in the page cache.

In each service, we should use x_oslomsg_rpc_password and
x_oslomsg_notify_password, and not rabbitmq.

When scaling ceph monitors, ceph-ansible uses context from the
fetch_directory to prevent new monitors from behaving like they
are the only monitors.

Save the fetch_directory in swift after each ceph-ansible playbook
run; and if there is a fetch directory in swift, restore it before
each playbook run.

In before, filtering of AZs is using the filter implementation of
agents. To filter the AZs, users need to find the AZ fields to filter,
locate their corresponding fields in agent, and compile the filters
based on the mapping between AZ and agent. This is undesirable.

This patch improve the filtering of AZ by converting the AZ filters
to agent filters. The supporting AZ filters are:
* name: the name of the availability zone
* state: the value is either 'available' or 'unavailable'
* resource: the value is either 'network' or 'router'

NOTE: For backward-compatibility, the old filters still works but
its usage is discourage.

APIImpact: Add filters to specify attributes of availability zones

The MySQL commands that we run during the upgrade of MySQL are useful
when upgrading a non-containerized undercloud (from instack-undercloud)
to a containerized undercloud, because we need to rename the Neutron
database to match with the defaults in THT.
So these 2 steps are only useful when MariaDB was actually running on
the host and not in a container.
Adding a conditional that checks if MariaDB is running and then we can
run these MySQL commands will ensure we can run the undercloud upgrade
in Rocky and beyond.

The current ""agent remove-add"" method to reschedule a router is not
friendly for DVR. In DVR cases, the old agent may still need to keep the
router in a non-master role to service any VM ports that exit on that
host while the new agent handles the master role of the router.

This patch proposes to send ""update"" instead of ""remove"" notification
for DVR rescheduling, which aligns with the retain_router check in
remove_router_from_l3_agent as well.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that

There were some recent changes to oslo.policy that include specific

  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/578995/

The above change allows consuming projects to pass instances
of oslo_context.context.RequestContext to the policy enforcer, as
opposed to building a dictionary instance from scratch multiple
different ways across projects.

The glance unit tests were failing with the new version of
oslo.policy (1.38.0) because they were passing in a Mock instance
which failed the new, more strict, type check.

This commit converts the setUp class of the tests to use an instance
of glance.context.RequestContext, which subclasses RequestContext
from oslo.context. It also sets the user_id and project_id attributes
of the context object to override authorization checks.

This should allow glance to pass with newer versions of oslo.policy.

To allow other openstack projects switch from the deprecated pyldap
library to python-ldap we need to enable it as part of global-requirements.
After the transition path is complete we can remove pyldap (which is merely
a wrapper around python-ldap meanwhile, so it is effectively a noop).

Is the library actively maintained?
Yes - last release less than two months ago

Is the library good code?
Should be, it was the best of breedh from old ldap module and pyldap
(which introduced api fixes for python 3.x compatibility)

Is the library python 3 compatible?
Yes

Is the library license compatible?
Yes - PSF

Is the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu latest
/ Fedora latest)?

Yes, already part of Ubuntu Bionic.

Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries in
global-requirements.txt?

Yes, pyldap is the deprecated but already contained library.

Is the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or
infrastructure setup? (Answer to this should be Yes, of course) Which?

Yes, needed by keystone and others.

Commit 875fa96f / change-id Ief0040f6 unintentionally tries to enlarge
the ""machines00"" LV when LXC is the default container technology which
fails due to the Debian automated installation having assigned all the
space within the associated ""vmvg00"" VG.

As the intention of the aforementioned commit was to apply when
systemd-nspawn was used, codify that explicitly in a `when:` condition
on the problematic Ansible task.

Previously install_command specifies upper-constraints
so lower-constraints actually did not work.
upper-constraints must be specified via 'deps' instead of 'install_command'.

The fix reveals that django-formtools 1.0 is not compatible with
Django 1.11 or later. django-formtools 2.0 seems the minimum requirement.

Castellan 0.16.0 is not compatible with murano-dashboard because there is
barbican_endpoint_type. The minimum required version is 0.18.0.

This commit also drops Django dependency in requirements.txt.
After commit 7e91070789187d9e6b5ac2b57ca755504e058e32 in

have lower bounds and Django entry hits this.

The tripleo firewall module has fundamentally three pieces:
1) firewall::pre (allows existing connections/ssh/icmp)
2) firewall::rule (allows services traffic)
3) firewall::post (drops all traffic)

One of the assumptions coded in the module is the following line:
Service<||> -> Class['tripleo::firewall::post']

Which has been added so that (see also bug LP#1643575):
""""""
use ordering to make sure we start all Services in catalog before post
rules. It ensure that we don't drop all traffic before starting the
services, which could lead to services errors (e.g. trying to reach database or amqp)
""""""

The problem is that there is nothing specifying that the firewall rules
created by tripleo services need to be implemented between the pre and
post classes. So the following can happen:
Jul 10 05:04:13 overcloud-controller-1 systemd: Started OpenSSH server daemon.

This means that we can actually open the traffic for our services *after*
said traffic has been completely blocked. In order to fix this we
tag the pre/post rules with a different tag and add resource collectors
to actually enforce proper ordering. We now get:
...
Jul 11 08:54:43 overcloud-controller-0 puppet-user[32554]: (/Stage[main]/Tripleo::Firewall::Pre/Tripleo::Firewall::Rule[000 accept related established rules]/Firewall[000 accept related established rules ipv4]/ensure) created

Tested this by doing 20 deploys of 1ctrl+1cmp and then scaling up the
overcloud to 3ctrl+2cmp.

The reason this change, besides being semantically correct, is needed
for scaling up the controller role is the following:
1) When we detect a scaleup situation, we call 'pcs cluster node add <newnode>'
   from the bootstrap node

2) It can happen that 1) succeeds because the node still had no iptables
   at all, so pcs communication succeeds. So at this point the cluster
   has added a new node and all is well

3) Now we apply the pre and post rules and all traffic is blocked. And
   slowly we start adding rules to let services be accessible over the
   network.

4) pacemaker is unable to talk to other nodes and assumes a network split.
   Eventually it will start fencing node to guarantee the state of the
   remote nodes and so the deploy will fail.

With this change if the 'pcs cluster node add' call succeeds we are
guaranteed to not interrupt network traffic afterwards.

Since pysnmp 4.3 (which dates back to 2015), library's high-level
SNMP API has been reworked towards better consistency and performance.
Ironic snmp driver still uses the older pysnmp API. This story
suggests migrating ironic snmp driver to the latest (e.g.
post 4.3) pysnmp API.

This bumps up ironic lower constraint on pysnmp.

This patch adds an environment file to enable sriov agent with OVN. It is expected to
include the environment file - environments/services/neutron-ovn-sriov.yaml
after including the main OVN environment file. The main OVN environment files
(neutron-ovn-ha.yaml, neutron-ovn-dvr-ha.yaml) disables  all the neutron agent
services.

ovn-controller service responds to the DHCP requests from the VMs.
But in the case of SRIOV VMs, ovn-controller won't be able to capture the traffic sent
via SRIOV directly to the switch. So neutron-ovn-sriov.yaml enables dhcp agent.

However, if we use 'connection: local' and 'become: yes'
together, it works properly.

The idea behind the version-map code is to work around a lack of a node
that has multiple python3 versions by taking a freeze from one version
(say python-3.5) and cloning that to another (say python-3,4).  This was
written to facilitate the transition from trusty (3.4) to xenial (3.5).

With the transition from xenial (3.5) to bionic (3.6) we need to do
something similar.  To aid the transition it'd be nice to be able to
duplicate a 3.5 freeze to both 3.4 *and* 3.6.  The current version_map
doesn't allow for that.

Enhance the version_map code to accommodate this situation.  The idea
would be to backport this as far as Ocata[1]

Ever since we introduced support for setting multiple consumers in a
single POST /allocations, the AllocationList.delete_all() method has
been housing a latent bad assumption and bug.

The AllocationList.delete_all() method used to assume that the
AllocationList's Allocation objects were only ever for a single
consumer, and took a shortcut in deleting the allocation by deleting all
allocations with the ""first"" Allocation's consumer UUID:

```python
    def delete_all(self):
        # Allocations can only have a single consumer, so take advantage of
        # that fact and do an efficient batch delete
        consumer_uuid = self.objects[0].consumer.uuid
        _delete_allocations_for_consumer(self._context, consumer_uuid)
        consumer_obj.delete_consumers_if_no_allocations(
            self._context, [consumer_uuid])
```

The problem with the above is that if you get all the allocations for a
single resource provider, using
AllocationList.get_all_by_resource_provider() and there are more than
one consumer allocating resources against that provider, then calling
AllocationList.delete_all() will only delete *some* of the resource
provider's allocations, not all of them.

Luckily, the handler code has never used AllocationList.delete_all()
after calling AllocationList.get_all_by_resource_provider(), and so
we've not hit this latent bug in production.

However, in the next patch in this series (the reshaper DB work), we
*do* call AllocationList.delete_all() for allocation lists for each
provider involved in the reshape operation, which is why this fix is
important to get done correctly.

Note that this patch renames AllocationList.create_all() to
AllocationList.replace_all() to make it absolutely clear that all of
the allocations for all consumers in the list are first *deleted* by the
codebase and then re-created. We also remove the check in
AllocationList.create_all() that the Allocation objects in the list must
not have an 'id' field set. The reason for that is because in order to
properly implement AllocationList.delete_all() to call DELETE FROM
allocations WHERE id IN (<...>) we need the list of allocation record
internal IDs. These id field values are now properly set on the
Allocation objects when AllocationList.get_all_by_resource_provider()

returned object to have delete_all() called on it and the DELETE
statement to work properly.

Detect if crm_diff is fixed and if it is favour the crm_diff resource

Tested this as follows:
1) Normal deploys work fine (the code never gets triggered anyway)
2) Redeploy with no changes -> pcmk resources are untouched
   (the code does not get triggered anyway)
3) Redeploy by adding the following hiera keys:
   ExtraConfig:
     pacemaker::resource::bundle::deep_compare: true
     pacemaker::resource::ip::deep_compare: true
     pacemaker::resource::ocf::deep_compare: true
   -> pcmk resources are untouched
4) Redeploy with keys at 3) but with changes that trigger a restart
   -> pcmk resources are restarted and cluster waits for the
      restart before continuing

In fullstack test which is testing if there is no packet lost
during restart of agents there were restarted always all agents
which hosted router.
In case when as first was restarted 'master' agent it might
lead to the case when after restart 'master' node was switched
to second L3 agent and that caused lost of few packets and
failed test.
This test should only check if restart of standby agents will
not cause any packet lost so this patch do it in this way.

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run

As part of planning out the python3 transition we realized that in
order to have a self-testing patch in each repository to switch the
documentation build to use python3, we would need to include some
information in the repository that the job would read to decide which
version of python to use. After considering several options, we
realized that this requirement meant we had set the API for the
documentation jobs at the wrong ""level"" of the stack.

This patch restores the use of tox for building documentation in the
standard project testing interface. Rather than using the ""venv""
environment, it specifies a new environment for ""docs"", based on the
common pattern we have in most projects to provide that as a
convenience for developers.

The Python-specific notes about adding the environment as a
convenience are removed, since it is now required.

At the moment, the keepalived ping tests are something that is
configured by default which is ideal because it's hardcoded with
a public IP address that might result in a failing deployment
if the environment does not for some reason reach it.

We should leave the option to be there however not have all default
deployments hitting this IP as it can introduce behaviour where
if that IP fails, every single OpenStack Ansible deployment would
fail afterwards.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because of that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

The tripleo firewall module has fundamentally three pieces:
1) firewall::pre (allows existing connections/ssh/icmp)
2) firewall::rule (allows services traffic)
3) firewall::post (drops all traffic)

One of the assumptions coded in the module is the following line:
Service<||> -> Class['tripleo::firewall::post']

Which has been added so that (see also bug LP#1643575):
""""""
use ordering to make sure we start all Services in catalog before post
rules. It ensure that we don't drop all traffic before starting the
services, which could lead to services errors (e.g. trying to reach database or amqp)
""""""

The problem is that there is nothing specifying that the firewall rules
created by tripleo services need to be implemented between the pre and
post classes. So the following can happen:
Jul 10 05:04:13 overcloud-controller-1 systemd: Started OpenSSH server daemon.

This means that we can actually open the traffic for our services *after*
said traffic has been completely blocked. In order to fix this we
tag the pre/post rules with a different tag and add resource collectors
to actually enforce proper ordering. We now get:
...
Jul 11 08:54:43 overcloud-controller-0 puppet-user[32554]: (/Stage[main]/Tripleo::Firewall::Pre/Tripleo::Firewall::Rule[000 accept related established rules]/Firewall[000 accept related established rules ipv4]/ensure) created

Tested this by doing 20 deploys of 1ctrl+1cmp and then scaling up the
overcloud to 3ctrl+2cmp.

The reason this change, besides being semantically correct, is needed
for scaling up the controller role is the following:
1) When we detect a scaleup situation, we call 'pcs cluster node add <newnode>'
   from the bootstrap node

2) It can happen that 1) succeeds because the node still had no iptables
   at all, so pcs communication succeeds. So at this point the cluster
   has added a new node and all is well

3) Now we apply the pre and post rules and all traffic is blocked. And
   slowly we start adding rules to let services be accessible over the
   network.

4) pacemaker is unable to talk to other nodes and assumes a network split.
   Eventually it will start fencing node to guarantee the state of the
   remote nodes and so the deploy will fail.

With this change if the 'pcs cluster node add' call succeeds we are
guaranteed to not interrupt network traffic afterwards.

In case of HA routers IPv6 forwarding is not disabled by default and
then enabled only on master node.
Before this patch it was done in opposite way, so forwarding was
enabled by default and then disabled on backup nodes.
When forwarding was enabled/disabled for qg- port, MLDv2 packets are
sent and that might lead to temportary packets loss as packets to
FIP were sent to this backup node instead of master one.

Followup patch to rephrase 'cloud-backed' to indicate that
sushy-emulator is backed by libvirt or OpenStack cloud.

Change to use 'emulator' instead of 'simulator' across the docs.
As these emulators are used to substitute real Redfish BMC and
work to have same input/output as Redfish BMC, 'emulator' is the
term to use.
