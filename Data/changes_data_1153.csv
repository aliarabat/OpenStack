Previously using the ClearRequestContext fixture only reset contexts
on fixture teardown. If *all* tests in a test suite use this fixture,
this is fine. However if any tests do not, it means you might start
with a carry over context from previous tests.

Using this fixture means you really wanted a clean slate, so fix it so
that you get a clean state when you get started as well as when you
finish.

It is not clear why this is a configurable option. The original
blueprint just wanted the ability to specify a policy.d infrastructure
to make complex policies easier to enforce. There was no requirement
on it being configurable.

Being configurable just exposes another way in which incompatibilities
in OpenStack projects might be able to emerge. As this merged late in
the incubator lifecycle for the policy code, there are likely few/no
existing users of the option so it should be safe to deprecate it
for the library.  That way we won't break anyone currently using it,
and don't have to commit to supporting it going forward.

This patch allows the SQLAlchemy DB API to talk to any arbitrary

information of the target database and the uses the augmented context to
instantiate the SQLAlchemy engine/session objects.
If the default unaugmented context is used, the DB API connects to the database
specified in the configuration file.

Creates classes representing the 3 types of namespaces handled by the L3 agent:
router, snat and fip.

The scope of this change is:

- Creation and deletion methods are provided for each namespace class
- Creation and deletion of router and snat namespaces are moved to the router
  classes. These namespaces are now members of the corresponding router class
- Invocation of Fip namespace creation and deletion is left in the agent, since
  the agent owns it
- A context manager is provided to move the namespaces (router and snat)
  cleanup code out of the agent

A follow up patchset will add methods to create and delete interfaces in the
namespaces. These methods are intended to be used by the router classes

When an image is deleted, the image data is not being deleted
completely if it is stored as static large object(SLO). Only the
manifest is deleted leaving behind all the segments. This leads to
stale data in swift cluster.

This change attempts to delete the SLO in the following way:
 1. Identify a SLO with 'x-static-large-object' header on an object
 2. Delete the SLO, both manifest and the segments, using the
 query string 'multipart-manifest=delete' while deleting the object

During testing of scale heat rally test for neutron
(HeatStack.create_and_delete_stack) is falling because neutron
creates multiple security groups but nova cannot define which one
should it use. As a result nova cannot boot an instance.
The fix defines default security group in the
server_with_ports.yaml.template, so nova will choose
the one specific group.
In addition, the deprecated attribute network_id in the template
has been replaced with the network attribute.

Working with versions of various objects is a common problem, which already has
a number of market-adopted solutions. One of these solutions is Semantic
Versioning - a system of rules and requirements for assigning version numbers
to software components and other objects. One can find the specification for
SemVer freely at http://semver.org

It is proposed to add support of the semantic versioning concept into Glance,
so Glance objects (starting from Artifacts, but probably including Images in
future) may be properly versioned.

Implement the auth plugin noted for K2K federation.  The existing
Saml2ScopedToken plugin works for getting a scoped token.

This is marked WIP for 2 reasons:
1)  Unit tests (I'm working this)
2)  I wonder if this should merge in function defined in
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/159022/
so that the API user doesn't have to get the SAML at all.
Instead this plugin could be enhanced to just accept a scoped token
for the IDP, could perform the samlization as well, and return the
unscoped token for the SP.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --astute, -a   Parse Astute log
  --puppet, -p   Parse Puppet logs
  --clear, -c    Clear the logs on the master node
  --sort, -s     Sort Puppet logs by date
  --evals, -e    Show Puppet evaltrace lines

Using anywhere to view Fuel snapshot data:

Using on the live Fuel Master node:

fuel_logs.py -a View the current Astute log
fuel_logs.py -p View the current Puppet logs

Using without -a and -p options assumes both options

fuel_logs.py -c Truncates Astute and Puppet logs. Respects -a and -p options.

It you are running and debugging many deployments on a single master node
you may want to truncate the logs from the previous deployments. Using -l
option is aslo recomended for interactive use.

The Dell Storage Center driver is failing snapshot creation on
later versions of the Dell REST API.

The doNotExpire option was removed in API 15.3.1.110.  We were
setting this so that the replays are not expired and removed when
Cinder expects them to still be there.  This has been replaced by
setting expiretime to 0.  We were doing this already so the fix
was to simply remove doNotExpire from the REST request payload.

This will fail on every future release of the Dell Storage Center
so this is a critical fix.

Unit tests have been updated to ensure that the keypair

This replaces the current very-limited search by attribute by the full
complex query system we implemented in the indexer.

It's exposed instead as POST /v1/search/resource/<type>.

Currently, we're using a Keystone client which actually performs
auto discovering and returns one of available client. In theory
all works fine, but unfortunately the ""auth_url"" will be replaced
by Keystone with a keystone endpoint. The issue is that this
endpoint may be unavailable if we're working through some
proxy/tunnel and don't have direct access to the fuel master node.

As workaround, we can explicitly create a keystone client for v2.0,
and none of discovering will be performed and the endpoint will not
be replaced implicitly by keystone client.

 * Ceilometer agent central and ceilometer alarm evaluator

 * Disable upstart for this two services

 It does not make sense to have started ceilometer-central-agent
 without coordination, also it does not make sense to have
 started ceilometer-alarm-evaluator more than one per claster.
 This is disoriented users only. So here we enabled
 this services via pacemaker. This change should be
 present in 6.0 too.

Currently neutron-ns-metadata-proxy runs with root permissions when
namespaces are enabled on the dhcp agent because root permissions are
required to ""enter"" in the namespace. But neutron-ns-metadata-proxy
permissions should be reduced as much as possible because it is
reachable from vms.

This change allows to change neutron-ns-metadata-proxy permissions
after its startup through the 2 new options metadata_proxy_user and
metadata_proxy_group which allow to define user/group running metadata
proxy after its initialization. Their default values are
neutron-dhcp-agent effective user and group.

This change delegates metadata proxy management to metadata driver
methods in order to reuse the work already done on l3 agent side.

Permissions drop is done after metadata proxy daemon writes its
pid in its pidfile (it could be disallowed after permissions drop) and
after metadata proxy daemon binds its privileged server port (80).

Using nobody as metadata_proxy_user/group (more secure) is currently
not supported because:

* nobody has not the permission to connect the metadata socket,
* nobody has not the permission to log to file because neutron uses
  WatchedFileHandler (which requires read/write permissions after
  permissions drop).
This limitation will be addressed in a daughter change.

W/o this patch, haproxy daemon under load never can
be stopped gracefully and it also may exceed given stop/monitor
timeouts ending up being restarted by pacemaker.

The solution is:
* increase haproxy resource monitor/stop timeout and interval
* fix stop action for OCF to not rely on kill command exit codes
* wrap kill in retries and issue a SIGKILL only if there are no more
  retries left for gracefull termination
* add debug parameter for haproxy RA OCF script and provide more
  logging as well
* set debug for haproxy RA, if global debug is enabled

It shows the occupation of the most critical hardware resources (from
a performance point of view) on system level, i.e. cpu, memory, disk

* Keep recorded data in binary format in /var/log/atop directory for

With Ibca4b1765d06f239df113aa3ec367e60de61a225 a dependency on
cryptography was introduced.

This is causing issues for the centos7 devstack jobs.  cryptography
attempting to be installed before it's dependency ""six"".

I have filed an upstream issue with pip about this [1].  In the
mean-time, re-ordering the dependency should allow things to install
correctly.

This probably doesn't happen on Ubuntu because it ships with a version
of six that allows the cryptography package to at least install.

Whitespace should be consistent inside of local_settings.py.example.

Currently, most comments in side our settings files follow the ""space
after # mark"" guideline. This is as it should be. However, commented out
code-lines are inconsistently including that space. Most of the time
they don't include it.

There's a case to be made for either approach:

Do include the space after the #:
    Keeps things consistent and it's how pyflakes likes things.

Do not include the space after the #:
    Identifies the commented out line as potential code, instead of a
    descriptive comment.

    Makes it easier to just remove the '#' character to activate the
    line of code. Specifically with python, leaving the white space is
    likely bad.

An informal survey of the lines in these files shows that most commented
out code lines do not have a space, and I agree with that policy. I'd
like to make this the policy and clean up the code.

Also added trailing ',' chars on the last element of many lists.

The data argument for process/update method of extension driver
was inconsist. some are given data like

This inconsistency needs to be fixed so that argument is

In Juno, we used keepalived notifier scripts to report the local
state of an HA router's state. These have been found to be
unreliable. The proposed approach is to not use them altogether.
Instead, monitor the omnipresent VIP on the HA device - It is
only configured on the master instance. In order to do that,
we'll use the 'ip monitor address' wrapper introduced in this patch
to get address change events as they happen to avoid polling.

If we're doing a lot of build operations, we are using a large portion
of the limited rpc worker pool for long periods of time. Since we may wait
on external services (like neutron or glance) during those times, we could
fully deplete that pool.

This patch makes us spawn a new greenthread for that task and return the
rpc worker to the pool. Due to some funkiness with the stack of decorators,
this breaks the inner function out to an object method, which is probably
good anyway, given its size. This also moves the wrap_instance_event
decorator to the inner function so that the start and stop events properly
demarcate the actual task and not just the (now very quick) RPC call.

Cells prepend full cell path to the service ID before returning any
service related info. This means service ID is non numeric and can't
be cast into Service objects.  In cells, service_get_all method
in HostAPI (which is used to display list of services) strips out
the cell path from received IDs, creates Service objects using
remaining numerical ID and uses a ServiceProxy to associate cell paths
Service objects.
However, other service related methods do not do so. They include:
 - service_update (Used for enabling/disabling services)
 - service_get_all_by_host (Used for evacuation)
These functions try to cast received service info (with alphanumeric
service IDs) into Service objects and fail with a ValueError.
This leads to API cell throwing Error 500 for service-enable,
service-disable and evacuate.
This patch extends the ServiceProxy usage to both these methods. It
also changes the corresponding HostAPI tests.

Note: The required unit-tests are manually added to the below path,
as new path for unit-tests is not present in stable/icehouse release.

The commit d9155521539e5e67f0984c180267fc91cc17c738 added
exceptions with one too many %.

The format should be as follows:

class ExceptionExample(exceptions.NeutronException):
    message = _('Invalid input %(input)s')

It is called by raise.ExceptionExample(input=input)

The patch also fixes a typo with InvalidAuthenticationTypeExecption.

The original code had a 'blockdev' which represented local disk types.
However, with volume support, the term 'block' became ambiguous.  This
change set modifies the blockdev to be named as a 'driver' under the
disk folder.

This provides consistency with the volume driver.

Also updated the generic 'StorageAdapter' within blockdev to be a
'DiskAdapter'.  That more accurately describes its purpose.

The use of launchpadlib should not be required for tempest-lib, however
because we wanted to expose the skip_tracker as an entry point and
package it with the library an import to launchpadlib was needed in the
packaged source, which normally should require an entry in the
requirements file. This commit addresses that by making the
launchpadlib use not mandatory. The script will check if launchpadlib
is available and if it isn't the skip tracker will just exit after it
scans for the bug list.

The extant Manila driver for cDOT supports multi-svm mode only
(i.e. driver_handles_share_servers = True).  This commit adds
a single-svm cDOT driver (driver_handles_share_servers = False)
for simpler operation without network plug-ins.  To work in this
mode the storage admin must pre-create a vserver with the desired
LIFs and protocols configured, and specify the vserver in
the config variable 'netapp_vserver'.

To configure this driver, use a config like the following:

[cmode]
share_driver = manila.share.drivers.netapp.common.NetAppDriver
driver_handles_share_servers = False
netapp_storage_family = ontap_cluster
netapp_server_hostname=192.168.228.42

If compareCPU fails, libvirt will throw exception libvirtError.
Libvirt driver catches this exception and rethrows it, however
conductor manager doesn't expect such exception. This causes
problem with instance task state - it is stuck in MIGRATION state.

Because compareCPU method is part of live migration pre-checks,
this patch changes exception that is reraised in libvirt driver
from libvirt.libvirtError to exception.MigrationPreCheckError.

This change also adds unit tests for compareCPU method.

Ant needs a path that is local to the directory from which it operates.
To be able to publish our logs, we need to symlink /openstack/log to
/home/jenkins/workspace/os-ansible-deployment-dvsm-check-commit/logs.

This also allows us to remove the log publisher we wrote and just use
the devstack-logs publisher instead.

It is not clear why this is a configurable option. The original
blueprint just wanted the ability to specify a policy.d infrastructure
to make complex policies easier to enforce. There was no requirement
on it being configurable.

Being configurable just exposes another way in which incompatibilities
in OpenStack projects might be able to emerge. As this is an early
release, we should just remove the function before it's in an
OpenStack release.

This change set provides the volume connector for the nova_powervm
driver.  It currently gathers all of the WWPNs off of all VIOS.

The current implementation requires a restart of the agent if there are
changes to the VIOS (ex. a new VIOS is installed).

This change set also updates the behaviors within the local devices (ex.
non-Cinder backed).  If there is a boot cinder volume specified, then
the local disk will no longer create a disk.  This should be in line
with standard driver support.

This change set will allow a provision of a VM with a cinder backed
volume.  However, that volume is only visible to the Host server.  Not
to the VM as the connection between the VM and the hdisk is not part of
this change.

We were going through a bunch of trouble to make the servicegroup API
object a singleton, and only check configuration options once. This made
the unit tests for the servicegroup drivers more complex than they
needed to be. In this patch, we just change the SG API object's
constructor to check the appropriate servicegroup configuration options
as it needs to, and we adapt the unit tests for all of the SG drivers to
not involve the Service object at all.

The memcache and DB driver unit tests are converted to NoDBTestCase
derivatives, reducing the runtime for the two test cases from around 8
seconds (~1 second per test method) to less than 0.20 seconds.

NOTE: The ZooKeeper driver's unit test never runs at all. It is always
skipped.

NOTE: The next patch in this series refactors the service group API
to make the behaviour of all drivers consistent. Currently, the
Zookeeper driver has different behaviour from the other drivers in the
get_all() method: it raises exception.ServiceGroupUnavailable() if no
services are found, unlike the DB and MC drivers, which just return an
empty list. Similarly, the ZK driver's join() method returns a
FakeLoopingCall() object for some reason, while the other drivers return
None.

Currently we only output the config file contents in noop mode,
but it's very useful to see what would be done in terms of taking
interfaces up and down, and especially what will be removed when
--cleanup mode is specified

So this refactors the operations skipped by noop into the base-class
so we can conveniently log what they would do when --noop is selected.

MatchMakerRedis is the only tested routing method
for ZeroMQ driver. For others, like MatchMakerLocalhost
and MatchMakerRing, it still takes some time to work
on and completely test.

MatchMakerRedis is enough to run under real-world
deployment.

The SecretDTO should encapsulate the secret as a Base64 string.  The
translations module was decoding Base64 secrets before inserting them
into the SecretDTO that was later passed to the SecretStores, and it
was not encoding plain text into Base64 as well. This code fixes that.

Previously, attempting to upload data to an image which has a status
which is not 'queued' would appear to succeed, when the data has
actually never been sent to the glance server. To the user, it appeared
that their request was successful. This patch adds a check for incoming
image data on the 'image-update' command, and exits with an error if the
specified image does not have the status 'queued'.

Examples:

    $ cat os.img | glance image-update d50b0236-b27c-412a-91b9-18ceafa9cc5a
    Unable to upload image data to an image which is active.

If the VM's VNIC has been removed, disconnecting the

Commit 425b6df4f5e5035f0206ffdc601668234fcfc867 added some filtering on
the repo name to account for special cases where the repo name in
git.o.o does not match the project name in launchpad. That prevents
using release_library.sh with projects like python-novaclient.

This adds some logic to check if the project name is of the form
python-*client and if so, assumes the repo name and project in launchpad
are the same. Also updates the comment in the code about the special
case projects for context.
