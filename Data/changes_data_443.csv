It could happen that instance does not have a host set, e.g.

During online_migration, populate_missing_availability_zones tries to
add missing AZs to all instances. However for instances without a host
there's no reasonable value for AZ (we can't use a logic that bases

There is a DEBUG log coming from the notification sending code path
that tries to populate the notification payload from a nova OVO and
encounters an unset / non-lazy loadable field in the source OVO.
As there are fields like MonitorMetric.numa_membw_values that are
notorious unset in many circumstances but used in the MetricPayload
we got excessive DEBUG logging from this code path.

This patch removes the offending logging statement as soo far we failed
to found cases based on this log where anything else we could do than
what the code anyhow does, defaulting the payload field to None.

Currently, Magnum is running periodic tasks to collect k8s cluster
metrics to message bus. Unfortunately, it's collecting pods info
only from ""default"" namespace which makes this function useless.
What's more, even Magnum can get all pods from all namespaces, it
doesn't make much sense to keep this function in Magnum. Because
operators only care about the health of cluster nodes. If they
want to know the status of pods, they can use heapster or other
tools to get that.

Currently we instantiate a novaclient.client Client object without explicitely
passing any endpoint_type in kwargs. The Client object defaults to using
'publicURL': https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient/blob/stable/queens/novaclient/client.py#L116

In some environments the access to publicURL is not desired and likely the wrong default.
So this needs to be a) configureable and b) default to internalURL when nothing is specified.

We make this configurable by leveraging the os_interface key in the
placement section of nova.conf as that is what specifies the endpoint
type since ocata: https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/nova/ocata.html#other-notes

We also check for the existance of the [placement]/valid_interface key
and will use that instead if it is present as it is the proper
recommended way to get this information as of queens (see
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/492247/). Since it is a list
of preferred endpoint URLs, we take the first one.

Tested by making sure via tcpdump that the internal_url was being hit
after restarting the nova_compute container with the patched code:

This patch enable the option of dynamically selecting the
neutron net where the pods will be plugged. To achiveve this it uses
annotations. For example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: busybox-sleep1
  annotations:
   openstack.org/neutron-net: 130b061f-dbff-4dfa-b5a7-f2e8df3e1b23
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    args:
    - sleep
    - ""1000000""

This will attach the pod to the Neutron net 130b061f-XXX, assuming
only one subnet per network

ironic inspector utilizes Werkzeug as underlying http service, which
uses one process by default, and we have no means to configure the
number of api processes at this time.

This patch adds a new option named api_workers, thus the concurrency
behavior can be configured by user.

This depends on the separation of api and worker, which is part of the
feature of ironic inspector HA support, it can't pass CI or work until
that work is done.

The VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SUSPENDED_MIGRATED event is sent when live
migration completes but does not indicate if the migration was
successful or a failure, for that we need to check the actual
job status.

For now, to fix the regression introduced in change
Ic5cab99944df9e501ba2032eb96911c36304494d in Rocky and mitigate
the risk of a change in the Rocky GA, we just don't deal with
that event. In the case of live migration failing, things are the
same as before Rocky. In the case of live migration success, we
activate the destination host port bindings in _post_live_migration
so the network downtime benefit is not realized in that case, but
we also don't mess up the network with incorrectly activating the
dest host port bindings in ComputeManager.handle_lifecycle_event.
If post-copy is in effect, we still get the reduced network downtime
benefit from blueprint neutron-new-port-binding-api.

This is a partial fix and the full fix will include checking the
job status when we get VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SUSPENDED_MIGRATED but is
likely too risky of a change for the Rocky GA.

Add a test that traverses all available placement URLs at the latest
microversion and tries to access them as non-admin. If something other
than a 403 response is given a failed test with a message like

    method POST on route /resource_providers/{uuid}/inventories
    is open for user, status: 404

is produced.

This works because we do authZ handling early in each handler, before
data processing and path parameter handling.

The method is pretty straightforward: traverse ROUTE_DECLARATIONS, visit
every url with each the declared methods, except the root version document,
and confirm a 403 response when the provided auth token is non-admin.

This has been created to avoid situations where a route is added without
policy like happened on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/576927/ . Until
recently we had a failover where any route not defined to have policy
would default to admin. That went away so now we need some test
automation to catch our forgetful humanness.

Currently we instantiate a novaclient.client Client object without explicitely
passing any endpoint_type in kwargs. The Client object defaults to using
'publicURL': https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient/blob/stable/queens/novaclient/client.py#L116

In some environments the access to publicURL is not desired and likely the wrong default.
So this needs to be a) configureable and b) default to internalURL when nothing is specified.

We make this configurable by leveraging the os_interface key in the
placement section of nova.conf as that is what specifies the endpoint
type since ocata: https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/nova/ocata.html#other-notes

We also check for the existance of the [placement]/valid_interface key
and will use that instead if it is present as it is the proper
recommended way to get this information as of queens (see
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/492247/). Since it is a list
of preferred endpoint URLs, we take the first one.

Tested by making sure via tcpdump that the internal_url was being hit
after restarting the nova_compute container with the patched code:

The VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SUSPENDED_MIGRATED event is sent when live
migration completes but does not indicate if the migration was
successful or a failure, for that we need to check the actual
job status.

For now, to fix the regression introduced in change
Ic5cab99944df9e501ba2032eb96911c36304494d in Rocky and mitigate
the risk of a change in the Rocky GA, we just don't deal with
that event. In the case of live migration failing, things are the
same as before Rocky. In the case of live migration success, we
activate the destination host port bindings in _post_live_migration
so the network downtime benefit is not realized in that case, but
we also don't mess up the network with incorrectly activating the
dest host port bindings in ComputeManager.handle_lifecycle_event.
If post-copy is in effect, we still get the reduced network downtime
benefit from blueprint neutron-new-port-binding-api.

This is a partial fix and the full fix will include checking the
job status when we get VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SUSPENDED_MIGRATED but is
likely too risky of a change for the Rocky GA.

This patch implements the provider driver as per the guidelines
mentioned here [1]. In order to load OVN provider driver,
'enabled_provider_drivers' in octavia.conf should define
'ovn:OVN provider driver'. To create a load balancer with ovn
provider driver, the 'provider': 'ovn' should be passed to the
POST of /v2.0/lbaas/loadbalancers.

OVN Northbound db has a table 'Load_Balancer'. This patch creates
a row for each load balancer created and updates the 'external_ids'
and 'vips' column of this table whenever a pool, member or listener
is created/updated or deleted.

There are few TODOs (which can be follow up patches)
  - Add documentation about how to enable this feature
  - Add a design document
  - Add a CI job. Presently the octavia tempest plugin creates the pools
    and listeners with HTTP protocol. We need to enhance the octavia
    tempest tests to use TCP for provider drivers not supporting HTTP.

Currently, Magnum is running periodic tasks to collect k8s cluster
metrics to message bus. Unfortunately, it's collecting pods info
only from ""default"" namespace which makes this function useless.
What's more, even Magnum can get all pods from all namespaces, it
doesn't make much sense to keep this function in Magnum. Because
operators only care about the health of cluster nodes. If they
want to know the status of pods, they can use heapster or other
tools to get that.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

When replacing a provider's set of aggregate associations, we were
issuing a call to:

 DELETE resource_provider_aggregates WHERE resource_provider_id = $rp

and then a single call to:

 INSERT INTO resource_provider_aggregates
 SELECT $rp, aggs.id
 FROM provider_aggregates AS aggs
 WHERE aggs.uuid IN ($agg_uuids)

This patch changes the _set_aggregates() function in a few ways.
First, we grab the aggregate's internal ID value when creating new
aggregate records (or grabbing a provider's existing aggregate
associations). This eliminates the need for any join to
provider_aggregates in an INSERT/DELETE statement.

Second, instead of a multi-row INSERT .. SELECT statement, we do
single-shot INSERT ... VALUES statements, one for each added aggregate.

Third, we no longer DELETE all aggregate associations for the provider
in question. Instead, we issue single-shot DELETE statements for only
the aggregates that are being disassociated.

Finally, I've added a number of log debug statements so that we can have
a little more information if this particular patch does not fix the
deadlock issue described in the associated bug.

The method read_tar_image open the image tarfile and read the
manifest.json file inside the tarfile. It used regular expression
to retrieve information from the manifest file. However, the
regular expression cannot handle a corner case that an image
has multiple tags (i.e. cirros:latest and cirros:0.3.4). This
is a reason that our gate failed intermittently.

This commit fixed it. First, use jsonutil to load the manifest
into memory before retrieve information. Second, handle the case
that read_tar_file fails. The container creation should continue
even if it fails to retrieve extra information from the manifest.

load the results was still using testrepository, which is not used

That also exposed another bug in that code path where it was assuming
a repository was created before ostestr was run which is fixed as part

We do not need tox_install.sh, pip can handle constraints itself
and install the project correctly. Thus update tox.ini and remove
the now obsolete tools/tox_install.sh file.

This follows https://review.openstack.org/#/c/508061 to remove
tools/tox_install.sh.

As get-pip.py evolves based on pip 10, while we're still using
pip 9, changes in the way it can be used are causing problems.

For example, the ability to use --download is no longer there.

As such, let's pin to a known good version and leave it at that
until we no longer need to use this script. Version 3.2 maps to
pip 7.1.2 which fulfills our needs.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

When implementing this spec two critical problems were found:
* PXEBoot.validate requires instance image parameters, so we cannot
  use it during inspection.
* PXEBoot.prepare_ramdisk tries to configure DHCP/PXE environment,
  which clashes with inspector's one and requires VIFs to be present.

Additionally, non-obvious heuristic was used to determine which part
should handle boot mode. Ideally, an operator should have a say in it.

This amendment:
* Introduces BootInterface.validate_inspect similar to validate_rescue.
  Modifies PXEBoot.prepare_ramdisk to not configure DHCP for inspection.
* Creates a new ""in-band"" inspect interface instead of changing the
  exising ""inspector"". This allow using the standard options
  enabled_inspect_interfaces/default_inspect_interfaces, as well as
  per-node inspect_interface setting.
* Clarifies our plans and the scope in problem statement.

This is because the file resource doesn't properly handle query
parameters in URLs. So we are forced to use an exec resource here. It's
fine if we always trigger the CRL downloading, as that's a file that
gets udpated often.

Also ensure we get proper escaped source/destination for the download.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the

Inter Tenant Traffic between two different networks that belong
to two different Tenants is not possible when connected through
a shared network that are internally connected through DVR
routers.

This issue can be seen in multinode environment where there
is network isolation.

The issue is, we have two different IP for the ports that are
connecting the two routers and DVR does not expose the router
interfaces outside a compute and is blocked by ovs tunnel bridge
rules.

This patch fixes the issue by not applying the DVR specific
rules in the tunnel-bridge to the shared network ports that
are connecting the routers.

Currently, we cannot get ACCEPT packet log because there are some
changed related to ovs firewall code since ovs firewall logging has
been merged.

Regarding to performance perspective, we only log first accepted packet.

session to table 91 and table 92.

The method read_tar_image open the image tarfile and read the
manifest.json file inside the tarfile. It used regular expression
to retrieve information from the manifest file. However, the
regular expression cannot handle a corner case that an image
has multiple tags (i.e. cirros:latest and cirros:0.3.4). This
is a reason that our gate failed intermittently.

This commit fixed it. First, use jsonutil to load the manifest
into memory before retrieve information. Second, handle the case
that read_tar_file fails. The container creation should continue
even if it fails to retrieve extra information from the manifest.

If a user creates a volume from a snapshot but does not specify a size,
Cinder will default to creating a volume with the same original size
from when the snapshot was created. We had test coverage for the case of
specifying a larger volume size, but not for this default size. This
adds a single test to verify things work as expected without passing in
a value for the new volume size.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.
