Currently the ARA database is not collected after each
test, nor is the reporting done as it should be. This
patch does the following to resolve that:

1. Informs the log collection to collect to and from
   the right source folder.

2. Verifies that the logs directory exists to ensure
   that a missing directory does not cause the job to
   fail.

3. Makes the log collection quiet, so that only errors
   are reported when pulling them back to the zuul
   executor.

4. Removes a layer of indirection by making zuul use
   the scripts library directly instead of working
   through yet another wrapper script.

5. Sets the exit code properly so that the ARA report
   is run on test execution failure.

The magnum source repository unfortunately is not
adhering to the global requirements management process
in that it has requirements specified in the repo which
are not in the global requirements repo.

As a result of the requirement being missing, those
requirements are not constrained by upper-constraints.
That, in turn, causes the repo build to fail to build
the magnum venv due to incompatible requirements.

kubernetes and related dependencies and the release note

Before, while a container was sharding, any misplaced objects
(i.e. updates received since sharding started, for ranges not yet
found) would be merged with the listing from the retired db in an
attempt to give the most up to date listing. However, the merging code
was flawed as it did not respect the data, content-type and metadata
timestamps when merging, but erroneously assumed that all misplaced
objects were newer than those in the retired db.

This patch removes the flawed merge code and consequently listings of
as yet uncleaved ranges will not include recently received updates
that are in the misplaced objects table.

Misplaced objects will be included when cleaving a shard range and will
then appear in the concatenated listing that is constructed by the
proxy server.

Also removes an 'expectedFailure' unit test that covered merging
lists from two dbs.

In ResourceGroup, we (unwisely in retrospect) allow blacklisting of
resources by reference ID (i.e. physical resource ID in most cases). In
order to both determine whether a removal policy entry was an existing
resource name and (if not) to find the resource by physical ID, we would
always load the nested stack into memory.

To avoid this, unconditionally create an output in the nested stack that
returns a mapping of all the resource reference IDs and use it for finding
a resource with a matching reference ID. Only if the output is not
available (because the nested stack hasn't been updated since prior to the
output being defined), fall back to the old way of doing it.

Avoid looking up IDs for names that already appear in the blacklist
(because they were blacklisted in a previous update and have been removed
from the stack.)

Since this is more expensive in time (though hopefully cheaper in space),
update the blacklist only once on resource creation and whenever it
actually changes during an update. This is accomplished by moving the
update to a separate function that is called explicitly, rather than making
it a side-effect of getting the current blacklist (which occurs up to 4
times in each create/update).

This fix addresses the limitation in VirtualBox that you cannot
set the boot device while the node is powered on. Provisioning
of VirtualBox VMs with the pxe_ssh driver will fail because it
attempts to the set the boot device prior to booting the
tenant image.

This fix will detect whether the VirtualBox node is powered on,
and if so will store the target boot device for later
application when the node is next powered on.

There is existing logic controlled by the use_headless option
that addresses this behavior by powering off the node as part of
setting the boot device; however, this approach interferes with
the overall deployment workflow. I have kept this behavior in
place for backward compatibility, but when use_headless is not
set the new logic that stores the boot device is used.

In Ironic standalone mode, deployment kernel and ramdisk images are usually
stored on an external image service like HTTP server.
When iPXE is enabled, nodes can boot from those images directly without
caching them on conductor and serving over conductor's own HTTP server.

This patch adds a new config option `[pxe]ipxe_boot_directly_from` (list
option).
Deployment images with URI's of schemes listed in this option
will not be cached and served locally,
instead iPXE on nodes will attempt to boot from such URIs directly.
Default for this new option is empty list to keep backward compatibility
with current behaviour.

Since Pike we've generated the templates for various nested stack resource
types with outputs that produce the attribute values that are referenced in
the parent stack, and a previous patch did the same for resource IDs. Use
these output values when available to calculate the attribute values. This
is efficient, because the all of the outputs are fetched together and
cached, and avoids using the grouputils functions that cause the nested
stack to get loaded into memory in the same process.

Fall back to the existing implementation (using grouputils) if the required
output isn't available (generally this would be due to the nested stack
being created on an earlier version of Heat that did not include the
outputs in the generated template, and not updated since).

The InstanceGroup and AutoScalingGroup implementations are more complex
than those of ResourceGroup and ResourceChain because they exclude failed
resources at runtime, and also must have a stable sort order for list-type
outputs that cannot be determined at template generation time. Therefore
the underlying output value is always a dict, and the attribute value is
calculated from it.

The magnum source repository unfortunately is not
adhering to the global requirements management process
in that it has requirements specified in the repo which
are not in the global requirements repo.

As a result of the requirement being missing, those
requirements are not constrained by upper-constraints.
That, in turn, causes the repo build to fail to build
the magnum venv due to incompatible requirements.

Given that Ocata is a bit old and we're unlikely to be
able to change the project's behaviour, we implement
our own pins in the repo for the extra dependencies
(both direct and indirect).

The pins we set here are based on the upper-constraints
for pike which do no conflict with the rest of the ocata
libraries.

In the past, we've messed around with enabling or disabling the
yum's fastestmirror plugin. It is helpful if you are running outside
the OpenStack CI system since it will find the fastest mirrors from
a publicly available mirror list.

However, in the CI system, we override the mirror list with a hard-
coded mirror in the `baseurl` line. There's no need to load or use
the fastestmirror plugin in these situations and gathering a list
of mirrors just slows things down.

This patch sets a fact that other roles can check and disable the
fastestmirror plugin when needed.

Based on the observation that a call to sync_routers can be slow
(10-15 seconds for one virtual router), and that profiling data show
that a significant amount of time is spent in function
_get_mtus_by_network_list, this change fixes incorrect the database
query for getting information about networks.

What changed:
- before: SQL query spent time O(#networks in database)
          (select all exists networks from database)
- after : SQL query spent time O(#network_ids passed to the function)
          (select only needed networks)

A basic test shows a drastic improvements, from 2 second to around
~0.2 second, in the processing of a _get_mtus_by_network_list call
with 300 networks in database.

This patch makes the querying of bdms from multiple cells in the
_get_instance_bdms_in_multiple_cells function of extended_volumes use
scatter_gather_cells thus making the process, parallel. It also adds
warnings in case a cell is not available; which the operator can later
tweak, if an exception needs to be raised. So for now, cells that are
not reachable are ignored and it proceeds to the next cell.

The RequestSpec.image object for a volume-backed instance will
not have the 'id' attribute set because the
nova.utils.get_image_metadata_from_volume() method doesn't convert
the volume['volume_image_metadata']['image_id'] into the ImageMeta.id
field. It is unclear if there are intentional reasons for omitting
this information, but the IsolatedHostsFilter has just never supported
filtering for volume-backed instances based on a provided image id.

The logic within the filter depends on the
restrict_isolated_hosts_to_isolated_images config option, which
defaults to True. When True, a volume-backed instance will not be
put on an isolated host. When False, a volume-backed instance can
go on any host, isolated or not.

Again, it's unclear if we should actually be filtering volume-backed
servers using the image_id from the volume_image_metadata or not,
but it's not what we've historically done so this change simply
fixes the regression bug.

more detailed CLI guide on managing volumes, so this change removes

This is a minor version bump for
9adf97c0132c3e0d34bbb2e33b59c6e5b00bec57 which
adds an optional db schema migration. The minor
version bump is an indication to deployment tooling
that they should run the db schema migrations (even
though those are free and tooling should be running
them on upgrade regardless, but I digress).

Now that we have system scope in place, we should make sure at least
one user has a role assignment on the system. We can do this at the
same time we grant the user a role on a project during bootstrap.

This is backwards compatible because even if a deployment doesn't use
system-scope, the assignment will just sit there. The deployment will
have to opt into enforcing scope by updating configuration options
for oslo.policy to enforce scoping.

This shouldn't prevent deployments from fixing bug 968696 and using
system scope.

This commit removes system role assignments when querying keystone

`GET /v3/role_assignments?role.id={role_id}`, now returns assignments
only for that role. Previously, the list contained false positives
because some system role assignments weren't being removed. This
was introduced in queens with the system scope work.

Python logging is pretty amazingly flexible, and allows us to emit
to arbitrary logging domains so that a consumer can direct log output
with specificity.

Turning on HTTP debug logging currently produces an avalanche of output,
when sometimes just seeing that the requests were made and responded to
is perfectly fine.

Split the loggers used into four - one for request ids, one for request
commands, one for response headers and one for response body content.
Make them subloggers of keystoneauth.session so that if a user does nothing,
their existing logging config will be unchanged.

If someone passes in a logger, behave as before logging all things to
the provided logger.

While we're at it, document this in the using-sessions document, so that
people know that the loggers exist and what they do.

NOTE:
The tox (>=1.7.0) by default sets a random python hash seed which
causes ordering of dicts and sets to be different between tests runs.
Disabled the random python hash seed by setting PYTHONHASHSEED=0 to
fix the random failure of below test:

keystoneauth1.tests.unit.test_session.SessionAuthTests.
test_split_loggers

The PYTHONHASHSEED=0 is removed in the followup patch so that we can
separate the tracking down of ordering issues in tests from this patch.

Using Puppet stdlib in TripleO is risky because it exposes deployments
to dependency cycles in the catalog.
We should rather use native functions to make orchestrations, like
ordering and dependencies management.

This patch:

- removes usage of stages from stdlib
- use ordering to make sure we run pre rules before post
- use ordering to make sure we start all Services in catalog before post
  rules. It ensure that we don't drop all traffic before starting the
  services, which could lead to services errors (e.g. trying to reach database
  or amqp)

Remove 'connect_timeout' which defined in the '[client]' section which
surprisingly affects mysqldump by causing it to fail as it doesn't
understand this; we're not doing anything that depends on having this
value so this is safe.

This now means mysqldump works (as expected) and we can use the

Wires in the use of ../network/ports/external_from_pool.yaml
so that we can control the named 'public_virtual_ip' created in
overcloud.yaml when using Undercloud SSL.

By default this has previously gone to the ctlplane IP for the
Undercloud itself. When SSL is enabled we want it set to a different
VIP managed by Haproxy/keepalived. If SSL is disabled
python-tripleoclient just sets it to the ctlplane so the previous
behavior is preserved.

Each service has a set of Resources which define the fundamental
qualities of the remote resources. Because of this, a large portion
of the methods on Proxy classes are (or can be) boilerplate.

Add a metaclass (two in a row!) that reads the definition of the
Proxy class and looks for Resource classes attached to it. It then checks
them to see which operations are allowed by looking at the Resource's
allow_ flags. Based on that, it generates the standard methods and doc
strings from a template and adds them to the class.

If a method exists on the class when it is read, the generated method
does not overwrite the existing method. Instead, it is attached as
``_generated_{method_name}``. This allows people to either write
specific proxy methods and completely ignore the generated method,
or to write specialized methods that then delegate action to the generated
method.

Since this is done as a metaclass at class object creation time,
things like sphinx continue to work.

One of the results of this is the addition of a reference to each
resource class on the proxy object. I've wanted one of those before (I
don't remember right now why I wanted it)

This makes a change to just a few methods/resources in Server as an
example of impact. If we like it we can go through and remove all of the
boilerplate methods and leave only methods that are special.

openstack.compute.v2._proxy.Proxy.servers is left in place largely
because it has a special doc string. I think we could (and should)
update the generation to look at the query parameters to find and
document in the docstring for list methods what the supported parameters
are.

This stems from some thinking we had in shade about being able to
generate most of the methods that fit the pattern. It's likely we'll
want to do that for shade methods as well - but we should actually be
able to piggyback shade methods on top of the proxy methods, or at least
use a similar approach to reduce most of the boilerplate in the shade
layer.

The base resource class is ""Resource"" but the base proxy class is
""BaseProxy"" which makes reading the docs a bit strange. It was
originally not really a big real because nothing used Proxy directly.
But since we add Proxy instances to the Connection for every service in
service-types-authority which are now documented as part of the
Connection object, calling them BaseProxy is a bit weird.

Keep a BaseProxy object around so we don't break out of tree Proxy
objects, but add a deprecation to it so people can update.

Shift BaseProxy from the main user docs to the contributor layout docs.
Add showing inheritance, as well as docs for OpenStackSDKAdapter.

However, in the CI system, we override the mirror list with a hard-
coded mirror in the `baseurl` line. There's no need to load or use
the fastestmirror plugin in these situations and gathering a list
of mirrors just slows things down.

This patch sets a fact that other roles can check and disable the
fastestmirror plugin when needed.

Instead of dealing with some decidated functions in Update/upgrade

inherit the update class from the DeployCommand class will allow the

and all the tips and tricks that the deploy class does for handling

The task that moves the aide database checks to see whether aide
was just initialized, but that task has a ""changed_when: false"" to
help with idempotency. That means that the database never gets
moved into place.

This patch changes the task to check whether the aide
initialization was skipped or not. If it wasn't skipped, then the
database will be moved.

Ansible 2.4+ suffers from a precedence bug when including tasks in
roles. It appears that a file in a relative tasks/ path inside the
current working directory is preferred over an identical file
from the role itself. For example:

task path: /home/zuul/.ansible/roles/previous_galera_server/tasks/galera_install.yml:20
included: /home/zuul/src/git.openstack.org/openstack/openstack-ansible-galera_server/tasks/galera_install_apt.yml for container1

As one can see, instead of including the galera_install_apt.yml from the
/home/zuul/.ansible/roles/previous_galera_server/tasks/ directory, the
one which is relative to the current working directory
(/home/zuul/src/git.openstack.org/openstack/openstack-ansible-galera_server/)
is preferred. We can simply workaround that by entering a different
directory which doesn't look like a role directory structure before executing
that part of the upgrade job.

The task that moves the aide database checks to see whether aide
was just initialized, but that task has a ""changed_when: false"" to
help with idempotency. That means that the database never gets
moved into place.

This patch changes the task to check whether the aide
initialization was skipped or not. If it wasn't skipped, then the
database will be moved.

Currently there is no way to have DHCP agents not announce DNS servers
for a subnet. The current behaviour when the dns_nameservers option is
set to '0.0.0.0' is that each agent will only announce itself instead of
announcing the list of all dhcp agents for that subnet, which seems not
too useful. So we redefine the meaning of this option to instruct the
DHCP agent to not announce any DNS server in that case.

Actually, going back to square one, it would be more natural to swap the
meaning of ""option unset"" and ""option 0.0.0.0"", but that would change
the default behaviour for all existing installation and thus does not
seem feasible.

The qpress library is only needed for xtrabackup compression. The
compression only occurs when a new node is joining the cluster
which shouldn't happen very often. The variable is set to true only
when the architecture is x86_64 since that's the only arch that's
supported by the upstream repository and CentOS and Ubuntu do not
provide qpress in the downstream distributions at all.

These calls are subject to transient network problems, we should
not abort ironic-inspector process in this case. Also due to
bug 1748893 the port listing API can sometimes return HTTP 400.

This change retries port listing 5 times with 1 second break
before aborting the periodic task and thus the process.

This change introduces a dependency on the retrying library,
which is already widely used in OpenStack (including ironic).

When container prep images invoked for non dockerish env files,
like '-e mytht/environments/services/legacy.yaml', which refers
to some 'puppet/legacy.yaml' deployed on the host,
it omits that service and does not generate parameters
for the containerized service image.

On stable/newton, if you reboot an AIO the nova-conductor and
nova-api-metadata services start at the same time, and it appears that
nova-conductor needs to be up first before nova-api-metadata starts.
When this isn't the case, the nova-api-metadata service eventually
times out (cleanly), and requires a manual start/restart to bring it
online.

This commit simply gives the nova-conductor containers a start order of
39, and the remaining nova containers a start order of 49. This ensures
that nova-conductor starts before nova-api-metadata comes up.

Now to perform some action mistral gets its definition from
the database first. It's not really optimal, because if there are
a lot of similar action calls, mistral will reread the same data
from db. It increases the whole execution time and the load on the
database.

To improve the performance it's suggested to cache read definitions
and take them from the cache instead of the database in the subsequent
times.

Cache ttl can be configured with ``action_definition_cache_time``
option from [engine] group. The default value is 60 seconds.

These calls are subject to transient network problems, we should
not abort ironic-inspector process in this case. Also due to
bug 1748893 the port listing API can sometimes return HTTP 400.

This change retries port listing 5 times with 1 second break
before aborting the periodic task and thus the process.

This change introduces a dependency on the retrying library,
which is already widely used in OpenStack (including ironic).
