1024Mb memory is too much for single instance.
approximately 4 GiB memory used even without a booted VM.

The heat auto-scaling scenario needs to boot 3 VM
(currently disabled), if any other test running in parallel
and boots up a vm it would easily can cause OOM an
issue.

The heat-slow job can work with 128 MiB instance memory,
but this change reduces it just to 512 MiB (safer for the guest),
and enough to avoid OOM issues on the host,
and let us to heve more vm at the same time.

The m1.tiny flavor is not good because now it has a hard coded
1 GiB disk limit and the f20 image requires 2 GiB.
Setting the disk size to '0' -> automatically use the virtual size
of the image.

Using multiple cores does not really helps in boot time :(,
but it might cause higher host load. (More locking)
Reducing the core number to 1.

Adds logic to the update_port_postcommit method of the
Big Switch ML2 driver to detect when afailure to update
the port via REST was caused by the backend being out-of-sync
with neutron.

This was accomplished by checking for the NXNETWORK message
which indicates that a port request referenced a network that
does not exist on the backend. This only occurs when they are
out-of-sync so the driver will then trigger a full topology sync.

The same logic exists in the port creation method shared with
the Big Switch plugin. However, the Big Switch ML2 driver does
not send port requests to the controller unless the port binding
host ID is set, which doesn't occur until a port update after
binding in the ML2 scenario. Therefore, the logic has to be repeated
in the ML2 driver port update operation.

This is the last in a series of patches to prepare Ironic for the
removal of capabilities in Nova HostManager.

IronicHostManager used to rely on capabilities info to decide which
host state class to use, VM or baremetal. This has been broken since
host capabilities reporting were removed in Nova, resulting in Nova
HostState class always being used.

This patch fixes the detection logic in IronicHostManager to correctly
choose IronicHostState class for use with baremetal nodes. Tests are
added to verify that the correct class is used for both vm and
baremetal nodes.

In reality, the new detection logic will not start to deliver the
correct HostState class until the Nova HostManager change has landed.

When auth_token stores the token in the cache, it's stored with
the expiration time; but when the token is retrieved from the
cache, if the expiration time has passed the token is treated as if
it wasn't cached. This creates extra work because now auth_token
has to check the token expiration (either by decrypting the PKI
token or online validation for UUID tokens).

With this change, getting the token from the cache will fail if the
expiration is past.

Tempest doesn't have enough Cinder v2 api tests. We need to add more
tests for it. Cinder v2 api only has some small updates, so v1 and v2
tests could share service client and test code.
This patch makes the follwoing initial chanages to support sharing
codes between v1 and v2:

1. Rename volumes v1 client to a base client, then create v1 and v2
   clients inheriting base client.
2. Create common base test class instead of
   BaseVolumeV1Test/BaseVolumeV2Test. They will be remove after all
   test classes using sharing codes.

The find_resource method had two hacks in in to support cinder

for cinder.

The find_resource method used to attempt to UUID parse the id, but
it would do a manager.get anyway.  I changed it to skip the UUID
parsing.  This will make things run minorly faster and it supports
LDAP for keystone.

The find_resource used to attempt to use display_name=name_or_id
when finding.  This was a hack for cinder support, but it breaks
keystone because keystone totally messes up with the bogus filter
and keystone refuses to fix it.

This patch defines the last missing dependencies between the different
parts that make up a RADOS cluster.

The entire module should now have sane dependencies and except where
explicitely wanted, the integration tests should not need to specify
them anymore and have been updated appropriately.

Here is an overview of the dependencies:

When installing:
* packages:
  * need the repositories
* configuration (ceph_config):
  * needs the packages, so the base folder exists
* ceph::mon:
  * needs all configuration (ceph_config) to be done
* ceph::key:
  * needs the binaries (package)
  * if injecting configuration needs to be available (to find the
    address of the monitor)
  * if injecting needs the monitor to be available
* ceph::osd:
  * needs all configuration (ceph_config) to be done
  * needs monitors in the same cluster to be running
  * needs keys in the same cluster to be installed
* ceph::pool:
  * needs all configuration (ceph_config) to be done
  * needs monitors to be running
  * needs keys to be installed

When removing:
* ceph::mon:
  * needs the binaries (package) still around
* ceph::osd:
  * needs the monitors in the same cluster to still be available
* ceph::pool:
  * needs the monitors to still be available

removal of capabilities in Nova HostManager.

IronicHostManager used to rely on capabilities info to decide which
host state class to use, VM or baremetal. This has been broken since
host capabilities reporting were removed in Nova, resulting in Nova
HostState class always being used.

Before IronicNodeState class can be used again, it must be updated to
store host stats as this is needed by ComputeCapabilitiesFilter to
correctly filter hosts or this filter will return no hosts.

Since merge_config_file() tries to create an unsubstituted config file,
stack.sh fails due to permission denied in the file creation when you
use '[[post-config|/$Q_PLUGIN_CONF_FILE]]' and the file does not exist.

This patch deletes unnecessary 'touch' command, because the file will
be made by 'iniset' function in the next command line with evaled
string from 'configfile'.

This patch also fixes merge_config_group() to use evaled 'configfile'
when it checks the directory of the config file exists.

It sources configuration files and libraries, parses options and
arguments, and calls library functions to get the work done.

If a VM cluster was built (rather than just a basedisk), it can
export an OVA package containing the cluster.

This is the first in a series of patches to prepare Ironic for the
removal of capabilities in Nova HostManager.

IronicHostManager used to rely on capabilities info to decide which
host state class to use, VM or baremetal. This has been broken since
host capabilities reporting were removed in Nova, resulting in Nova
HostState class always being used.

IronicBareMetal tests make use of an internal Nova HostManager variable
in a way that hides the fact that IronicNodeState class is no longer
used. This patch rewrites tests to better reflect how Ironic/Nova code
now works and prepares for further changes that needs to land in Ironic
before Nova HostManager capabilities can be removed.

OpenStack install-guide for Icehouse/Ubuntu.

It installs the MySQL server package and the Python library, sets the
database root password as configured in the credentials config file,
and edits my.cnf as described in the manual. -- This part shows how
devstack functions can be used to edit configuration files.

Note that mysql_secure_installation (from the manual) is not called

it into the version of MySQL that is in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

This changeset adds two simple helper scripts.

base_fixups.sh is run on every basedisk while it is built. The script
can be used to fix whatever is necessary to make the basedisk work.
Right now, all it does is remove 70-persistent-net.rules which (if left
untouched) would result in a network interface order that would differ
from Vagrant's.

The second script is a trivial debug helper that does nothing but wait
for the removal of a file it creates in /tmp. When the file is removed,
execution continues.

The training-guides tox.ini was inherited from openstack-manuals
which merges static content from its www directory into its
publish-docs folder.

training-guides doesn't have a www directory -- it shares the static
content with openstack-manuals (they both publish into the same web
root).

Trying to copy files from a non-existent directory results in failure
which in turn prevents training-guides from publishing its manual.

This patch removes from tox.ini the commands that try to copy the
content of the www directory.

(such as replacing gettaddr with a version that doesn't support

it doesn't get imported when it's not needed, such as when

The environment module will be configured once, during code initialization.
Subsequently all other possibly-evented modules will retrieve from

library modules.

If eventlet, httplib, subprocess or other environment dependant module
is referenced outside of the environment module it should be considered
a bug.

The changes to tests are required to ensure that test is imported first
to setup the environment. Hopefully these can all be replaced with an

I made an attempt in e743158e7a61c00e2a32c340d3f268d0835f4c69 to not
include resource metadata when listing resources in the RPC API. Probably
due to a merge conflict, this was unsuccessful (although it did have the
effect of doubling the number of times we refreshed it from the database).

Neither the cfn API nor the native API passes on the metadata information
from list_stack_resources, so it is safe to remove this from the RPC API
for that call (which is the only one that passes detail=False) without
affecting the user-facing APIs.

This commit updates the jsonschema validation method validate_response()
to use the rest client method expected_success() to check that the
correct status code response is received. Previously validate response
was doing the same check despite there already being a method available
for doing the check. As a part of using expected_success() to validate
the status codes using the jsonschema it was necessary to expand
expected_successs() to handle both single expected codes as well as a
list of codes. This is because it's perfectly valid for the jsonschema
to specify a list of expected responses.

Some Nova API calls require synchronous use of cinder.  (e.g. volume
list)  If the call to cinder lands on a slow performing or otherwise bad
cinder API node, the user of Nova API will see poor performance.

This patch adds the ability to control HTTP timeouts when calling the
cinder API.  By configuring a timeout, nova will be able to more quickly
retry its cinder request and hopefully land on a better performing
cinder API node.  This will help make the API response times more
predictable.

For backward compatibility, the default timeout value is None.

This commit switches the default value for the nova v3 api config
option from true to false. This changes the default behavior to not
run the Nova v3 API tests. This is because the v3 is still marked as
experimental and is able to change in a non-backwards compatible way
which will cause issues when running with branchless tempest.
Additionally, the nova team decided not to do a standalone v3 api so
at some point this will disappear and instead become v2.1 of the api
with microversions. When you couple this with the fact that tempest's
gate budget is basically exhausted (tests shouldn't take over an hour
to run in the gate) this should be defaulted off. For more discussion
see:

This sync change Id82090743e8b93f6c960de066fd05d8a2f9fb934 from
oslo-incubator

Opportunistic db test cases create schemas on demand, so that each
test case which inherits the base test case class, will get its own
db schema (i. e. races between tests are not possible).

In order to do schema provisioning we have to connect to RDBMS server
first. So far we've been connecting to the openstack_citest database,
which is guaranteed to exist on CI nodes. It turns out, there are a
few test cases in Nova (maybe in other projects as well), that drop
and recreate the openstack_citest database. If they happen to do that
when the opportunistic db fixture is in the middle of provisioning a
schema, those tests will fail (as there is an open session to the
database and thus it can't be dropped).

This can be solved easily by changing the way we provision new
schemas in opportunistic db test cases as actually, we don't have to
connect to the openstack_citest database at all:

 - for MySQL we can use an empty db name to connect to MySQL server,
   but not to a particular database
 - PostgreSQL requires us to specify the database name. We can use
   the service postgres database here (PostgreSQL shell utils such
   as createdb, createuser, etc use it for the very same reason)

This change adds the ability to do so.  Each Theory class
now has the following functions.
o  policy(): returns any policy statements the theory represents
o  contents(): returns any policy or data the theory represents
o  __str__(): prints the theory in a form that can be parsed.
Different subclasses of Theory differ in whether they print
policy() or contents().

The Runtime class includes functions for loading/dumping
a particular file into a particular theory and for loading/dumping
all policies into a directory where each policy corresponds
to a file with the same name.

Commit a141206e9dfd31955b9b31d9e5a7f73bbd8510ca ensured that user defined
ports were not deleted when an instance is deleted or rescheduled. The
problem with this commit is that it did not reset the 'device_id' and
'device_owner' of the port. This leads to port leakage and eventually a tenant
is unable to launch any instances as their port quota has exceeded the
allocated amount.

The solution is for the deallocation to reset the 'device_id' and the
'device_owner' of the port. This is allocated when the port is actually assigned
to an instance.

In the case of minesweeper (which runs on OpenStack), the tenant was leaking ports.
The root cause was that the user defined ports were assigned to a specific instance,
which was deleted, as a result of a failed reschedule (which is legitimate).

When an instance is deleted all artificats of that instance should be reset on the
port.

Note that while Vagrant calls run_scripts.sh through symlinks named
after the nodes (controller.sh, network.sh, compute.sh), this has no
effect because run_scripts.sh relies on the hostname to select the
configuration.

The symlinks (and the Vagrantfile section that calls them) can be removed

scripts for Vagrant on the host-side.

this ensures that all the services we believe are enabled in the
new environment are actually started after we have come up on the
new side. It does couple us to the devstack service list in a way
that we weren't before, however that's probably a long term useful
place to be.

This should make the discovery of failed started services a lot
more reliable.

Remove old `service_check` as that only failed if there was a
failure file, and not if the service never started up in bash.

The complexity of the awk script was pretty high, and it would
be good to do it in summaries as well, which starts to get a bit
squirelly. Instead bring over the outfilter.py from grenade and
use it for the timestamping.

Any additional overhead from python should be offset from not
shelling out to date on every line of output.

HP Cloud 1.1 is quite slow per core. So much so that grenade is
often failing to start services because bash in a screen session
isn't ready in 1.5s. Double this to 3s to try to decrease failures

We should instead do this via some readiness check to decrease

it to point to a settings file that does not use keystone v3, which
is expected by the tests (and is the source of the warning).  Note that
when running unit tests via run_tests.sh, a different settings file is
supplied which DOES use keystone v3.

DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to the same settings file used by the unit tests,

get_meta_section_files has an implied API of returning each
config-file that is affected by a meta-section command on a new-line.
Thus it should be expanding any variables it might find before
returning them, for example

 [[post-config|/$Q_PLUGIN_CONF_FILE]]

To facilitate this, run eval() over the filename to expand it fully.
Unfortunately, eval() seems like the only option without starting to
replicate the semantics of eval itself.  Nothing implies that the
file-name should start $ if it is a variable (see counter example
above), or N variables ($TOP_DIR/$CONFIG/$FILE...) isn't valid, etc.

A test-case is added to test_config.sh

This change enables autostart functionality for osbash.

activate_autostart is called by a minimal script written by
preseed/kickstart files (if configured).

It creates (and grants sudo privileges to) the osbash user if
that has not been done by preseed/kickstart.

It uses template-osbashauto to generate /etc/init.d/osbashauto and
configures the system to run the script immediately and during every
subsequent system boot.

osbashauto iterates over all files in the autostart directory (in the
VirtualBox shared folder; filled by osbash from the host side) and
executes them as the osbash user. It writes its log files into the log
directory in the shared folder.

The standard way of running services in screen windows
is the

$ cd $<SERVICE>_DIR && <SERVICE_CMD> --config-file $<SERVICE>_CONF

In case of the m-shr window (manila-share service) this was prefixed
with some initialization command to work around some initialization
context issues.

That's not required anymore, as those were specific to the lvm
driver, and now Manila is configured with lvm as default.
(If someone wishes to use lvm s/he can be referred to the cinder-volume
service which exhibits an issue analogous to that of Manila's lvm).

So we can go back to the standard format.

Currently we have a situation where if an instance fails to delete,
instead of having its state reverted, like we do in most places we set
it to error,deleting. This was intentionally done in
I5fb1bbd56035792f566a6e076edfe7a69df006ef. We also intentionally ignore
duplicate requests to delete an instance if its already being deleted
(I2f97f93bd714e0ea3b6d4fa3ac457ab43eed00e1). The combination of these two
things means that if an instance fails to delete for some reason a
tenant is unable to delete that instance.

It turns out this is really bad because instances in deleting state
count against quota, so the tenant slowly looses usable quota.

To fix this, upon a failed termination set the vm_state to error and
revert the task_state. This is a partial revert of

We store only the exception from the last host error, it will

This reverts commit 6478554f531f6ee2fa86226fbc79dd31e556bc06.

This API change merged as a bug fix and introduced bugs and our API
change policy is more or less to go through the blueprint/nova-specs
review process:

http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2014-June/037536.html

So reverting this so it can go through the blueprint/nova-specs
review process.

There should be minimal impacts to removing this (broken) API since
it merged not too long ago and was added strictly for Ceilometer's
usage, not an external deployer that would be (more) broken by this
API removal.

The python-ldap API only accepts UTF-8 encoded strings therefore any
unicode values must be encoded to UTF-8 prior to passing to
python-ldap and conversely UTF-8 encoded strings returned from
python-ldap need to be decoded back from UTF-8 into unicode.

Need to use unicode() rather than str() to properly handle non-ascii
characters, but to be PY2/PY3 compatible use six.text_type.

Very few of the ldap tests were using non-ascii values, in fact
non-ascii values were restricted to only specific tests that
had 'unicode' in their test name. This is very weak test coverage.
Replace all occurances of 'fake', the standard string
used in the tests for test value with 'fäké' where the a has an
umlaut and the e has a diacritical. Visually they look almost the
same but will trigger the type of encoding exceptions we've seen
in the past.

Currently glanceclient's v2 commands don't support modification
operations on an image's location attribute - the argparse specification
for the location attribute of the image-update command causes the image
id argument to be included in list of locations and so the command
parsing fails (because it causes the image id to appear to be missing).

Furthermore even if the 'locations' argument were to be accepted by
argparse (e.g. by changing the argument specs and using --id to specify
the image id) the command would still fail because the arguments are
passed directly to the schema which expects the value of the 'locations'
argument to be a valid dictionary (there is nobody to convert the
argument string to a python dictionary that the schema expects).

This commit adds the following location related commands to
glanceclient:
    --location-add: Add a new location to the list of image locations.
    --location-delete: Remove an existing location from the list of
        image locations.
    --location-update: Update the metadata of existing location.

The glanceclient.v2.images.Controller class has been agumented with
three new methods to support the commands listed above:
    - add_location
    - delete_locations
    - update_location

The server has not been modified, i.e. all location related API requests
are passed to the server via HTTP PATCH requests and handled by the
server's image update function.

The v2 'image' and 'shell' related tests have also been supplemented.

Note that in order to use these options the server must be first
configured to expose location related info to the clients (i.e.
'show_multiple_locations' must be set to 'True"").

I also added a mailmap entry for myself.

This changeset adds a library of functions for interacting with
VirtualBox via VBoxManage. It contains functions for creating and
booting VMs, taking snapshots, configuring disks, networking, and
shared folders.

In addition, its vm_attach_guestadd-iso can ask VirtualBox for the
guest-additions ISO and, if that fails, look for it on the local
filesystem or download the correct version from virtualbox.org. On
Windows (wbatch), the function relies on VirtualBox providing the
guest-additions ISO (which on that platform appears to be a safe bet).

When there is a bridge configuration in the interfaces definition the
openvswitch-switch service needs to be started early.

This ensures that the metadata server is available for cloud-init when
it runs.

Refactor image create and set commands to properly handle properties.
This is particularly tricky with exclusive booleans as in this case leaving
both choices off the command line should NOT assume a default value but
leave the existing value unchanged.

Properties were not being updated correctly in the 'image set' command.
Refactor it to use the same pattern as in other SetXxx commands.
Add tests for arg handling.

On Nova API, we can see two names for each API extension. The one is
""Name"", the other is ""Alias"". The ""Name"" is represented with camelcase
and the ""Alias"" is done with characters and hyphens:

 $ nova list-extensions
 +--------------+-----------------------+------------------+---------+
 | Name         | Summary               | Alias            | Updated |
 +--------------+-----------------------+------------------+---------+
 | AdminActions | Enable admin-only ... | os-admin-actions | ...     |
 | Agents       | Agents support.       | os-agents        | ...     |
 | ConsoleOutput| Console log output... | os-console-output| ...     |
 | Consoles     | Interactive Console.. | os-consoles      | ...     |

In Tempest, we can select API extensions what we test and it should be
based on ""Alias"", because on Nova side we have been a lot stricter about
format/uniqueness for the alias which is seen as the canonical name.
This patch clarifies it.

During cloud-init there are several calls that asks neutron API for the
same data which will not be most likely changed. Specifically router's
networks are cached.

Decorator caches methods' results, the key is composed from function
name and its parameters. Implementation of cache itself should be in
object implementing decorated method. Cache backend should be taken
from oslo-incubator.
