Sometimes a vm gets its tap interface unset and reset too fast to be caught in
an agent loop, and its vlan tag was not reset.

We now detect if an interface loses its vlan tag, and if it happens the
interface will be reconfigured.

Since the TAG ID is only available via the ""Port"" table (in the 'tag' column),
we couldn't reuse the get_vif_port_set() method's run_vsctl call which queries
the ""Interface"" table, and needed a specific run_vsct call to the ""Port"" table
in the new get_port_tag_dict() method.

When a ProcessExecutionError is thrown by processutils.execute(), the
exception may contain information such as password. Upstream
applications that just log the message (as several appear to do) could
inadvertently expose these passwords to a user with read access to the
log files. It is therefore considered prudent to invoke
strutils.mask_password() on the command, stdout and stderr in the
exception.

Currently BatchAction proposes only an action_present and action_past verb
to be concatenated with a data_type_singular or data_type_plural string.

The issue is that many languages need to conjugate the verb with the
plural/singular subject, and some translations where terribly awfull and
impossible to do.
Indeed, some languages have up to 5 plural forms depending on the number of
items.

This patch introduces the fact that action_present is a method instead of an
attribute, which in conjonction with https://review.openstack.org/57701 allows
better translation to be performed.

This patch also adds contextual mrkers to STATUS_DISPLAY_CHOICES,
TASK_DISPLAY_CHOICES and POWER_DISPLAY_CHOICES because it was impossible to
translate the stand-alone words out of context for a translator (i.e. the word
""active"" will be translated differently if the active object is feminine or
masculine, since feminine and masculine depends also on the language, it is
mission impossible for the translator to translate ""active"" if he does not know
""what"" is ""active"").

It is important to use unicode strings with contextual markers because of the
following django bug:
https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22565
The django community was very quick and responsive and fixed the bug very fast:
https://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/142c27218a0bb07bb197faab7b1d8eb3a084f5b9
and back-ported their fix in the 1.6 and 1.7 django branches:
https://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/61fd00d4fd65f44d0a05be4c7e95124e4102ec27
https://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/034866204b39f797c73997b03cd90443aa03aa91
but since in horizon we support back to django 1.4, we will have to live with
it by providing unicode strings until we drop support of old django versions.

We can't introduce contextual markers and ungettext (pluralization) verywhere
at once because Translators would totally loose their previous work. So we have
to progressively introduce contextual markers and pluralization, when a string
is changed, or for new strings. It is also the reason why this patch changes
only the strings of the instance view actions.

Since we can't use contextual markers and pluralization for all the code at
once, this patch partially:

This patch extends the queues operation supported by the CLI.
It also renames some of the previously added features to make
them more consistent with their behaviour.

Features added:
- Check queue existence
- Set queue metadata
- Get queue metadata
- Get queue stats

Some examples:
	$ openstack queue exists myqueue
	$ openstack queue set metadata myqueue
	$ openstack queue stats myqueue

The above assumes Keystone is installed and has an endpoint
configured for Marconi. In order to bypass this in a non-Keystone
based deployment, the user can pass Marconi's url manually:

    $  openstack --os-token test
                 --os-url http://127.0.0.1:8888
		 queue exists myqueue

Server groups can be used to control the affinity and anti-affinity
scheduling policy for a group of servers (instances).  Whilst this is
a useful mechanism for users such scheduling decisions need to be
balanced by a deployers requirements to make effective use of the
available capacity.

This change adds quota values to constrain the number and size of
server groups a user can create.

Two new quota values are be introduced to limit the number of server
groups and the number of servers in a server group. These will follow
the existing pattern for quotas in that:

* They are defined by config values, which also include the default
  value

* They can be defined per project or per user within a project

* A value of -1 for either quota will be treated as unlimited

* Defaults can be set via the quota groups API

* Values may be changed at any time but will only take effect at the next
  server group or server create.   Reducing the quota will not affect any
  existing groups, but new servers will not be allowed into group
  that have become over quota.

This is part one of a linked sequences of changes that implement the
new quotas - split to make the reviews easier.

This part adds the definition of the new quota values, but leaves the
V2 API unchanged.  The V2.1 API is updated as it shows all quota values.

The second part adds the new V2 API extension to make the new quota
values visible and changeable.  At this point a Tempest change is
required to get a clean run as it checks for a specific set of
values.

The third part implements the quota checks themselves.

Thanks to Cyril Roelandt for supplying some of the unit tests.

With swift rings, a ""min_part_hours"" value is required. This is the
time (in hours) before a specific partition can be moved in succession
(following a rebalance). Currently this value is hard-coded to 1 but
this value is not feasible for a large system and it can often take
several hours for partitions to re-align following a rebalance.

Therefore, this change allows this value to be configurable by adding
the ""MIN_PART_HOURS"" variable. If this change is accepted, I will add
the relevant parameter in tripleo-heat-templates.

I've noticed several people asking questions about the arbitrary usage
of ['1.1'] in code review, so I figured I'd refactor them into a
constant so it's a bit more self-documenting, since it's definition is,
in fact, completely arbitrary:

    If the client does not want any attributes returned, it can specify
    a list containing only the attribute with OID ""1.1"". This OID was
    chosen arbitrarily and does not correspond to any attribute in use.

Sometimes a datatable needs to be displayed slightly differently, for
instance with or without the borders, condensed, zebra, etc. This patch
lets us do that in two ways.

It adds a css_class option to table's Meta, so that we can easily add
more classes to a particular table, and modify its looks with CSS.

It also puts the whole table's CSS class list in a block, so that we
can inherit from the table's template to completely replace its classes,
if we need to.

to avoid calling it more than once, especially, when it doesn't add

The old logging statements in lockutils made for some confusing log
entries where it would appear a given lock was acquired multiple
times by different threads at the same time.  See referenced bug
for details.

In order to alleviate that confusion, this change does a few things:
1) Adds an explicit ""acquired"" message inside the lock so it is
   clear when the lock was actually acquired.
2) Moves the release message inside the semaphore so there's no
   chance of it being logged out of order.
3) Removes the ""Got semaphore"" message and splits it into two
   separate messages depending on whether the semaphore was found
   in the weakref dictionary.  Making it clear which code path
   was followed should help with future debugging.

This is the incubator port of olso.concurrency change

perhaps get some better information to debug with when a timeout
actually occurs for bug #1357578.

Renames the _terminate_workers() method to _wait_for_workers_to_end(),
as that accurately describes what that method was really doing, and adds
a new _terminate_workers() method to actually stop the
workers (used in tearDown() when the test_restart_sighup() method does
not actually stop the API worker processes like the other test methods
do).

This patch further reorganizes ProvisionedDatabase
such that it now can maintain a single ProvisionedDatabase
instance across a named ""scope"".  A ""scope"" refers
to a series of test runs which can all safely share the
same database schema as well as optional fixture data.

When a test specifies a non-None ""scope"", the test
is run within a special context that redirects
engine and connection use to a new series of objects
based on a hierarchy called NonCommittingConnectable.
This object produces a facade that behaves like
SQLAlchemy Engine, Connection and Transaction objects
to the degree necessary for a typical database round-trip
test, but ensures that all operations run within a
single transaction that is never committed.   To allow
tests to do real rollbacks, savepoints are used, and the
transaction container always maintains a savepoint
as well for this purpose.

As tests run, if each successive test indicates the
same ""scope"" as the previous, the database is not dropped,
and the same schema is re-used; all changes to this schema
since the last test ran will have been rolled back.

When a change in scope occurs between tests, the
""drop all objects"" routine is run, again so that the
database is not actually dropped, but is instead cleared
of all objects built within it.

Currently, the behavior of ProvisionedDatabase
as a persistent object between tests is only meaningful within
the span of a testr run that calls upon the
testr ""instance_execute"" and related hooks.  If these
hooks are not called, such as if the tests are run
via a different test runner, or from testtools directly,
there is currently no way for the
provisioning system to have an indication to drop
databases when all tests are complete, so without
instance_execute setting up OSLO_SCHEMA_TOKEN, the
old behavior of dropping the named database after
each test still takes place.  The ProvisionedDatabase
instance ties its own lifecycle to that of the named database
which it creates; so when dropping the database, the
ProvisionedDatabase itself removes it from the lookup.
On the next lookup for that type of database, a new
ProvisionedDatabase will replace it.

The default scope for any test is None, which
indicates that the scoping feature is not used for
those tests.  However, assuming testr has specified
OSLO_SCHEMA_TOKEN, the ProvisionedDatabase instance is now
persistent across runs for these tests as well, but at
the end of each test it now runs the ""drop all objects""
routine, rather than dropping the whole database.

openstack%2Foslo.db~master~Ibaaefcef2678cc5b985e7c00f05f91b6f02de3f8,openstack/oslo.db,master,bug/1339206,Ibaaefcef2678cc5b985e7c00f05f91b6f02de3f8,Add support for per-test-run database provisioning,ABANDONED,2014-07-29 22:36:00.000000000,2014-09-11 18:21:55.000000000,,87,36,9,110486,2e73b28a3747002bb60bd2bc5519f1b53045dfaa,105,10,24,3,11816,mike_mp@zzzcomputing.com,zzzeek,"Add support for per-test-run database provisioning

A key aspect of being able to use so-called ""tranasctional""
testing, that is, testing where the same schema is maintained
across many tests, and data created by the tests is
kept within a non-persistent transaction, is that a single
database node be made available for the duration of many
tests.   The issue that has occurred with this approach
however is that when the tests are run using
multiple, concurrent processes, the concurrent tests
conflict and lock against each other if they are run against
the same database at the same time.

Therefore, this patch provides an all new and optional
system of providing for individual, per-process databases
that last for the lifespan of when they are first needed
until the entire test suite completes.

The entry point for this system is that an environment
variable OSLO_SCHEMA_TOKEN is established local to a
particular test process.  Concurrent test processes would
each have a different value for OSLO_SCHEMA_TOKEN.

If OSLO_SCHEMA_TOKEN is not set, then the system works
in ""ad-hoc"" mode, which is exactly how the test runner
has always worked; an ad-hoc database when requested is
created as needed, typically during test setup, and
it is then dropped within the test's cleanup/teardown
phase, that is, the database is created/dropped per test.
This is roughly how openstack database tests run today in any case, so to
that degree, this patch does not remove any existing behavior,
it merely adds an option for an alternative system of
allowing the database to remain persistently, when OSLO_SCHEMA_TOKEN
is used.

The provisioning system within each process will then
create a database of this name for a particular backend
when a database for that backend is requested; for example,
if a test fixture requires a ""postgresql"" database and
the value of OSLO_SCHEMA_TOKEN is ""xyz"", a new postgresql
database ""xyz"" is created once, and then re-used for all
subsequent tests that request the same type of backend.

The databases can then be dropped by calling upon the
""drop"" command at the end of the test run, which can be passed
any number of ad-hoc database names to be dropped; names that
weren't actually created for a particular backend are skipped
so it can be safely called with a full set of names even if
those names were not all used for all backends.

Since the system deals with databases that last throughout
the entire run of tests, running with different kinds of
test runners requires that some kind of ""at the end of all
tests"" hook be established that will emit the drop command.
There are many ways that this can be achieved, and most test
runners also supply some built-in system of providing such a
hook.  However, there is currently no ""standard"" system for this
within openstack test suites, and this patch does not attempt
to solve that particular issue across the board.  Approaches
include integration with test runners such as py.test's conftest.py
mechanism, or the use of shell scripts.

As openstack tests have to a large extent standardized on the
use of the testr test runner, at least within continuous integration
systems, integration is proposed here to integrate the system
with testr when it runs, by using the ""instance provisioning""
feature of testr and calling upon the ""drop"" script within
.testr.conf, as well as running an ""echo"" script to generate
database names up front so that they can be passed through
testr's system.    testr to my knowledge offers no other mechanism for
invoking a global ""teardown"" feature that runs at the end of each
test process as a whole; if such a system does exist, it can
be proposed in lieu of using .testr.conf.

However it should be noted that the testr integration proposed
here in no way precludes the system from being integrated
with any number of other runners, nor does it imply that
the tests can no longer run with other runners, as the
patch here only offers OSLO_SCHEMA_TOKEN as an optional system,
disabled by default.   Any mechanism that can run a ""cleanup""
step at the end of a full test run can be integrated with
the concept here trivially.

During segmented (chunked) uploads of large files to Swift, if a
single segment fails to upload, Glance will abort the entire
upload, which could have been in progress for many hours.

However, if seek() and tell() methods are provided on the input
file stream, swiftclient will attempt to reset the filestream
back to the beginning of the segment and retry.

This patch adds glance.store.swift.BufferedReader to provide this
reset capability.  It works by buffering the segment/chunk in memory
in case an upload error occurs and a reset is required.  This could
potentially use a much larger amount of memory, so a CONF setting,
CONF.swift_store_reader_class is required to enable the new reader.
(The default is to use the existing glance.store.swift.ChunkReader.)

The test failures were a result of randomized test order and the way
in which these tests were setting up mocks for pexpect.spawn.expect
and pexpect.spawn.match.

The code now mocks pexpect.spawn and then sets return values and match
in each test as appropriate. Code in setUp establishes a patch and a
cleanUp function is added to reverse the patch. No code is required in
tearDown as a result.

execute() was being Mocked using code in setUp and tearDown and this
was replaced that with a similar patch in setUp with a corresponding
cleanUp function to reverse its effects.

Since we're close to Juno, I've not gone down the path of converting
this test to use a fixture which would further reduce duplicated code.

In a long-term effort to change the recommended ports for Swift,
the first step is to require the bind_port in config files. Later,
we can change the recommended setting.

Anyone currently explicitly setting the ports will not be affected.
Anyone not setting the ports will need to specify them to match their
rings.

Currently, lxc containers can be started only from an image.
Adding support to start lxc containers from block device volumes.

Separating the lxc disk handling code from _create_domain to _lxc_disk_handler
that will use block_device_mapping and will handle the pre and post lxc start
actions on the disk, both for images and volumes.

due to a change to keystonemiddleware.auth_token, which now adds
its own www-authenticate header in addition to the one that swift

This patch changes the functional test to check expected

www-authenticate values.

Requests to Neutron can fail during authentication when the auth_token
passed from Nova to Neutron via the client expires and this results in a
500 error in the Nova response. Rather than fail with a 500 error we can
handle the Unauthorized exception from the client and translate it to a
more specific NovaException, the new Unauthorized NovaException in this
case.

This patch only wraps the allocate/deallocate_for_instance methods but
can probably also be applied to more methods in the neutronv2 API.

Adds client argument to various helper methods, so methods would work in tenant
context. In these methods tenant_id is either an input or retrieved from
client's rest_client arguments
Argument tenant_id is kept for legacy reasons, but it's not needed. When
working with native clients, network_client used to be loaded with admin creds.
Since this is no longer the case, tenant_id is no longer required for most
cases, and can be deduced from client.

This patch adds ephemeral storage encryption for LVM back-end instances.
Encryption is implemented by passing all data written to and read from
the logical volumes through a dm-crypt layer. Most instance operations
such as pause/continue, suspend/resume, reboot, etc. are supported.
Snapshots are also supported but are not encrypted at present. VM rescue
and migration are not supported at present.

The proposed code provides data-at-rest security for all ephemeral
storage disks, preventing access to data while an instance is
shut down, or in case the compute host is shut down while an instance is
running.

Options controlling the encryption state, cipher and key size are
specified in the ""ephemeral_storage_encryption"" options group. The boolean
""enabled"" option turns encryption on and off and the ""cipher"" and ""key_size""
options specify the cipher and key size, respectively.

Note: depends on cryptsetup being installed.

Since we have multiple things reading from and writing to the
instance_extra table, we really need a way to just update the value
in a single column, by instance_uuid, without looking it up first,
without wiping the other columns, or updating them with stale data
introducing a race.

This adds the new API, updates instance_create() to pre-create the
extra record, and makes the numa_topology object do this sort of
update instead of creating the record itself. As a result of this
change, we no longer need instance_extra_create() exposed out of
the DB API.

DVR routers will have this manager initialized only after one
or more subnets have been attached to the router. To address
the issue, make sure the manager is defined and handle the snat
rules appropriately.

This patch also makes _update_arp_entry more defensive; this is
because the arp update process can be affected by the same issue:
the router may not have internal ports at the time the request
come in. This is likely when VM's port creation and router
configuration overlap slightly.

This introduces new run_process() and screen_service() functions and sets the
groundwork to change how DevStack starts services.  screen_service() is simply a
direct call to the screen portion of the old screen_it() function and is intended
to run commands that only need to run under screen, such as log file watchers.

run_process() is a replacement for screen_it() (which remains until all of the
services are updated).  The usage is similar but requires updates to every current
screen_it() call to remove everything that requires the command to be interpreted
by a shell.

The old run_process() and _run_process() functions are still present as
old_run_process() and _old_run_process() to support the deprecated screen_it()
function.  These will all go away in the future once all services have been
confirmed to have been changed over.

There is a similar new set of stop process functions stop_process() and
screen_stop_service().  The old screen_stop() will also remain for the deprecation
period.

As an initial test/demostration this review also includes the changes for
lib/cinder to demonstrate what is required for every service.

I included the scripts I used to test this; tests/fake-service.sh and
tests/run-process.sh are quite rough around the edges and may bite.  They should
mature into productive members of the testing ecosystem someday.

This change adds two config values that allow deployers
to enable user namespacing for libvirt-lxc containers.
User namespacing allows the mapping of uids and gids in
a container to separate uids and gids outside of the
container. The main advantage of this is to allow a
container's processes to appear to be running as root,
while actually running as a different user on the host.

Implements: bp libvirt-lxc-user-namespaces

DocImpact: This adds two config options to the libvirt
group, uid_maps and gid_maps. Default values are empty
strings and will leave user namespacing disabled for
libvirt-lxc containers.

To more cleanly support the various permutations of the following during
spawn():
- different types image to spawn with (sparse, flat, iso,
  and streamOptimized, ova in the futre)
- different ways to obtain the image (http download, and direct
  datastore copy in the future)
- different ways to prepare the downloaded image bits into a usable
  image in the image cache (replace -flat.vmdk extent, convert from
  sparse, pick from imported VM, ...)

The following are introduced:
- Image prepare/fetch/cache functions : these are callbacks for
  processing the bits into a usable form to be cached in the image cache
  under various scenarios.
- Image fetching functions : these are callbacks called by the processor
  to obtain the bits for the hypervisor.

All unit tests should pass unmodified after this refactor.

This should will allow for more self-contained additions/changes
to behaviors in these areas in the future.

Updates the Ironic compute driver and scheduler manager so that they
subclass the now in-Nova-tree driver classes. This should de-duplicate
code maintenance across Nova and Ironic and also provide end users
an easier upgrade path (with Deprecation log messages).

This patch also removes the old Ironic compute driver tests and classes
since those now live in Nova.

This patch also removes a line from tox.ini which was copying the second
set of unit test outputs; those no longer exist, since we are no longer
running unit tests on nova code in this tree.

There are dependency on backend details, that are stored in database,
in cmode driver. And if share server could not be created for some reason,
backend details won't be present in database. This fix updates database
at start of server creation, before sending request for creation.
There are still present possibility to get empty details, but it is
not related to driver itself, it is related to gap between creation of server
in database and call of driver's method for server creation. That could be,
for example, in case when share-network provided with wrong network data.

When nova-conductor received a NoValidHost (NVH) exception for a
cold migrate or resize operation, its error message back through
the API layer always displayed the string ""cold migrate"" in the
error text, even when the operation was a resize. This leads to
potentially confusing situations when triaging problems in the
cloud environment.

This patch corrects the error message based on the operation; we use
the flavor IDs as a way to determine what operation is really being
performed. In the case of a resize, different flavor IDs will be
used and they will be indentical in the case of a cold migration.

Note there was a lot of IRC discussion on this as well in terms of
the ""algorithm"" to check the operation type; the flavor ID check
is also used in the API layer as well since it's the only way you
can determine this given the underlying operation.  We also tried
to make the error message more general, but the consensus was that
was pretty unfriendly from the user's perspective - so we've landed
with this approach again with the end users close to heart.  :-)

VMwareVMOps.get_copy_virtual_disk_spec() became a no-op with the
removal of VMwareVCVMOps. This change removes it, and consequently
removes the copy_spec argument to vm_util.copy_virtual_disk, as it was
only ever being passed None.

We also remove vm_util.get_copy_virtual_disk_spec(), which is no
longer called at all after the removal of VMwareVCVMOps.

Allow hp1 to support up to 150 nodes, increasing the RAM quota to
1300000 will roughly achieve this. The other values are increased
so they don't get in the way (without being unlimited which will
hopefully prevent possible leaks).

The swift service is in the process of making it a requirement to
explicitly specify the bind_port for account, container & object
servers in their .conf files. See
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/118200/ for details.

The swift configuration in tripleo relies on default ports being
set by the swift service. Without these defaults swift in tripleo
will not function correctly.

This patch explicitly sets bind_port in the swift .conf files.

The bind_ports specified in the swift .conf files, if required
can be overridden using the tripleo passthrough mechanism.

This change also removes the use of hard coded swift port values
in elements/swift/os-refresh-config/configure.d/73-swift. With this
patch the ports are set in the .conf files and don't need to be
defaulted in 73-swift.

succinctly expressed with Fn::Replace uses a template-based approach.

Since Fn::Join does not exist in HOT, this moves us closer to porting our
templates over. What remains are operations that join lists returned by Heat or
Merge::Map into a single (usually '\n' separated) string. We can just return the
