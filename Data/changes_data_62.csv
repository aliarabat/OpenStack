""step"" and ""bootstrap"" are concepts to control when and where specific

when all services were running on host. However since we introduced
containerized services, puppet is executed at the beginning, with step

Under a lot of load, there can be situations where all the Neutron
workers have not updated their in-memory copy of the NB database
in time before certain operations.

This scenario can lead to stale resources when a somewhat recently
created port is attempted to be deleted, but the worker handling
this deletion doesn't know about the OVN port yet.

This patch detects this condition and allows some time (at least one
maintenance task cycle) before it deletes the OVN revision number.
If the port then shows up in the OVN database within that window, then
it will be deleted later by the maintenance task avoiding the stale
ports. If not, the revision number row will be deleted and we won't
stale these entries either.

The delete_port() method from OVNClient has a potential problem of
leaving stale ports when RowNotFound is raised from the process to
delete the port from the OVN database. Since the exception is not
granular enough, the RowNotFound could be raised from other objects that
are part of the same transaction (such as ACLs, DNS entries, etc...)
resulting in the revision for the port being deleted even tho the port
is still in the database.

Instead of giving a pass on the RowNotFound exception, this patch is
logging the error and re-raising it without deleting the revision.

As a part of CentOS Zuul job re-parenting effort,
It targets the build-containers jobs to use the
standard base job.

Under this patch:
- It adds tripleo-ci-base-singlenode-standard
  by moving common zuul job vars defined under
  tripleo-ci-base-singlenode-centos-8 and tripleo-ci-base-singlenode

- It uses the standard base as a parent for
   * tripleo-ci-base-singlenode-centos-9
   * tripleo-ci-base-singlenode-centos-8
   * tripleo-ci-base-singlenode (for C7)

- It adds
  tripleo-build-containers-base-noreposetup-required-projects-standard
  by merging the c7 and c8 job version of noreposetup-required-projects
  job.

- It adds tripleo-build-containers-base-noreposetup-standard by merging
  the c7 and c8 job version of base-noreposetup jobs.

- It follows the above same pattern and adds the following jobs
  - tripleo-build-containers-base-standard and its child
  tripleo-build-containers-base-with-files-standard.

And finally changes the new parent in build-containers job.

Based on above changes, it seems we are adding some job parent
for build container job (Which might be overcomed in a new review
later.)

This change introduces two new instance state waiters and uses them to
extend the existing tempest.common.compute.create_test_server wait_until
state support.

They are being introduced in an effort to allow the guest OS time to
start *before* we start attempting to interact with it either directly
by connecting to the instance or indirectly by hot-plugging or
hot-unplugging devices. The latter on some virt backends being an issue
if the guest OS is unable to respond to the underlying ACPI requests
sent to it.

It should be noted that these new states rely on the instance already
being ACTIVE before we begin to wait for the instance to either become
pingable or accessible over SSH. This is taken into account and will
always happen for these states even if validation isn't enabled in the
environment and thus it isn't possible to wait until the instance is
pingable or accessible over ssh.

The following points in the conductor server reduce the readability.

(i) The variable name `current_status` in ``_change_vnf_status`` is
confusing. It is a condition indicating the state to which is allowed to
transition to the next state.

(ii) The variable name `vnf_notif` in `_send_lcm_op_occ_notification` is
confusing. This is just a ``VnfLcmOpOcc``.

(iii) ``_get_vnf_notify`` is redundant and returns not notify but
``VnfLcmOpOcc``.

(iv) ``operation`` and ``operation_state`` in
``_send_lcm_op_occ_notification`` has default value, but it's better to
explicitly specify them.

(v) The nested if statement at ll. 1991-1996 strongly depends on
``vnflcm_driver``. Thus, the process here should be done by
``vnflcm_driver``.

This patch solves these problems as follow.

(i)   Renamed ``current_status`` to ``state_conditions``
(ii)  Renamed ``vnf_notif`` to ``vnf_lcm_op_occ``
(iii) Removed ``_get_vnf_notify`` and moved its contents to
``_send_lcm_op_occ_notification``
(iv)  Removed the default values
(v)   Moved the contents to ``vnflcm_driver``

When tox py37 target is called, first it installs the dependencies
(listed in 'deps') in 'installdeps' phase, then it installs
tripleo-ansible with install_command in 'develop-inst' phase.
And installdeps phase would install the wrong setuptools not
constrained with uc[1] and hence the failure.

Also, adds setuptools to requirements.

Glance yoga release notes generates one warning and as a result
it will fail to list it on release page [1] like it is
showing for Xena release.

The warning in the test log is;
""The Fixes section of

Rmoved the ""Fixes"" section from mentioned release note as it is already

Currently, the ICMP check can fail if the network
configuration takes too long. This can fail the
overall deployment, but the network configuration
can still be successful. This change broadens the
scope of the connectivity check by increasing the
number of IMCMP requests sent each time. To make
it more flexibile and allowing for situations where
interfaces take a little longer to become active.

starting to hit limits of tox' or Zuul's log side limit. This commit
attempts to limit number of requests by making sure that in case of

every pod. Moreover many `time.sleep()` occurences are modified to
reduce the number of the requests made.

Specifying a duplicate port ID is currently ""allowed"" but results in an
integrity error when nova attempts to create a duplicate
'VirtualInterface' entry. Start rejecting these requests by checking for
duplicate IDs and rejecting offending requests. This is arguably an API
change because there isn't a HTTP 5xx error (server create is an async
operation), however, users shouldn't have to opt in to non-broken
behavior and the underlying instance was never actually created
previously, meaning automation that relied on this ""feature"" was always
going to fail in a later step. We're also silently failing to do what
the user asked (per flow chart at [1]).

The Multiple Simultaneous Logins Control is a feature designed
for securing Horizon dashboard sessions. The default Horizon
configuration allows the same user to login several times
(e.g. different browsers) simultaneously, that is, the same user
can have more than one active session for Horizon dashboard. When
there is the need to control the active sessions that one user can
have simultaneously, it will be possible to configure the Horizon dashboard
to disallow more than one active session per user. When multiple simultaneously
sessions are disabled, the most recent authenticated session will be considered
the valid one and the previous session will be invalidated.

The following manual tests encompass both simulteaneous session control
configuration: 'allow' and 'disconnect' and were verified with this code
change before submitting it:

Test Plan:
PASS: Verify that a user is able to login to Horizon dashboard (when
configuration is 'disconnect')
PASS: Verify that a user is able to start a second Horizon dashboard
session and the first session is finished (when configuration is
'disconnect')

Failure Path:
PASS: Verify that when a user fails to authenticate a second Horizon
dashboard session the first session stills active (when configuration is
'disconnect')

Regression:
PASS: Verify that a user is able to login to Horizon dashboard (when
configuration is default: 'allow')
PASS: Verify that a user is able to start multiple simultaneous Horizon
dashboard sessions (when configuration is default: 'allow')

Ironic has changed the default PXE to be iPXE (as opposed to plain
PXE) in Yoga. Kolla Ansible supports either one or the other and
we tend to stick to upstream defaults so this change enables
iPXE instead of plain PXE - by default - the users are allowed
to change back and they need to take one other action so it is
good to remind them via upgrade notes either way.

Currently, if a multi-node cluster is shut down unexpectedly,

The purpose of this change is to add the possibility to use the

an unexpected shut down.

Regression:
PASS: OpenStack can be applied successfully
PASS: RabbitMQ nodes can join the RabbitMQ cluster

Currently kayobe supports defining custom playbook hooks to run before
and/or after a command.

There are cases where it would be useful to add hooks in the middle of a
command, particularly for host configuration which may have dependencies
between the playbooks.

This change adds support for hooks before or after any playbook, using a
target of pre-<playbook> or post-<playbook>.

In CentOS Stream 8 and 9 container image, centos-stream-release
package is already available in the container image. But in UBI,
it is not available. It can be installed from the base OS repo.

It removes the logic of downloading the centos-stream-release
rpm and installing it. As it was added earlier when we were
adding the initial support for EL9.

since redhat-release is a part of centos-stream-release
In UBI 8, redhat-release is a seperate package, so it's rpm
needs to be removed otherwise it will end up with skip broken
package.

On removing redhat-release, /etc/os-release file also gets deleted.
So we need to first remove redhat-release rpm if present and then
install centos-stream-release package.

It also removes dnf-core-plugins package installation as we donot
need to download the centos-stream-release rpm.

Under a lot of load, there can be situations where all the Neutron
workers have not updated their in-memory copy of the NB database
in time before certain operations.

This scenario can lead to stale resources when a somewhat recently
created port is attempted to be deleted, but the worker handling
this deletion doesn't know about the OVN port yet.

This patch detects this condition and allows some time (at least one
maintenance task cycle) before it deletes the OVN revision number.
If the port then shows up in the OVN database within that window, then
it will be deleted later by the maintenance task avoiding the stale
ports. If not, the revision number row will be deleted and we won't

This change introduces the capability to load clouds.yaml file in
the base Puppet::Provider::Openstack::Auth module, so that each
providers can look up credentials from clouds.yaml instead of rc file.
When SRBAC is enforced, services require appropriate scope for each
operation and this makes it difficult to use rc files which can store
only one credential per file. Usage of clouds.yaml allows us to store
multiple credentials in a single file and switch scopes according to
the API request used.

The new implementation loads the clouds.yaml file for admin user, which
is created by puppet-keystoe. It also allows overriding the credential
by a user-created clouds.file.

We expect clouds.yaml file is created under /etc/openstack, which is
the location openstackclient searches to look up clouds.yaml. To avoid
unexpected conjunction with existing files, the files used by puppet
are located in an independent 'puppet' directory at this moment.

Fixes ``redfish`` RAID interface workflow to not create more than 1
logical disks per controller at the same time when controller does not
support 'Immediate' application time and system needs rebooting.

With this fix virtual disks are grouped by controller and executed
in batches when reboot is required.

This enables ``redfish`` RAID interface to be used with iDRAC systems
directly as although there are many controllers that support 'Immediate'
application time, they do it only when system has completed loading.
System intermittently completes loading after IPA starts executing
clean or deploy steps rendering controllers not supporting 'Immediate'
apply time and requiring reboot. This fix handles such scenario
instead of failing to create more than 1 virtual disk.

1) typo in FAT filesystem label
2) failure of running mcopy

1) typo in FAT filesystem label

   Above mentioned commit misspells VFAT label as ``ir-vfd-de``

2) failure of running mcopy

   Till this commit, create_vfat_image function fails because it
   executes ``mcopy -s <tmp_dir>/*`` but it doesn't expand
   ``<tmp_dir>/*`` to list of file paths under ``<tmp_dir>``.

   This commit modifies create_vfat_image function to explicitly
   pass all file paths to mcopy.

There is a race condition between an incoming resize and an
update_available_resource periodic in the resource tracker. The race
window starts when the resize_instance RPC finishes  and ends when the
finish_resize compute RPC finally applies the migration context on the
instance.

In the race window, if the update_available_resource periodic is run on
the destination node, then it will see the instance as being tracked on
this host as the instance.node is already pointing to the dest. But the
instance.numa_topology still points to the source host topology as the
migration context is not applied yet. This leads to CPU pinning error if
the source topology does not fit to the dest topology. Also it stops the
periodic task and leaves the tracker in an inconsistent state. The
inconsistent state only cleanup up after the periodic is run outside of
the race window.

This patch applies the migration context temporarily to the specific
instances during the periodic to keep resource accounting correct.

- Migration: allow a new size to be specified during a volume migration.
New optional argument added '--new-size'.

- Retype: New flag '--migration-size' indicating that it's OK for the
volume to be increased in size if it's required for the retype to
succeed.

In this way we don't go behind the user's back -- we fail if the volume
won't fit, and allow them to retype to a new size if they want the

Due to the performance of the zuul environment, it may take a long time
to remove the kubernetes resource and an error may occur.
This patch avoids errors by increasing the
`kubernetes_vim.stack_retries` value in Tacker config and changes the
timeout to value calculated from config.
This patch also contains a fix for a test where sol003 heal ran twice

ansible 5 / ansible-core 2.12 raises the minimum version of Python to

When attaching a volume to a running instance the nova-api validates
that the volume is not already attached to the instance. However
nova-compute is responsible for actually creating the BDM entry in the
database. If sending attach requests fast enough it can be possible
that the same ""attach_volume"" request can be sent to nova-compute for
the same volume/instance combination.

To work around this we add a check in nova-compute to validate that

When attaching a volume to a running instance the nova-api validates
that the volume is not already attached to the instance. However
nova-compute is responsible for actually creating the BDM entry in the
database. If sending attach requests fast enough it can be possible
that the same ""attach_volume"" request can be sent to nova-compute for
the same volume/instance combination.

To work around this we add a check in nova-compute to validate that
the volume has not been attached in the mean time.

With Kuryr, when a service of LoadBalancer type is created the
process is the next:
- Create a load balancer
- Associate FIP to the load balancer VIP

In busy enviroments, with HA, there may be a race condition where
the method to associate the FIP to the loadbalancer fails to find
the recently created loadbalancer, therefore not doing the FIP to
VIP association in the OVN NB DB.

Note: This was fixed in more recent branches by commit:
https://opendev.org/openstack/ovn-octavia-provider/commit/c6cee9207349a12e499cbc81fe0e5d4d5bfa015c

However, this patch is doing many unrelated things, and this retry
mechanism should not have been part of it. Thus making the backport
of that part independent in this patch

not passed then the default container defined in the

When the InstanceNUMATopology OVO has changed in
I901fbd7df00e45196395ff4c69e7b8aa3359edf6 to separately track
pcpus from vcpus a data migration was added. This data migration is
triggered when the InstanceNUMATopology object is loaded from the
instance_extra table. However that patch is missed the fact that the
InstanceNUMATopology object can be loaded from the request_spec table as
well. So InstanceNUMATopology object in RequestSpec are not migrated.
This could lead to errors in the scheduler when such RequestSpec object
is used for scheduling (e.g. during a migration of a pre Victoria
instance with cpu pinning)

This patch adds the missing data migration.

This patch fixes a problem that causes a stack update to fail as a
result of changing the multipathd configuration. The original code
modifies /etc/multipath.conf on the host, and uses ""podman cp"" to
refresh the contents of the containers that require a copy.

The original intent was to avoid restarting containers that
asynchronously read from /etc/multipath.conf, but that approach no
longer works. Instead, the new code restarts each container that
needs its multipath.conf file refreshed.

At some point, podman (or something related) started using locks on
files used in a container volume mount. Now, attempts to update the
contents of /etc/multipath.conf inside a container will fail. Here's
an example when running the same command that tripleo_multipathd
executes:

[root@standalone ~]# podman cp /etc/multipath.conf multipathd:/etc/
Error: 2 errors occurred:
        * error copying to container: copier: put: error creating ""/etc/multipath.conf"": copier: put: error removing item to be overwritten ""/etc/multipath.conf"": unlinkat /etc/multipath.conf: device or resource busy
        * error copying from host: copier: get: ""/etc/multipath.conf"": error copying /etc/multipath.conf: io: read/write on closed pipe

Note: The stable/victoria backport includes a couple of fixes
for ansible lint issues that weren't previously detected.

This commit changes the os-reset_status volume-api
to handle the below use cases
1.Can not reset volume to ""ing"" states

2.available volume reset to in-use - 400

The _reset_status method is override in VolumeAdminController class
to handle different volume states.

NOTE: with this change, some requests that previously succeeded will
return a 400.  However, these were requests that would leave a resource
in an inconsistent state with an inaccurate status, so a 400 is
appropriate.  We use a 400 (not 409) to be consistent with the current
Block Storage API. This change is not microversioned because it doesn't
make sense to only prevent operators from shooting themselves in the
foot if they happen to specify an appropriate microversion,
and be grievously wounded otherwise.

Because of the fix for bug[1] and issue with linux_utils
get_process_count_by_name() L3 agent puts all it's HA ports down
during initialization phase. Unfortunately such operation can break
already working L3 communication. Rewiring ha-* port from down state to
up can takes few seconds and some VRRP packages could be lost then.
That triggers keepalived on other node so router HA state change
may be triggered.

This change prevents putting HA ports down when during initialization
phase L3 agent finds already configured own net namespaces. Existance
of such net namespace is a good proof that there is a network
configuration existing so host wasn't rebooted so most probably it is
just agent restart.

When a resource is created, the :ensure parameter should be set to
'present' so that exists returns true. In addition, the whole hash
should be cleared when a resource is deleted, otherwise subsequent
access might look up stale values. This change ensures property_hash is
updated in create/destroy accordingly.

This change also fixes the incorrect handling of ""project"" property
in nova_flavor which is causing unexpected update.

Finally, the ignored unit tests are fixed, to test the above fixes.

When applicable it is best to create/test resources with a non-admin
client. This commit reduces the need to use admin when creating ports.
In addition instead of using the 'host' parameter to force guest
scheduling with an admin client, use 'scheduler_hint' to direct guest
scheduling. 'scheduler_hint' does not require admin privileges, so
that reduces admin client use as well.

The multipathd daemon uses a hard-coded pidfile path that conflicts
with the one we use for conmon on the host. If we bind /run:/run
then multipathd overwrites the host file with its own pid, and this
interferes with systemd's ability to manage the service via the
pidfile. systemd expects the pidfile to contain the host's conmon
pid, not the multipathd daemon's pid.

When handling multiple router update/delete petitions, if they are

There were a number of discrepancies between the models and migrations

need to be addressed. In this patch, we correct a number of

take the form of adding the constraint to the model, but we also remove
a number of indexes defined on the models but not actually present in
the database (since they're not defined in migration).
