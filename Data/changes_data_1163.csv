This change provides a efficient way of replication
between regions of a global distributed cluster.

This approach makes object-replicator to push replicas
to a primary node in a remote region, then, to skip
pushing them to next primary node in the region with
expecting asynchronous replication.

This implementation includes a couple of changes on
ssync_sender to allow object-replicator to delete local
handoff objects correctly. One is to return a list of existing
objects in remote region. The list includes local paths of the
objects which exist both on the local device and the remote device.
The other is supporting existence check for specified objects.
It requires the object list build by the first change. When
the object list is given, ssync_sender does only missing_check
based on the list. These changes are needed because current
swift can not handle the existence check in object-level.

Note that this feature will work partially (i.e. only when
primary-to-primary) with rsync.

After the release of Swift ver. 2.0.0, some recon responses do not
show each policy's information yet. To make things worse, some recon
results only count on policy-0's score, therefore the total is not
shown in the recon results.

This patch makes the count of quarantined files policy-aware for recon
requests. Suppose a number of quarantined objects for policy-0 is 2
and a number for policy-1 is 3, recon sums up every policy's amount
and shows information for each policy as follows.

$ curl http://<host>:<port>/recon/quarantined
{""accounts"": 0, ""containers"": 0, ""objects"": 5, ""policies"": {""0"":
{""objects"": 2}, ""1"": {""objects"": 3}}}

This patch does a couple of things.  First it adds docstrings to the
client/server pair of the rpc interface used by an agent to report
state back to the plugin.  The docs tell you where the other side of
the interface is found in the code, and where docs are that give more
info on the rules for changing them.

The second thing done in this patch is to scope this interface using a
messaging namespace.  Right now some plugins expose several interfaces
via the default namespace.  This effectively means they are a single
API and should be managed with a single version stream.  It's much
more managable to just treat these as separate interfaces and this
change makes that explicit and functionally true.  Now when a method
is invoked, the only classes considered for handling that request will
be ones marked with the right namespace.

Part of blueprint rpc-docs-and-namespaces.

For a person entering documentation wondering what MultiStrOpt
semantics are, the existing documentation isn't much help.

Without an explanation of its parent class MultiOpt, MultiStringOpt
doesn't make much sense.  The ""kept for backwards-compatibility"" is
also rather confusing as it makes not mention why.

This adds MultiOpt to the documentation and explains its role.  I
couldn't see where it was being tested at all, so some minimal
test-cases are added for MultiOpt.

The other options are brought into line with the updated MultiStrOpt,
giving a link to the type they pass to Opt() and a better
backwards-compatibility message.

The Option Types section is also clarified a bit, and includes links
to relevant places.

If you have the following in the environment, the resource ""a_res"" will
be created with ""other.yaml"" instead of ""my.yaml"".

resource_registry:
  resources:

      OS::Nova::Server: my.yaml

The reason for this is that the resource name has not been passed into
get_resource_info().

HA standby routers must never transmit traffic from
any of their ports. This is because we allocate the same
port on all agents. For example, for a given external interface,
we place the same port with the same IP/MAC on every agent
the HA router is scheduled on. Thus, if a standby router
transmits data out of that interface, the physical switches
in the datacenter will re-learn the MAC address of the external
port, and place it on a port that's looking at a standby and
not at the master. This causes 100% packet loss for any incoming
traffic that should be going through the master instance of the
router.

Keepalived manages addresses on the router interfaces, and makes
sure that these addresses only live on the master. However, we
forgot about IPv6 link local addresses. They are generated
from the MAC address of the interface, and thus are identical on
all agents.

This patch tries to treat IPv6 link local addresses the same
as IPv4 addresses - define them as VIPs and let keepalived
move them around.

 - Sends the messages properly to the agent
 - Changes the cadence of checks (slightly slower)
 - Works off of MTMS for the host name

will attempt to create the role. However if 2 requests happen at

the conflict exception and treating it as the create succeeded (which it

This fixes the ""invalid credentials"" error that you will get
if you create a clean barbican environment and try to run the
functional tests.  It is actually a workaround for a change
to tempest (see https://review.openstack.org/#/c/147778/) which
causes a config object to be created BEFORE we get a chance to
set the path to OUR config.  When we set the path to our config
it is essentially ignored (since the config has already been
created) so the credentials in the tempest config aren't the
ones we set - hence the invalid credentials error.

This isn't an issue in devstack gate because our config
file isn't used.

This fix ensures that we will get our path update done before
tempest builds its config so our values will be used by tempest
when the real config object is created.

There is no sense in validation on client side. I believe we
don't want to have all validation logic in two places.

Also, the current validation was wrong for several reasons:
1. Wrong APIException usage (see bug description)
2. It required default_image_id for the cluster. Image could be
   set in each node group individually.
3. It required cluster_configs that is not mandatory

So, the only correct check was for node_groups field, but still
I don't think that client is the right place for checking such
things. If one day we will allow clusters with no nodegroups
client should allow that without modifications.

In Icehouse, Glance added a new field, 'virtual_size', to hold the
virtual size (as opposed to on-disk size) of sparsed or compressed
images. In most cases, this is far more valuable to know than the
on-disk size of an image; for instance, the official Fedora 21 QCOW2
image is only 150 Mb on disk, but is a 3 Gb image. This patch adds an
optional 'virtual size' field to the image detail view, and makes the
""Launch Instance"" modal use virtual size if it's available.

Storage capabilities is used to indicate the static and dynamic ability
of the storage driver object based on current driver implementation or
particular driver configuration and backend status.

Use storage capabilities glance_store can do more proper operations on
backend to support upper layer request, like to enable or disable add()
function to glance, or if allow glance reuse driver instance for all
request according to whether the driver and/or backend is stateless.

This patch implemented some initial capabilities for existing drivers,
and change the foundational code to make them be aware. Mainly it
contains:

1. Implemented essential code to enable driver capabilities, adding
necessary capabilities.

2. Added a generic checker on necessary storage operations, to make sure
the capabilities of the driver are capable of handling requested
operation. We can enhance the check logic as needed easily in future.

3. Added a callback based schedule logic to update dynamic capabilities
of store when operator enabled it by a option.

4. Refactoring on existing disablement logic on driver add() interface,
to use consistent capabilities way to handle it, removed add_disabled().

5. Therefor the related exception conversion logic for other interfaces
are redundant, due to now we can raise proper exception directly from
the checker.

6. Added the logic to recreate drive object if the storage and/or driver
isn't stateless.

Few minor changes need to be added to Glance side:

we'd use the one stored on the object if possible. That has been
not that useful, and also a source of infinite confusion for people

ambiguity and require that the object have an embedded context in

In nova, we used a metaclass to ensure that merely defining an object as
inheriting from the base would register it for use. I don't feel that is
a responsible way for the library to behave, since just importing a module
full of objects would allow things to be registered which might enable
RPC methods that are undesired.

Further, it complicated our ability to register alternate implementations
of certain objects, and provided no end of complication to our tests.

This patch adds a decorator-based object registry that looks much the same,
but requires explicit opt-in registration to objects before they can be
deserialized over RPC and instantiated by name.

Currently, oslo team starts to drop old oslo namespace, the old import
style can work now, but not any more in next development cycle. We've
already done and will continue do the migrate jobs, but we need a way
to prevent accidently import such issue again. The hacking rules cannot
satisfy the need, so let's do the local check.

Code are basically stolen from Nova project.

Note, this patch also fixes some new introduced oslo namespace issues.

This sync is crucial to adopting oslo.log, the bulk of the changes
are for the oslo modules to use python standard logging instead of
relying on oslo.log.

from keystone:
  rm -rf keystone/openstack/common

from oslo-incubator:
  python update.py ../keystone

Had to undo the changes to local.py and log.py since they are still
being used throughout keystone.

Also, with the sync came a change to versionutils, which now
emits a deprecation exception from versionutils instead of
the incubator's log.py. This meant that a test had to be updated
to catch the appropriate exception.

Table styling for Launch Instance workflow, details panels and other
screens in Horizon. Responsive design hides lower priority columns
as window becomes narrower. De-prioritized column values can be displayed
in details row. Included also are directives (extending Smart-Table)
that deal with user interaction such as expanding row to show more
detail and the check all checkbox.

Manual settings when using these tables:
  - priority for each column (<td class=""rsp-p1"">)
  - de-prioritized column values to show elsewhere
    (<div class=""rsp-alt-p1"">{$ row.name $}</div>)
  - action column width
  - detail row 'padding-right' to account for action column width

This patch catches DBDuplicateError when initializing ML2 GRE type
driver and allocation already exists in DB. Because current allocations
are queried and then only those that doesn't exist in database are
added, DBDuplicateError should never occur.

But the race can happen when running multiple neutron-servers and one
of servers adds allocations between allocations are queried and added.

The 'image_cache_max_size' is an upper limit beyond which pruner,

In some cases (eg. DRAC), the driver doesn't provide any information to
figure out the root device during RAID configuration. A workaround for
that is creating the RAID disks in 2 runs: one run for the root device
and another one for the rest. In between ironic-discoverd can be used to
examine the changes in the block devices.

This patch adds this capability as a plugin to gather the block device
serials, save it temporarly and expose the root device hint.

Some oslo libraries assume that stdlib is already patched when
they are imported (e.g. oslo_concurrency.processutils tests the
'time' module for monkey_patching to detect which 'subprocess'
module to import.

This can cause issues when things like test frameworks import
modules that monkey_patch, as the order imports are made can break
this kind of check. It is always good to monkey patch as soon as
possible, hence trying to do the patching in neutron/__init__.py.

This is an alternative to https://review.openstack.org/#/c/153225/
which just patches neutron/tests/__init__.py. Unfortunately, just
monkey_patching in tests/__init__.py didn't fix all of the issues
I ran into. For example, tempest tests were failing with timeouts.

graceful shutdown in the stop method is leading to potential
deadlock situations when conductor is running in the main thread

shutdown on all running services then wait/join everything together

This patch does a couple of things.  First it adds docstrings to the
client/server pair of the rpc interface used by the ovs agent
to make dvr related calls back into the Neutron server.  The docs
tell you where the other side of the interface is found in the code,
and where docs are that give more info on the rules for changing them.

The second thing done in this patch is to scope this interface using a
messaging namespace.  Right now some plugins expose several interfaces
via the default namespace.  This effectively means they are a single
API and should be managed with a single version stream.  It's much
more managable to just treat these as separate interfaces and this
change makes that explicit and functionally true.  Now when a method
is invoked, the only classes considered for handling that request will
be ones marked with the right namespace.

Part of blueprint rpc-docs-and-namespaces.

When adding flavors, the trove account was being used.  This now
generates the following error:

ERROR (Forbidden): Policy doesn't allow compute_extension:flavormanage
to be performed.

According to http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide-cloud/content under
cumpute/system administration/flavors:

""Configuration rights can be delegated to additional users by redefining
the access controls for compute_extension:flavormanage in
/etc/nova/policy.json on the nova-api server.""

and

""Admin users can use the nova flavor- commands to customize and manage
flavors.""

Instead of trying to manipulate the policy file, this fix just uses the
admin account to add the necessary flavors.

If a user specify a url such as

modified to show this.  While we're there, flesh out the long_msg for

When user tries to create a network which VLAN ID is already used by another network,
Network object will throw a DuplicateVlan exception. However, when the exception get
propagate to the API level, it is only treated as a regular exception. This fix is to
treat DuplicateVlan exception as a special exception (similar to DuplicateCidr) so that
users know more about what kind of duplicated setting they configured.

One of the biggest issues with subunit-trace is when non-subunit data
is passed into it gets dropped by subunit trace. This patch is an
attempt (based on a similar patch to subunit-2to1) to allow non subunit
data existing before the subunit stream to be printed on stdout. After the
stream is detected however any other stdin unrelated content will still be
lost.

This should be merged to master and stable/6.0

Added ""Add MongoDB nodes"" to Ops-Guide section about redeploying nodes

Added link to that section from Release Notes; reworded Release Notes to
say MongoDB nodes can not be added using the Fuel Web UI.

Added information to the fuel-ref/astute.yaml page about
the ceilometer/mongodb settings that are referenced from this procedure.

I added the full contents of the Target astute.yaml file and did a quick
pass to divide it into sections that can be discussed reasonably; most of
the work on this reference page will be done in a separate CR.

I did fix the file-ref doc so the TOC only shows the top-level section
(the file name) rather than all the subsections.

There are cases seen in the Gate where a target delete is
called and an exception is raised because the target does
not exist. In the cinder target driver code we raise this
as an ISCSITargetRemoveFailed exception, but if we're asking
to delete the target and the target doesn't exist we can
probably safely move along.

This patch adds a check for this specific case and logs a warning
and continues rather than failing.  We also add a unit test to
check this case.

Qualified names were often not fully qualified within
their defined namespace. For example, modA.modB.ClassC.methD
would be named modB.methD at best because we were not tracking
the namespace as we traversed the AST nor were we determining
the full qualified name of the module py file we are scanning.

We improve this by making a eduated guess as the fully qualified
name of a module based on the module path. See
bandit.core.utils.get_module_qualname_by_path. We traverse
the path from right to left. If the directory has a __init__.py
we assume it is a parent module. Tests were added in
tests_util.py.

Since bandit could be used to scan files not in their final install
location we also warn that the file is not in an install path
and we may not get the proper fully qualified name.

We also track the namespace as we traverse the AST. We use
the module's FQ name as above as the module's base namespace.
We add a Class node visitor which updates that namespace
upon entering and leaving a Class definition. We do the same
for Func nodes to deal with nested functions. Utility functions
were added for managing namespace path that are similar to
os.path.{join,split}

This is the final part of the more comprehensive split of
assignments, which rationalizes both the backend and controllers.
In order to make this change easier for reviewers, it is divided
into a number of smaller patches. This patch divides up the
assignment controller, giving resource its own controller.

Previous patches have:
- Moved role management into its own manager and drivers
- Fixed incorrect doc strings for grant driver methods
- Updated controllers to call the new role manager
- Updated unit tests to call the new role manager
- Refactored the assignment manager and drivers enabling
  projects/domains to be split out
- Fixed incorrect comment about circular dependency between
  assignment and identity
- Moved the logically separated project and domain
  functionality into their own manager/backend (called resource).
- Removes unused pointer to assignment from identity driver
- Uddated controllers and managers to call the new resource

SecurityImpact

ReleaseNote
This patch  adds an option attestation_insecure_ssl in TrustedFilter which can be
used to verify CAs. The default value is set to True, disabling SSL certificate
verification. While this is the insecure option, it was selected for backward
compatibility reasons.

When using the shade library with ansible playbooks and classical
environment variables for authentication, it is possible for a
region_name value to be passed in with the value of None.

When the value is set to and preserved as None, the logic later
on in the method will fail to create a config key/value entry for
region_name which is required by code later on in the method.

Modified the region_name check to not only check for the presence
of a missing region_name value, but to check to see if that value
is set to None.  This allows the value to be reset preventing the
method from failing on the return call due to a missing key.

The lb_reload() logic is moved into a separate module of the scaling
library.  A new test case is added to test this utility function.

Since the revised _lb_reload() method checks if LOAD_BALANCER_NAMES is
defined/provided or not, the OpenStack version of AutoScalingGroup
doesn't have to implement an empty _lb_reload() method now.

In preparation for releasing a new novaclient cap python-novaclient on
stable/juno to prevent the new release from possibly breaking stable.

Note: There is a in progress patch to pin all stable/juno requirements,
but it isn't ready yet. So do this in the meantime.

A couple of tests were leaking `setUp` state causing the
`test_can_resize_need_fs_type_specified` test to randomly fail.

This probably passed in the gate due to the ordering happening to be correct
everytime. Since I'm using `nosetests`, I happen to be running the tests in
the 'wrong' order.

The solution is to have the tests clean up their state between runs.

The keystoneclient tests were using the library installed from a
git clone. Rather than do a clone of master, the tests will now just
use the keystoneclient installed to the venv.

Doing a `git clone` causes problems on any system without reliable
Internet access, and since the keystoneclient tests have changed to
being for functional tests rather than for verifying
backwards-compatibility of the client, this will make things easier.
