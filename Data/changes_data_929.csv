When the gate fails, for any reason, its possible the logs generated
by the services are not accessible by the jenkins worker which does
cause problems when the logs are uploaded for analysis. To ensure the
gate always has access to the logs a trap was added to the gate script
which is used to guarantee the gate has access to the logs by recursively
setting the mode to 0777 on all files within the ""/openstack/logs""
directory.

The function ""gate_job_exit_tasks"" has been added to the
script-libraries.sh file

finish_migration contains some code which converts raw disks to qcow2
when moving from a host which uses raw disks to a host which uses
qcow2 disks. This was erroneously also converted config disks, which
are hard-coded to be raw even when other disks are qcow2.

This has always been broken, but it wasn't previously exposed because
a subsequent bug unconditionally overwrote the qcow2 config disk with
a new, raw one. Change I03e08fae97416ebe5cdedcf238a06d1b90203c5d
changed the order of these 2 events, so that the erroneously-converted
config drive was no longer overwritten, resulting in a qcow2 file
being presented to the instance as raw.

This change explicitly filters out config disks from conversion.

NOTE(mriedem): The test conflict is due to fbe31e461 not being in

This makes Flavor.create() fail until the main database has had all
of its flavors migrated. Since we want to avoid any overlap or clashes
in integer ids we need to enforce this. The flavor API was poorly
designed in that it exposes this internal id. Luckily, flavor creation
is infrequent and flavor migration is fast.

The flavors in our database are hard-coded in the first migration,
which means we have to basically do the migration during every
unit test in order to avoid having a legacy environment. Since that
leaves us with deleted flavors in the DB (which screws up the DB
archiving tests), this adds a hard_delete flag to the migration to
do an actual purge of those from our database. What a mess.

With current code, there are 2 issues.

1) The prevent snat rule that is added for floating ip will be
cleaned, when restarting the l3 agent. Without this rule, the fixed
ip will be SNATed to floating ip, even if the network request is to
an internal IP.

2) The prevent snat rule will not be cleaned, even if the external
device(rfp device) is deleted. So, when the floating ips are removed
from DVR router, there are still dump rules in iptables. Restarting
the l3 agent can clean these dump rules.

The fix in this patch will handle DVR floating ip nat rules at the
same step to handle nat rules for other routers(legacy router, dvr
edge router)

After the change in [1], the fip nat rules for external port have
been extracted together into a method. Add all rules in that method
in the same step can fix the issue of ping floating ip, but reply
with fixed ip.

This disables the Protractor E2E tests due to a high failure rate
related to a protractor/chrome bug [1] where ChromeDriver would
frequently hang. The E2E tests were mainly used to check for
dependency injection failures, but they didn't catch all (or even
most) failures. Instead, this enables angular's built-in 'strictDi'
mode, which will raise errors during normal development (i.e.
non-production builds) and during unit tests whenever a bad injection
is used.

From time to time we see network connectivity issues from instances
to various destinations. Particularly negative impact occurs if jobs
can't reach the main git mirror, since they pretty much all need to
check it for updates to whatever repo(s) they use. It's helpful, in
these instances, to be able to provide traceroutes from the affected
instances so that our providers can diagnose potential issues within
their networks.

Explicitly guard these commands with ""|| true"" in case they're not
installed, so as to avoid my earlier mishap.

This will force pip install to use the upper-constraints.txt specified
version of pip modules. When you don't do this, you are out on the
bleeding edge and become unstable everytime some python library in the
wide world changes in a way that you don't expect.

The post jobs can not use constraints file, so override the install
command there.

When the gate fails, for any reason, its possible the logs generated
by the services are not accessible by the jenkins worker which does
cause problems when the logs are uploaded for analysis. To ensure the
gate always has access to the logs a trap was added to the gate script
which is used to guarantee the gate has access to the logs by recursively
setting the mode to 0777 on all files within the ""/openstack/logs""

The function ""gate_job_exit_tasks"" has been added to the

So, even though this was the initial state of the database. Having
the URL as 500 makes the creation of the database break in InnoDB
databases. This is because InnoDB databases have the hard limit that
indexes should be of a length of 767 bytes maximum. Now, the
'values_index' index is of 36 (container_id) + 255 (name) + 500 (URL)
which is bigger than 767 (791 in total actually). So this CR sets
that as 255, to avoid that.

The reason of choosing 255 as the length of the URL, is because that
is the value that the model has currently. So that value appears both
in the current model [1] and a migration script [2].

Standard Unix utilities like `ls` will helpfully colorize their
output so users may quickly distinguish files from directories.

Swift has been lacking this for too long. Now, operators can add
a new ""color"" middleware to the proxy pipeline to automatically
colorize text/plain responses to account and container listings.

Clients may configure the colors used via a new Ls-Colors header,
similar to the $LS_COLORS environment variable. The cluster operator
may specify a default set of colors to use if the client did not
specify.

purely volume or volume-snapshot related CLIs and python
API bindings during Kilo. python-cinderclient should be
used for the python API bindings now, and python-openstackclient
should be used for the CLI for those operations.

The alternate_service_type context manager is also removed
since it was only used for proxying through to the volume API
endpoint.

Since the proxy for creating volumes is removed, we have to
add python-cinderclient for testing the volume attachment
CLIs/APIs that are left intact.

Neutron has had a review velocity issue since the beginning

and introduced the lieutenants system.

Now it's time for out of the box thinking. I hereby propose

This adds branch name to the default URLs for IPA images, ensuring that
devstack runs will use the correct branch of IPA for tests.

It introduces a variable IPA_DOWNLOAD_BRANCH to accomplish this, which
defaults to master. This default will be set to the branch name on
stable branches, e.g. stable/mitaka. It is modified to match our URL
scheme for agent images, e.g. stable-mitaka.

This cherry-pick is modified to set the default to stable/mitaka.

This change modifies networking-calico's requirements and DevStack setup
so as to use master Neutron code instead of stable/liberty.

DevStack bootstrap script changes:

- Use master DevStack by default (which means using master of all
  OpenStack code), but support arbitrary devstack branch via the new
  DEVSTACK_BRANCH variable.
- Change subnet CIDR from 10.65.0/24 to 10.65.0.0/24, as Neutron
  apparently now requires full length.

Test requirements:

- Use master Neutron code instead of stable/liberty.
- Hide test requirements from DevStack.  DevStack's installation of test
  requirements is currently failing [1], so avoid that by renaming the
  file.

This PR changes the api_url setting in ironic.conf to correctly use the

Previously this used the hosts IP address, which would mean each host
specified it's own IP address causing issues connecting to the ironic
API hosts instead of the conductor hosts.

virt-sparsify checks to see if there is enough space using an estimate based on the
virtual size of the disk (40G in our case). The actual size is substantially smaller.
The default behavior for virt-sparsify is ""warn"" - which in this context will cause
the shell task to hang forever waiting for a CR to ack the warning.  We presently use
""fail"" which is the safest option and will never cause a nasty failure due to a volume
that is completely filled up.  This change permits a pragmatic middle ground, where
we still default to the safe option (fail) but allow for pragmatism (I have 20G free
but not 40....do it anyway).

There are some inter-related changes required to avoid using legacy
fallback/deprecated paths in heat, which result in warnings in the
Heat log, e.g because we fall-back to reusing keystone auth_token
configuration instead of heat specific sections.

To fix this:
- Don't explicitly set deferred_auth_method=trusts, as this is now
  the default (since kilo). So switch to $::os_service_default.
- Create a new ""trustee"" section containing configuration used for
  the password auth-plugin associated with deferred authentication
  via trusts (support for this was added during liberty to enable
  us to stop incorrectly using the keystone auth_token config)
- Create a ""clients_keystone"" section to avoid falling back to the
  legacy behavior of stealing the uri from auth_token.

The copytruncate directive in logrotate configuration truncates the log file so
that processes can keep using the same file descriptor to write to the log

rsyslog fails to figure out the difference from last sent messages.

This commit provides source code for the first phase of HBase support
in OpenStack Trove. As described in the blueprint, this phase provides
HBase standalone and HBase pseudo-distributed operation.

Users will be able to create (using elements provided in
trove-integration chkin (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/262048/) an
HBase instance using the standard 'trove create' operation.

Once created, the operations supported at this stage include instance
and disk resize, restart, and backup. As noted in the blueprint,
backup will take a dump of the data after stopping the HBase
instance. At a later stage, a more sophisticated backup strategy can
be implemented.

Support is provided for interacting with the HBase instance using the
hbase shell, the Java API, a REST API and the Thrift API.

Microversions since Nova API v2.1 are aimed to replace the v3 work.

The /v2.1 is backwards compatible with the legacy /v2 endpoint.

What we called in the past /v3 is now something defunct in-tree. The /v2.1 API is based on the v3 work, but there are many things that differ, in particular with the backwards-compat thing I mentioned earlier.

We keep the /v2 path in api-paste.ini for making sure an upgrade doesn't trample operators and users but if you look in tree, that's redirecting to the v2.1 codepath (just not asking for microversions)

https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/etc/nova/api-paste.ini#L18

In summary, we only need one endpoint, ie. /v2.1

If self-signed certificates are in use, you need to be able to inform
Trove that it should establish an insecure connection with those
services. Many OpenStack services support this by passing an insecure
argument to the HTTPClient.

This change adds new configuration options:

nova_api_insecure,
neutron_api_insecure,
cinder_api_insecure,
swift_api_insecure, and
api_insecure

Each of the first four determine whether or not the API's for those
services is insecure (default=False). The fifth one indicates that all
of them are insecure (default=False).

You could therefore choose to turn on insecure on just one of the
services, or easily enable it for all services that Trove accesses.

If we don't do this, then a number of modules will be missing from
the image's ramdisk.  One example is the multipath module - this
has a dependency on device-mapper-multipath, which is installed as
part of the image build.  However, by default the ramdisk is not
rebuilt after the package is installed so it never takes effect.

This is the particular case I'm trying to address because it
prevents deploying to diskless systems that use iscsi targets as
their root disks.  With this change, the necessary modules for such
a deployment will be in the ramdisk.

A recurring pattern when using multiple mocks is to create a closure
decorated with mocks like:

    def test_thing(self):
            @mock.patch.object(self.compute, 'foo')
            @mock.patch.object(self.compute, 'bar')
            def _do_test(mock_bar, mock_foo):
                # Test things
        _do_test()

However it is easy to leave off the _do_test() and have the test pass
because nothing runs. This check looks for that pattern.

In this change 'use_router_proxy' option was added
to switch between direct connections and proxy.

Proxy was reimplemented and splitted onto two
types of proxies:

    * PUBLISHER proxy for fanout pattern
    * ROUTER proxy for direct messaging

Each type of proxy is configured over command line
argument --type.

Deployment guide was updated accordingly to the change.

The following warning appears in the swift proxy logs:
""Using the in-process token cache is deprecated as of the 4.2.0
release and may be removed in the 5.0.0 release or the 'O'
development cycle. The in-process cache causes inconsistent results
and high memory usage.""

Specifying the location of a memcached server will not only clean up
a deprecation warning in the logs but should provide a performance
improvement.

This is caused by the absence of a memcached_servers key in the
proxy configuration. While this variable is defined as a group var
in the integrated release we insulate against the absense of this
value in stand-alone role usage or Swift Stand-Alone deploys which
may not include memcached yet to prevent upgrade impacts.

This change adapts networking-calico's code so that it works with the
Neutron master code, as well as continuing to work with Liberty and
previous OpenStack releases.  As we're now very close to the Mitaka
release, working with master Neutron code should also mean working
with the Mitaka release.

Handle removal of deprecated use_namespaces option:

- Don't override use_namespaces, as it no longer exists to be
  overridden.
- Handle new Mitaka NetModel calls that don't allow a use_namespaces
  argument, and set _ns_name attribute to get equivalent effect.
- Use subclassing to override pieces of the DHCP agent implementation
  that assume they own their own namespace (and so delete unknown
  devices, and set the default route).

Adapt for other Neutron changes since Liberty:

- neutron.agent.linux.dhcp's commonutils import changed to common_utils.
- DHCP agent code now requires NetModel.mtu to be a number (or else for
  'advertise_mtu' to be configured False).
- New mtu parameter in RoutedInterfaceDriver.plug_new.
- Adjust test code for different eventlet thread timing.

client will pick the endpoint for the first region returned instead of
the one specified.

Currently we are using only the resulting MAC(s) when doing a node lookup.
In many cases it is the MAC of the PXE-booting NIC. However, it's not necessary
the MAC that people used for enrolling the Ironic node, which will lead to
lookup failures on the virtual environment. This change makes the lookup
procedure use all of the valid MAC's.

Similarly, the enroll node_not_found_hook now checks all MAC's before creating
a node.

Code in the validate_interfaces hook was reordered to ensure we only keep
interfaces with valid MAC's even in the ""all_interfaces"" list.

When a router is manually scheduled we check if a router can be scheduled
to the given L3 agent. In this check we were missing handling for
HA router, instead we raised an exception as a last resort.

In addition, we create an HA port on the newly scheduled agent.
The HA port is created within the router's namespace on that agent.
Previously when manually scheduling this was not done at all.

This patch takes care of HA routers by allowing them to be
manually scheduled to a L3 agent if the router is not already
scheduled to that given L3 agent.

The patch also adds an HA port in the router's namespace on the newly
scheduled L3 agent.

In addition the patch also removes the 'max_l3_agents_per_router'
enforcement when manually schedulling a router on a agent. This is
done as the admin should be able to schedule a router on an agent
if he desires, moreover this is consistent with the
'min_l3_agents_per_router' that is not enforced when manually
descheduling a router from an agent.

This patch has two reviews:

1.  devstack has moved default Keystone API version to v3[1].
[1] https://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack/commit/f4ce44bf3fbf06e53c2ae3ec6aa4996831cf4605
Though the above patch has been reverted, this would help
if devstack removes v2 support in the future.

2. use domain env variables as defaults.
Use OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME and OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME
env variables as the defaults for keystone v3 in
integration tests.

This will force pip install to use the upper-constraints.txt specified
version of pip modules. When you don't do this, you are out on the
bleeding edge and become unstable everytime some python library in the

The releasenotes job has no constraints file, so override the install
command there.

This commit is being proposed on stable/liberty and therefore the
install command includes the clear designation of the branch. This is
because, on branches other than master, we need to be sure to get the
upper-constraints.txt file for that branch.

If a certificate expires, the user will need to update it.  However,
because we only restart services at the end of a stack-update the
new certificate doesn't take effect until after puppet has run.
This is a problem because puppet makes OpenStack calls, which will
fail if the certificate is expired.  In that case we never get to
the service restart so the stack is wedged until the user manually
restart haproxy.

This patch addresses the problem by reloading haproxy before puppet
runs.  This is done in a pre-puppet script for pacemaker after pacemaker
is maintenance mode because we need to make sure it happens after all of
the certs have been installed on the controllers, but before puppet
runs.

For non-pacemaker, haproxy is simply reloaded.

Microversions since Nova API v2.1 are aimed to replace the v3 work.

The /v2.1 is backwards compatible with the legacy /v2 endpoint.

What we called in the past /v3 is now something defunct in-tree. The /v2.1 API is based on the v3 work, but there are many things that differ, in particular with the backwards-compat thing I mentioned earlier.

We keep the /v2 path in api-paste.ini for making sure an upgrade doesn't trample operators and users but if you look in tree, that's redirecting to the v2.1 codepath (just not asking for microversions)

https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/etc/nova/api-paste.ini#L18

In summary, we only need one endpoint, ie. /v2.1

When the ARP responder is enabled, secondary IP addresses explicitly
allowed by via the allowed-address-pairs extensions do not resolve.
This change adds the ability to enable the local ARP responder similar
to the feature in the OVS agent.  This change disables local ARP
responses by default, so ARP traffic will be sent over the overlay.

expects a file path for the record argument instead of boolean

The openstack/kolla repository has followed the
release:cycle_with_milestones schedule +/- 1-3 days for all
milestones except where the PTL was ill with a root canal that
failed causing Mitaka-1 to be tagged far later then it should have
been. In that case, the PTL added backup release managers
(Sam Yaple and Angus Salkeld) so that wouldn't occur in the future.

Still we are faced with a problem.  Some things we depend on, like
the RDO upstream release of a release for our binary packaging
for CenTOS or the Ubuntu cloud-archive release of our binary packaging
for Ubuntu lag the official release deadlines by a week or more.

Further, some projects we depend on are either late, or make last
minute changes which break Kolla or introduce deprecations during
RC's which we fix in that release.

Hence this tag change depends on an extension to the
release:cycle_with_milestones deadline to deal with the special
cases deployment projects have to deal with.

Our alternative here is to tag a z.0.0 release on the posted schedules
that may be DOA in some ways (especially around binary packaging) and
shortly after those problems are sorted out, release a z.0.1 release.
