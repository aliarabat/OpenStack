Based on the description of the notify_on_api_faults config option [1]
and the code that uses it [2] nova sends and api.fault notification
if the nova-api service encounters an unhandle exception.
There is a FaultWrapper class [3] added to the  pipeline of the REST
request which catches every exception and calls the notification sending.

Based on some debugging in devstack this FaultWrapper never catches any
exception. Every REST API method is decorated with expected_errors
decorator [5] which as a last resort translate the unexpected exception
to HTTPInternalServerError. In the wsgi stack the actual REST api call is
guarded with ResourceExceptionHandler context manager [7] which translates
HTTPException to a Fault [8]. Then Fault is catched and translated to
the REST response [7]. This way the exception never propagates back to
the FaultWrapper and therefore the api.fault notification is never emitted.

Based on the git history of the expected_errors decorator this notification
was never emitted for v2.1 API and as the v2.0 API now supported with the
same codebase than v2.1 it is not emitted for v2.0 calls either. As nobody
reported a bug I assume that nobody tried to use this notification for a very
long time. Therefore instead of fixing this bug this patch propses to remove
the dead code.

See a bit more detailed description on the ML [9].

- Remove translations

  Nobody is using translations for Rally and I don't think that
  anybody is going to use it. Target auditory for Rally are
  developers/operators which usually know well english.
  For me this looks like waste of resources, performance
  degradation (cause we are calling _()), complexity
  (+1 thing that you need to know)

- Pass to log already formatted strings

  It's very bad because in case of wrong formatting, it
  doesn't fail instead just writes errors to the logs,
  as well information about trace is lost, so it's super
  hard to fix it

  Log wrapper doesn't allow to use LOG anymore for
  formatting strings

  All places are fixed

- Improve logging of exceptions

LOG.exception() already logs exception, which means it's bad idea to
pass str(e) to it. Instead we should provide clear description of what
happend. Improved few places to write warnings or exceptions in case
of different level of logs. In few places just use LOG.exception

- Part of log messages were improved and simplified

When bug 1709902 was fixed in I0df401a7c91f012fdb25cb0e6b344ca51de8c309
the fix assumed that when the _destroy_evacuated_instances() is called
during the init of the nova-compute service the resource tracker
already knows the compute node ids associated to the given compute
host. This is not true and therefore _destroy_evacuated_instances fails
with and exception and does not clean up the evacuated instance.

The resource tracker's compute_nodes dict only initalized during the
first update_available_resource call that happens in the
pre_start_hook. While the _destroy_evacuate_instances called from
init_host which is called before the pre_hook_start.
The _destroy_evacuated_instances call uses the
_delete_allocation_for_moved_instance that relies on the resource
tracker's compute_nodes dict.

This patch inlines _delete_allocation_for_moved_instance in
_destroy_evacuated_instances and queries the db for the compute node
uuid. As ironic uses 1:M host:node setup we cannot ask the db only once
about the node uuid as different instances might be on different nodes.

NOTE(mriedem): A couple of changes had to be made to the compute
manager code since I0883c2ba1989c5d5a46e23bcbcda53598707bcbc is
not in stable/pike.

When bug 1709902 was fixed in I0df401a7c91f012fdb25cb0e6b344ca51de8c309
the fix assumed that when the _destroy_evacuated_instances() is called
during the init of the nova-compute service the resource tracker
already knows the compute node ids associated to the given compute
host. This is not true and therefore _destroy_evacuated_instances fails
with an exception and does not clean up the evacuated instance.

The solution for the original bug included a functional regression
test. However the functional test env is not capable of fully simulate
a nova-compute service restart. The service only stopped then started
again. This allows some in memory state of the compute service to
survive the simulated restart. This caused that the functional test
was not able to catch that the above described assumption is not
correct.

Change I868a0dae0baf8cded9c7c5807ea63ffc5eec0c5e adds some
code that relies on the VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_REBASE_COPY_DEV flag
which was introduced to libvirt in commit
b7e73585a8d96677695a52bafb156f26cbd48fb5 which went into the
1.2.9 release:

https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=blob;f=docs/news-2014.html.in

The nova change went into the Pike release and was backported
to stable/ocata, and went into the 15.0.6 release. However,
in ocata the minimum required version of libvirt is 1.2.1, so
it's possible people could be running libvirt in ocata with
libvirt < 1.2.9 which would then result in an AttributeError
if doing a swap volume operation on a block type device.

This adds a check to see if the attribute exists before attempting
to use it.

Note that this change is not made on the master branch since starting
in Pike the minimum required version of libvirt is 1.2.9.

This change adds a new 'allocations' kwarg to the
nova.virt.driver.ComputeDriver.spawn method and its overrides.  The
value is the 'allocations' member of the dict returned from GET
/allocations/{instance_uuid}, representing the resources allocated to
the instance from the scheduler via placement.

This provides the virt driver with a way to know exactly which inventory
has been allocated to an instance by placement, from which resource
providers.  Previously, virt drivers would process the flavor to glean
this information.  This works fine as long as there's one monolithic
resource provider - the compute host - providing all the inventory in
a known fashion.  However, as we expand to using nested and shared
resource providers, it becomes necessary for the virt driver to know
that e.g. CPU inventory has been allocated from a specific NUMA node; or
e.g. an SR-IOV VF has been allocated from a specific PF.  Placement
allows such allocations to be represented generically; this change
is how virt is made aware of the same.

Our linters job relies on the presence of the 'openstack-ansible-tests'
repository, so it is better for us to rely on a child of the upstream
linters job in which we can specify the additional repo. This saves
having to do more adjustments in project-config in the future too.

A series of patches has been proposed to all OSA repositories to
replace these jobs with our own linters job.

This reverts commit 62001adadb2efc27bd3ae7ea5a8c10fcc623e69b.

With https://review.openstack.org/#/c/511509 we start erroring out

http://logs.openstack.org/09/511509/7/check/legacy-tripleo-ci-centos-7-undercloud-containers/5d3fecc/logs/var/log/undercloud_install.txt.gz

Reason for this is that we include the tripleo::base::tuned profile which has:
  exec { 'tuned-adm':
    path => ['/bin', '/usr/bin', '/sbin', '/usr/sbin'],
    command => ""tuned-adm profile ${profile}"",
    unless => ""tuned-adm active | grep -q '${profile}'""
  }

So if the tuned package is not installed by other means we get:
""Error: /Stage[main]/Tripleo::Profile::Base::Tuned/Exec[tuned-adm]: Could not evaluate: Could not find command 'tuned-adm'"",

Let's add the package here in the profile instead of installing it
via tripleo.sh, that way also a split stack deployment is covered.

Currently when authenticating the default response is to return the full
service catalog. In many cases, clients only care about the endpoints for a
single service and a single region, so we could save time and compute power by
only retrieving/returning the information the client cares about. Accordingly
the proposal is to add optional arguments to indicate the service-type and/or
region of interest, and these would be used to limit the catalog returned in
the response.

Ceph commands the Ceph check runs to query cluster status need to access
/etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring. To that end one can either add
monasca-agent to the ceph group or run monasca-agent as root. This
commit adds the use_sudo configuration option that runs ceph commands
using sudo. This is useful if your agent has sudo rights anyway due to
other plugins that require it (e.g. postfix).

Devstack and our gate will only install and run tempest from the master
branch.  Any stable project release that has in-tree tempest tests and
relies on certain tempest functions becomes fragile as tempest is a
moving target.

Commit 52d7b0d62600b24f516070a4cc5f4194d5cffc76 renamed a
project-dependent function for several projects, specifically glance and
cinder.  An example can be seen here:

  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/417329/

Reverting the change would break other projects that have already been
updated and updating the stable branch in cinder would allow the gate to
pass (since we only run master) but would break third parties.

This patch adds the necessary functions to allow the voting jobs to pass
for stable backports.

1. Increase the timeout for agent calls.

3. Fix test case exception handling
Under 9ec134996a1162de0d74ef915dc138bbacbcfdf1 the
exception that failed test cases was raised with a bare
'raise' to preserve the original traceback. This introduced
another issue where log reporting in the exception block
could fail and that exception would be raised.
This fixes the exception handling to preserve the original
traceback and prevent exceptions in error handling being
raised.

timeout trying to list the network interfaces [1].

When bug 1709902 was fixed in I0df401a7c91f012fdb25cb0e6b344ca51de8c309
the fix assumed that when the _destroy_evacuated_instances() is called
during the init of the nova-compute service the resource tracker
already knows the compute node ids associated to the given compute
host. This is not true and therefore _destroy_evacuated_instances fails
with and exception and does not clean up the evacuated instance.

The resource tracker's compute_nodes dict only initalized during the
first update_available_resource call that happens in the
pre_start_hook. While the _destroy_evacuate_instances called from
init_host which is called before the pre_hook_start.
The _destroy_evacuated_instances call uses the
_delete_allocation_for_moved_instance that relies on the resource
tracker's compute_nodes dict.

This patch inlines _delete_allocation_for_moved_instance in
_destroy_evacuated_instances and queries the db for the compute node
uuid. As ironic uses 1:M host:node setup we cannot ask the db only once
about the node uuid as different instances might be on different nodes.

The ""serial console"" feature is a non-graphical interactive console
to an instance. The testing gap for this feature resulted in some breaks
in the past.
This change introduces a hook into the live-migration test job which
configures the testing nodes to enable Tempest tests for instances with
a serial console. After the tempest tests are run, the default config
option values get restored.

Tempest commit 69d58b8 introduced the test for the serial console which
gets invoked with this hook.

This changes the a-r-r with the proper version, and fixes
the repo path for role upgrades:

The role will, during test-upgrade-pre, have its current branch
checked out, and will deploy the current branch infrastructure,
including the generation of the constraints.

Then, the installation of previous branch of the role will use
the constraints for its previous version, but will have no
constraints for it, and fail.

We need to generate the constraints for the previous version too.
This should do it.

The cleanup assist mecanism is introduced to handle the
case where at stop/cleanup time, a dataplane driver has
no simple mean to remove all the states it has created
in the dataplane.

We enhance VPNInstance and TrackerWorker so that, on stop(),
if the dataplane driver requires it, we simulate the withdrawal
of all received routes.

This is *not* done based on the unsubscribe mechanism, because
doing so would run into the problem of having to identify the
moment where all routes have been withdrawn, which the
RouteTableManager does not support.

This enhancement is used by the EVPN/VXLAN linux driver for the
cases where the vxlan interface is not created by the driver, but
reused from another component, making it impossible to remove
all dataplane states by removing the vxlan interface.

This change also replace the VPNInstance Lock with an RLock
which really is the kind of Lock we need.

With this change, the following happens when a VXLAN network is
associated to an L2 BGPVPN: bagpipe-bgp will be given, as a VNI
to use for the EVPN, the VNI of the network.  This currently applies
to linuxbridge only (no EVPN OVS driver yet).

Additionally, the behavior of bagpipe-bgp EVPN/VXLAN driver is modified
so that whenever a VXLAN interface with the target VNI already exists
on the bridge for a given EVPN, this interface will be reused.

The result is that when a VXLAN network is associated to an L2 BGPVPN,
the VNI of the network will be used for EVPN and the VXLAN interface
of the bridge for this network will be reused, avoiding tricky questions
that would be raised if two vxlan interfaces were used on that bridge.

To make this possible, changes were brought around agent extensions to
adadpt to the fact that the VNI of a network is known by our extension
at handle_port time, which may be after the reception of the
bgpvpn_port_attach RPC.

In before, only one binding driver is allowed. This patch introduces
a new config to support multiple binding drivers. The first use case
is to allow SR-IOV binding to be co-existed with other binding.

* Rename the config 'driver' to 'default_driver' in 'binding' group.
  This is for making it clear that it is allowed to have more than
  one type of bindings.
* Introduce a new config called 'enabled_drivers'.
* Allow client to pass a driver name to port_bind and port_unbind.
  If this parameter is None, kuryr will load the default driver.

Glance returns pagination links like ""/v2/images?marker="". keystoneauth
Adapter treats absolute links like that as if they are rooted on the
service url. Since the catalog has https://image.example.com/v2 in it,
the Adapter will be mounted on that, which means /v2/images will be
treated as ""https://image.example.com/v2/v2/iamges - which is not
correct.

Doing a urljoin would also be incorrect in an OpenStack context, because
the service could be on a sub-url, such as https://example.com/image,
meaning the v2 API endpoint would be https://example.com/image/v2 -
which means a straight urljoin of https://example.com/image/v2 and
/v2/images?marker= would result in https://example.com/v2/images?marker=
which is wrong since it strips the /image path prefix.

The most correct things for glance to do would be to return a full
absolute url - or a full relative URL. Constructing the absolute url
shade-side is hard for the above reasons - we don't have the right
context.

Strip /v1/ or /v2/ from the front of the next links (yay!) to turn
it into a relative url - thereby letting adapter.get(endpoint) do the
correct thing.

While doing this, update the catalog fixture in the test suite to have a
trailing /v2 so that we can be sure we're doing the correct thing in our
unit tests. Also add suburl fixtures to ensure that we work with
suburls.

It will depend on a mistral change which will get the
ansible update_task and run it via mistral

  - the stack update command which will make an automatic minor
    upgrade (or just upgrade a given set of nodes)
  - running it manually via ansible on the undercloud

Glare (from GLare Artifact REpository) is a service that provides
access to a unified catalog of structured meta-information as well
as related binary data (these structures are also called 'artifacts').

Glare aims to create a unified repository of artifacts for all types of
data, because currently in OpenStack there is no service that addresses
issues of data immutability, versioning of artifacts, and offers a
convenient means of storing and searching.

A key feature of the service is the ability to manage different
artifacts of various nature: containers, VNF packages,
database backups, heat templates, and so on. At the same time, no matter
what type of artifact is used - Glare always provides a single universal
API for working with them.
In addition Glare offers plenty innovative, user friendly features:
 * Artifact versioning in SemVer format.
 * Multiple binary objects per entity.
 * Dependencies between artifacts.
 * Advanced sorting and filtering with various operators.
 * Micro version API support.
 * Asynchronous data processing and validation.
 * Zero downtime database upgrades.
And many more!

The service was presented in Barcelona Summit[1], as well as in demos
at various design sessions.
Glare API and architecture are well documented [2][3].

Glare project strictly follows the Four Opens suggested by OpenStack
Foundation. Glare code has been developed under an Apache 2.0 license.
Bugs are filed, reviewed and tracked in Launchpad [4]. New patches are
submitted and reviewed through OpenStack Gerrit and the project core
team checks all the changes before merging them.

Glare is implemented using libraries and technologies adopted by
OpenStack community such as SQLAlchemy for database interractions,
oslo.versionedobjects for declaring new artifact types, glance_store
for communication with various cloud stores, and many others.
The project obeys the coordinated interfaces, including tox, pbr,
global-requirements, and so on. Glare gate now runs pep8, py27, py35,
and docs tasks.

Glare has devstack plugin and required tempest test infrastructure.
Glare client provides a cli plugin for openstack client named
'openstack artifact'.

Project team has been using openstack-dev mailing list and freenode IRC
channel #openstack-glare heavily for cooperation.

In conclusion, Glare fills a real need in OpenStack. Glare offers new
advanced flexible catalog that can support various artifact type
structures, which is currently lacking in OpenStack.
As Glare enhances OpenStack capabilities, raises a lot of interest in
the community, and is developed by OpenStack standards, we believe it
should become an Official Project!

When sending notifications about an instance, it's possible the
notification payload will have attributes not already loaded on
the instance. In this case, a lazy-load will happen and if the
load method needs to lookup the instance (example: in the
_check_instance_exists_in_project method in the DB layer), the
InstanceNotFound exception will be raised and the notification
will fail to be sent.

This targets the instance context to the instance's cell when
calling the send notification method.

Add new relation to support bootstrapping a new deployment
of the ceph-mon charm from an existing ceph charm deployment,
supporting migration away from the deprecated ceph charm.

Each member of the existing ceph application will present
the required fsid and monitor-secret values, as well as its
public address so that the related ceph-mon units can
correctly seed from the exisitng MON cluster.

Provide stop hook implementation, which will leaves OSD
services running but will remove the ceph.conf provided
directly from this charm, falling back to ceph.conf provided
by other charms installed on the same machine. MON and MGR
services will be shutdown and disabled.

This changes the a-r-r with the proper version, and fixes
the repo path for role upgrades:

The role will, during test-upgrade-pre, have its current branch
checked out, and will deploy the current branch infrastructure,
including the generation of the constraints.

Then, the installation of previous branch of the role will use
the constraints for its previous version, but will have no
constraints for it, and fail.

We need to generate the constraints for the previous version too.
This should do it.

On top of that, we needed to update the work for Zuul v3:
This implements the initial OSA zuul v3 role jobs.

This patch implements an initial set of jobs intended to match
the current job execution method. It does not intend to improve
how the jobs are executed - only to replicate what is currently
in openstack-infra/openstack-zuul-jobs and provide the platform
to iterate on.

We install the glance api on all nodes in multinode testing. This has
been failing because we don't configure the glance auth cache dirs if
we only install the glance api service. This was done as part of

Fix this by moving the auth cache dir creation step into
configure_glance which is run for the glance api.

arp_responder should be enabled by default in DVR installation.
Also when arp_responder is enabled, DVR HA migration tempest scenario
tests are consistently passing(Please see my comments in [1]).
Historically this option was introduced just because we were gating on
ubuntu trusty which had ovs 2.0.x and arp responder didn't work there.
With this change, if DVR is enabled for ovs agent then we also enable
arp_responder.

When router interfaces are added to DVR router, if the router has
gateway configured, then the internal csnat ports are created for
the corresponding router interfaces.
We have seen recently after the csnat port is created if the
RouterPort table update fails, there is a DB retry that is happening
and that retry operation is creating an additional csnat port.
This additional port is not getting removed automatically when the
router interfaces are deleted.
This issue is seen when testing with a simple heat template as
per the bug report.

This patch fixes the issue by calling the RouterPort create with
delete_port_on_error context.

When creating an IPv6 auto-address subnet for a network, ports can be
created or updated concurrently in the same network, before the subnet
creation concludes. In such a situation, an IpAddressAlreadyAllocated
exception may be raised, because the subnet create request attempts to
allocate auto addresses to the concurrently created or updated ports,
which have been already allocated by the port requests.

This patchset adds code to the IPAM to skip the attempt to assign the
auto address to ports if they already have received them.

Nova creates a session back to keystone to verify project ids for
quota and flavor access APIs. The session that was being created was
not based on conf options, so it only worked in simple default
scenarios. This updates the session by using the newly added keystone
section to utilize keystoneauth1 to manage the session creation, which

Under zuulv3 the behavior has changed significantly to now require
specifying which repositories need to be cloned for each job, and
zuul-cloner only copies the repositories that are already
available. As soon as zuulv3 is released, our jobs relying on the old
fallback behavior of checking out from a cache when present but using
the upstream server in other situations will fail.

The new script clone_repo.sh handles the cases we have in the
tag-releases job. It is a copy of
openstack/releases/tools/clone_repo.sh from
Ic559d27881a9a89fb0dcb5295a4d7ed7c578112f. The duplication is expected
to be temporary because we want to move the tag-releases job
definition into the releases repository after the milestone.

The other changes update the shared function ""clone_repo"" to call the
script rather than zuul-cloner. This approach was taken to make it
clear that clone_repo.sh is a copy of the original script. The step to
update the list of tags in the local repo is redundant, so that is
also removed.

Meanwhile, on the Instance panel, there are 5 actions need to call the

supported or not. Each call takes about 2ms-3ms. Though it's cached,
it's still taking about 2ms * 5 actions * 20 instances = 0.2 second

signal all pending SoftwareDeployment resources from a stack until the
stack completes.

The idea is to complete the stack without it actually having to apply
SoftwareDeployments to real servers.

""openstack overcloud config download"" could then be used to pull the
playbooks out of Heat for them to be applied out of band, such as with
ansible directly.

Under zuulv3 the behavior has changed significantly to now require
specifying which repositories need to be cloned for each job, and
zuul-cloner only copies the repositories that are already
available. As soon as zuulv3 is released, our jobs relying on the old
fallback behavior of checking out from a cache when present but using
the upstream server in other situations will fail.

The new script tools/clone_repo.sh handles the cases we have in the
tools and jobs within this repository, and should also be usable from
the tag-releases job.

zuul is removed from the list of requirements so it is no longer
installed when jobs run under tox.

list_unreleased_changes.sh is updated to drop the use of the
virtualenv, which was only present for zuul-cloner.

The other updates in the patch are to change the tools to use the new
script.

The port binding:profile handling in _setup_migration_port_profile
and _update_port_binding_for_instance is not handling when the
binding:profile is set on the port but the value is None, which
results in a NoneType error. Neutron API does not define a format
for this field, or whether or not it will be specified on the port,
and if so, if it's an empty dict or None, so let's be safe and
make sure we handle None.

Because of how many places we access the binding:profile on
a port, this adds a common helper utility.

An Opt provides a prompt parameter to indicate that the user can be
prompted for input if the parameter is not provided. As essentially the
reference implementation to the likes of os-client-config the
keystoneauth CLI loading should also handle this parameter.

os-client-config and openstackclient do not use this path instead
providing their own loaders so they will have to implement their own
prompting logic.

called 'dhcp_ignore_unknown_hosts'. When set to
True, any dhcp request from an unknown host will
be ignored rather than replied to with a DHCPNACK.
This is useful for debugging purposes if you are
sharing a subnet and do not want to step on your
peer's DHCP request flow.

When [cinder]cross_az_attach=False (not the default) and doing
boot from volume, the API code validates the BDM by seeing if
the instance and the volume are in the same availability zone.
To get the AZ for the instance, the code is first trying to get
the instance.host value.

In Ocata we stopped creating the instance in the API and moved that
to conductor for cells v2. So the Instance object in this case now
is created in the _provision_instances method and stored in the
BuildRequest object. Since there is no host to set on the instance
yet and the Instance object wasn't populated from DB values, which
before would set the host field on the instance object to None by
default, trying to get instance.host will lazy-load the field and
it blows up with ObjectActionError.

The correct thing to do here is check if the host attribute is set
on the Instance object. There is clear intent to assume host is
not set in the instance since it was using instance.get('host'),
probably from way back in the days when the instance in this case
was a dict. So it's expecting to handle None, but we need to
modernize how that is checked.

Since we used to allow zero-byte last segments but now we don't, it
can be difficult to deal with some old SLO manifests.

Imagine you're writing some code to sync objects from Swift cluster A
to Swift cluster B. You start off with just a GET from A piped into a
PUT to B, and that works great until you hit a SLO manifest and B
won't accept a 500GB object. So, you write some code to detect SLO
manifests, sync their segments, then take the JSON manifest
(?multipart-manifest=get) and sync *that* over.

Now, life is good... until one day you get an exception notification
that there's this manifest on cluster A that cluster B won't
accept. Turns out that, back when Swift would take zero-byte final
segments on SLOs (before commit 7f636a5), someone uploaded such a SLO
to cluster A. Now, however, zero-byte final segments are invalid, so
that SLO that exists over in cluster A can't just be copied to cluster
B.

A little coding later, your sync tool detects zero-byte final segments
and removes them when copying a manifest. But now your ETags don't
match between clusters, so you have to figure out some way to deal
with that, and so you put it in metadata, but then you realize that
your syncer might encounter a SLO which contains a sub-SLO which has a
zero-byte final segment, and it's right about then that you start
thinking about giving up on programming and getting a job as an
elevator mechanic.

This commit makes life easier for developers of such applications by
allowing SLOs to have zero-byte segments again.

In the set_target_cell method, we synchronize access to the cached cell
database transaction context manager objects to prevent more than one
thread from using a cell's transaction context manager at the same
time.

In scatter_gather_cells, we're calling target_cell in such a way that
the lock is acquired and released BEFORE the green thread actually
accesses the database in the spawned function. So multiple threads can
access a cell's database transaction context manager and it's possible
for a database transaction to fail with the error:

  TypeError: Can't upgrade a READER transaction to a WRITER
             mid-transaction

because the in-scope transaction context might be in the middle of a
read when a concurrent green thread tries to do a write.

Some of our consumers define additional members on the context class
that they want included in to_dict and from_dict.  While it is
possible to do this today via overrides of those functions, the
from_dict implementation in particular is a little non-obvious.
This has led to bugs when the base class's to_dict behavior changes.

This change moves the logic around extending the keys recognized by
from_dict into from_dict itself and allows consumers to simply
provide a list of those keys by overriding a class member.

When deleting the rows in batch the DB would try to lock all rows even
if they don't answer the WHERE clause. This would include freshly
inserted rows, which were locked.
This would then cause a deadlock if the inserted row had a dependency on
a row already locked by the cleanup transaction, as the DB tries to low
both entries referenced by the dependeices table's foreign keys.

Deleting the rows one by one avoids this unnecessary complication.

As part of the migration from httblib2 -> urllib3 we lost support for
handling the env vars for setting an http proxy. This wasn't ever an

functionality and it is a useful feature having tempest support this
explicitly will make sure we don't accidentally drop support for it in

This reverts commit 54b360cdd3dc73465d362f2d0b15672d82478e5e.

devstack-plugin-ceph is branchless, which means any changes to master
are used in CI jobs on stable branches, like stable/ocata. The py3
packages for rados and rbd are not available until the Pike UCA, so
the change being reverted effectively breaks and blocks any jobs that
rely on ceph in stable/newton or stable/ocata.

Recently, I noticed in the devstack experimental job
gate-tempest-dsvm-py35-full-devstack-plugin-ceph-ubuntu-xenial-nv that
when Glance runs under python 3, it was unable to import rados and rbd
because the Ceph plugin doesn't install the python 3 packages. This
adds the packages to the list for install.
