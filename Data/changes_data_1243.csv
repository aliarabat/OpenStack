Some default values for configuration options are dynamic and
environment dependent. For example, an option might default to the
hostname of the machine.

However, such default values should never end up in a sample
configuration file - you don't want your hostname or path to your
personal home directory to be included in sample config files.

A simple solution to this is to add a 'sample_default' string
attribute which is used in place of a default, for those cases where
the real value is an unsuitable sample default. For example:

  cfg.StrOpt('hostname',
             default=get_my_host(),
             sample_default='myhostname')

utils test to the test that is used to test
all the various types.

This change presents one way we might include test support
for oslo.db against specific SQLAlchemy major releases, currently
including the 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 series.  As we will want to
begin including features within oslo.db that target advanced
and in some cases semi-public APIs within SQLAlchemy, it will
be important that we test these features against each major release,
as there may be variances between major revs as well as
version-specific approaches within oslo.

To accomplish this, I was not able to override ""deps"" alone,
as the SQLAlchemy revision within requirements.txt conflicts
with a hand-entered requirement, and due to pip's lack of
a dependency resolver (see https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/988
and https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/56) I instead overrode
""commands"".  I don't know that this is the best approach, nor
do I know how the tox.ini file is accommodated by CI servers,
if these CI servers would need their tox invocation altered or
how that works.

This patch may or may not be the way to go, but in any case
I'd like to get input on how we can ensure that more SQLAlchemy-specific
oslo.db features can be tested against multiple SQLAlchemy versions.
Note that even with this change, running the ""sqla_07"" environment
does in fact produce test failures, see http://paste.openstack.org/show/85263/;
so already oslo.db expects behaviors that are not present in
all SQLAlchemy versions listed in the common requirements.txt.

Recently it was observed that with large numbers of volumes
that things like ""cinder list"" could take extremely long to
return.

For example, running cinder list on a system with 1000 volumes took
greater than 30 seconds to return.  It turns out that the cause of
this is the addition of visible admin_metadata.

There's two problems with this:
1. The original patch probably shouldn't have gone in
   data is either admin data or it's not, selectively picking
   pieces of admin data out to provide to the user just creates
   complications and introduces confusion.
2. The REAL issue here is that since the standar gets are made
   with the standard user context, the add_visible_admin_metadata
   would go through and do an elevated context get on every single
   volume individually.  This is what caused the horrible performance
   issue on cinder list with large numbers of volumes.

Running as admin, or removing the second call drops this down to about 3
seconds for the same 1000 volume list.

This patch removes the secondary admin context get_call.  Instead where
we expect to do display the visible admin_meta, we pass in a flag
requesting that the volume object we're getting has the appropriate
metadata.  This way we can elevate the context if needed and avoid
iterating through the gets again.

This patch also cleans up the get_visible_admin_meta methods, and
consolidates both V1 and V2 to use the utils method.

The messagebus service is renamed dbus in Fedora. As such the
instructions have been updated to provide both the RHEL/CentOS

Examples of the service/chkconfig commands were not switched to
systemctl in this change as service/chkconfig remains used
consistently across the guide at this time and works on both
RHEL/CentOS-based and Fedora distributions.

spawn() guards against multiple threads simultaneously attempting to
cache the same image, but it wasn't guarding against them
simultanously trying to create a resized copy in the cache. Attempting
to create a large number of images simultaneously of an uncached image
would result in a race to create the resized image. This resulted in 2
classes of failed instance:

1. Instances whose disk was a linked clone of a copy which had been
   subsequently overwritten. These were corrupt.
2. Instances whose spawn() failed in ExtendVirtualDisk_Task due to a
   locked image.

This patch creates a Nova-local lock for the resized image. The image
is in a per-Nova directory on the datastore, so inter-Nova locking is
not a concern. The lock guards both testing for the existence of the
image, and its creation. Therefore when multiple processes race, only
1 will create the resized copy, and all others will find and use it.
In normal usage this will add the overhead of an additional
uncontended local lock creation and deletion in spawn().

In wrapping this code in a lock, we also make certain that any failure
to create the resized image is appropriately cleaned up. Otherwise
subsequent users will attempt to use a corrupt copy.

To be able to create profiling traces for Keystone, client should be
able to send special HTTP header that contains trace info.
This patch is as well important to be able to make cross project
traces. (Typical case nova calls keystone via python client, if
profiler is initialized in nova, keystone client will add extra
header, that will be parsed by special osprofiler middleware in keystone
api)

Don't worry no security issue here, trace information is signed by HMAC
key that is setted in api-paste.ini. So only person that knows HMAC key
is able to send proper header.

The current structure must be baffling for new template authors.

First is a section on Environments, which is actually an advanced
topic. Then is a section on cfn compatible functions which users
should be spurning in favour of HOT intrinisic functions.

The actual docs on how to write a HOT template and the HOT spec
is buried at the end.

This change remedies this state of affairs by moving the
Heat Orchestration Template (HOT) Guide to the start, followed by
the HOT spec.

The Environments section is now after the resource types, and the
Functions section has been renamed CloudFormation Compatible
Functions.

How we document CloudFormation coverage probably needs to be
rethought, but that is beyond the scope of this change.

Horizon catches and propagates recoverable exceptions back to the
user.  This code previously caught all exceptions and then raised
Exception (with an unhelpful message), which Horizon propagated as an
even less helpful message.  By raising the error as a
novaclient.exception.ClientException, we give Horizon a fighting
chance of passing a useful (but sanitized) error message to the user.

This changes the message the user sees from:

Error: There was an error submitting the form. Please try again.

To:

Error: Unable to modify instance ""test10"".
Error: Failed to modify 1 instance security groups

The error condition can be simulated by trying to modify security
groups on a suspended instance.

The compute manager passes (instance, new_pass) to the
set_admin_password method, and the XenAPI driver impl
expects this pair of parameters. The ComputeManager
class, however, declares that it takes (instance, context,
new_pass=None). It makes no sense to default the new
password to None, when the only caller always passes
it, and the context parameter is never passed by the
caller either.

Cinder currently see each volume backend as a whole, even if the backend
is consists of several smaller pools with totally different capabilities
and capacities.  Such gap can cause 'strange' issue - a backend appears
to have enough capacity to create a copy of a volume but the backend fails
to do so.  Extending Cinder to support storage pools within volume backend
will not only solve issues like that, it can also make Cinder's scheduling
decision smarter as it now knows full set of capabilities of a backend.

This commit removes the resource management code used in the scenario
tests and replaces it with addCleanup. The tearDownClass code created
a LIFO queue for deleting resources created during tests which is
exactly what addCleanup is used for. Additionally, the previous
tearDownClass code only worked for objects created, and couldn't
undo actions such as volume attach which changed the resource state.
addCleanup doesn't have that limitation.

To handle async delete actions a list of waits is added which will be iterated
 over as the last step of clearing the addCleanup queue. That way all the
delete calls are made up front and the tests won't succeed unless the deletes
are eventually successful. This is the same basic approach used in the api
tests to limit cleanup execution time except here it is multi-resource, because
of the nature of the scenario tests.

The hypervisor JSON schemas were not consistent with the value for
disk_available_least. One allowed for 'null' values, but the other
two did not. This allows 'null' in all schemas (Ironic does not
set this value so it will be 'null' when the compute api tests
are run).

This tests showing and updating the 'default' quota class, which is
really all this API is used for. It was removed in Icehouse in part to
not knowing it was used even though python-novaclient and Horizon were
using it. The removal was reverted and this change is to enforce what
the API is used for.

The extension only lives in the Nova v2 API, it was removed in the v3
API in Icehouse.

This change adds new quota client and test classes for the new API.

An external lock fixture is used in all compute API quota tests to
avoid introducing race bugs with the existing tenant-specific
os-quota-sets tests.

For larger images, nova is timing out to boot an
instance from the volume. To fix it, block device
mapping logic is updated to make the timeout value
as configurable from nova.conf. By default its
set to 180 seconds as earlier.

DocImpact
/etc/nova/nova.conf is updated with following
variables:
block_device_mapping_timeout - Maximum number of
seconds to wail for volume creation, while
instance is booted from volume.
block_device_mapping_polling_interval - Number
of seconds to poll for volume creation while
instance is booted from volume

Discovered some tests that were coupling the code under test with the
storage policies configured in /etc/swift/swift.conf.  There was some
tests that created fake rings in their tempdirs, but didn't reset or
patch the POLICIES global.  So if your local config needed more rings
that the fake's were setting up (just 2) the tests would puke when they
loaded up an app that looked for rings.  I think this probably started
happening when we added eager object ring loading back into the proxy.

 * two TestCases in test_wsgi were missing @patch_policies
 * fixed issue with patch_policies that could cause state to bleed
   between tests
 * patch_policies' legacy and default collections get a FakeRing by
   default

 * drive-by cleanup for test_loadapp_proxy() ring serialized path
   handling
 * drive-by cleanup for test_internal_client that was doing basically
   the same thing as test_wsgi

-In FWaaS, administrator can use port range and protocol inside firewall rules
to define traffic type. But we don't have a flexible way to allow user to specify more
than one type of traffic in the same rule.To support different traffic type, with the
same source, destination address and action, different rules need to be created.
This makes the process of defining firewall rules un-scalable.
two resources are added to enhance the FWaaS using the following cli
one is called service group and one is called service object
Administrator can use service object to define a special type of traffic. The service
objects is grouped into service group that can be referenced from other openstack
modules (eg. firewall rule).
Each service object can be defined with a timeout value that can be used to overwrite
default session idle timeout value.

Update the Nova driver's rebuild() to account for changes in the instance image

new image, making it impossible to do image-based upgrades.  This adds logic
to the patcher to account for the preserve_ephemeral flag and updates rebuild()

Using the new logging translation markers (_LI(), _LW(), _LE(),

Openstack guidelines only allow modules to be imported[2], the entire
gettextutils module must imported in order to use the translation
markers.

This patch adds all four markers to import_exceptions in tox.ini, so
they can be imported individually without failing the pep8 tests.  This
is already done with the _() marker.  With this change, it will be
allowable to import marker functions like so:

from ironic.openstack.common.gettextutils import _LI

from ironic.openstack.common.gettextutils import _LE

In looking to clean up excessive DEBUG logging, it became clear
that the logging in ConfigDriveBuilder was largely based on the
split logic that existed in doing fs opts in __init__ and then
also later in make_drive. This required a persistent tempdir, which
had to be manually cleaned up. It also meant a mandatory additional
config variable.

Refactor ConfigDriveBuilder to move all fs opts into make_drive,
deprecating the config variable in the process. In doing so, I don't
believe the previous debug logging is useful any more. However, in
case, add a __repr__ for ConfigDriveBuilder that will provide us with
a reasonable debug representation in case this becomes part of what
gets thrown.

Tests are now adjusted to not call private methods, but instead call
make_drive with config variable set.

When Peter cargo-culted this part from wsgi.py, I consulted Mike
about its origins. Apparently, it was a workaround for a rare
error condition with epoll, which may not even apply anymore,
but nobody dares to risk trying to remove it. IMHO we shold at
least not copy it around any more than necessary.

If we ever see an in-process functest hanging with a lost event,
we should use use_hub('selects') here and not the trickery from
the utils, IMHO again.

The compute manager has been calling get_instance_disk_info on
virt driver implementations during block migration, despite
this method not being declared in the virt driver API. It was
implemented in libvirt and stubbed in xenapi, with different
API signatures in both.

Declare & document it as part of the virt driver API, and
split the libvirt impl into two parts to hide the libvirt
specific notion of XML config.

counting on the the 'X-Backend-Storage-Policy-Index' being set which isn't

Also clean up some test cruft, tighten up the interface on FakeConn, and add

happens while we're refreshing security group rules, we will
not notice this case and re-add stale rules for an old instance,

The config docs have historically recommended that the number of
glance  workers should be set to the number of CPUs available for
best performance, so we should make this the default.

Commit 75c96a48fc7e5dfb59d8258142b01422f81b0253 did the same thing in
Nova in Icehouse and the plan is to do the same thing for Cinder
and Trove workers.

The config files are updated to match the help string in the code.

There is no upgrade impact since glance-api.conf previously
hard-coded the workers value to 1 so anyone upgrading to this
will still get whatever value was set in glance-api.conf prior
to this change.

DocImpact: glance workers will now be equal to the number of
           CPUs available by default if not explicitly specified
           in glance-api.conf and/or glance-registry.conf.

UpgradeImpact: There is no upgrade impact to glance-api workers
           since glance-api.conf previously hard-coded the workers
           value to 1 so anyone upgrading to tihs will still get
           whatever value was set in glance-api.conf prior to

           I0cee0d284eef9ce5dcb26720499f2c4d31eaca0f, which is

The metadata_update interface does pretty much the exact same thing
as handle_signal, with the disadvantage that it's not exposed via
the native ReST API, so convert WaitConditionHandle to use
handle_signal.

This has the following advantages:
- Provides a step towards native waitcondition resources
- Enables signalling existing waitcondition resources via
  heat resource-signal (e.g the native API)
- Moves towards a standardized model where handle_signal is the
  only supported plugin interface for asynchronous signalling of
  resources.

To avoid breaking any CD folks who may not update heat-engine and
heat-api-cfn at the same time, the existing resource interface is
maintained with a deprecation warning (how long to maintain this
is TBC).

Previously, sudo-requiring functional tests hardcoded the use of
'sudo' as the root helper.  Devstack gate jobs do not allow
password-less invocation of 'sudo', though, so such tests were unable
to run in the gate.  This patch adds the ability to configure the
rootwrap command installed by devstack by setting the OS_ROOTWRAP_CMD
environment variable in the test execution environment, allowing
sudo-requiring tests to run.

We're hitting races in the gate where the instance.vm_state is STOPPED
but the task_state is POWERING_OFF so when the compute_api.start method
is called, we're in an invalid task state and fail.

The compute manager's stop_instance method is correctly setting the
vm_state to STOPPED and the task_state to None when the instance is
powered off via the virt driver, so we must be hitting this from races
in the ec2 API as noted in the TODO above the method definition.

This change simply checks the task_state in addition to the vm_state
in the wait loop before continuing. The error message is also updated
for context by including the instance uuid, vm_state and task_state,
and removes the timeout value in the message since it was in
milliseconds, not seconds, to begin with.

There is already a unit test that covers this change (which was racing,
hence the bug). There are no changes to that unit test since it's really
an integration test that's running through the compute API and compute
manager code, so the fix tests itself.

Timeout isn't an Exception, so Timeouts in tests weren't getting

Also reorder the test that exposed the failure in the gate so it blows

SELECT FOR UPDATE expression, which is triggered with the use of the
SQLAlchemy Query object's with_lockmode('update') method, is
detrimental to performance and scalability of the database
performance code in Neutron due to the lock contention it produces.

SELECT FOR UPDATE can be entirely avoided in release_segment methods
with the use of single-shot UPDATE and DELETE expressions, and this
patch clears a number of uses of SELECT FOR UPDATE by consolidating
multiple SQL expressions into one.

This patch correct the wrong lock name for operating instance events.
Currently it use function object InstanceEvents._lock_name as the lock
name, the lock name will be like ""<function _lock_name at 0x7fe6a7edec08>"".
So when process the server external event, it will use one lock for all
the events that may belong to different instances. This isn't efficient.
This patch correct it to invoke InstanceEvents._lock_name to get the lock
name as '<instance-uuid>-events'. Then the lock is per instance.

Many place 'id' is defined as both 'string' and 'integer' but not all

For example, servers APIs always return 'server id' as UUID so those
should be defined as 'string' only not {'string', 'integer'} both.
Same applies for other 'id' like in flavor, Image API's response.

Below are the correct type of 'id'-
  Server's id – String

an instance object we can avoid the direct call to conductor for state
changes and just update the instance object directly, which allows us to
remove instance.refresh() in the tests to pick up out-of-band database
updates on instance objects.

This makes the virt.firewall code cleaner in terms of referencing
the cached instance and network_info code it stores. Before this
patch, concurrent instance operations could modify these two dicts
so that while we're iterating instances, the network_info dict
is suddenly missing information we need.

The right fix for this is to use instance objects and their
associated info_cache objects, but that's a larger fix and one
not as well-suited to backporting to previous releases which
suffer from this as well.

The approach taken here is that we store the instance and
network_info cache together in the same dict that we can pop()
from atomically (this is not really necessary, but helps to
prevent introducing more of these cases). When we iterate over
the contents, we iterate over a copy of the keys, being careful
not to let a suddenly-missing key break us, and passing the
details all the way down the stack instead of having deeper calls
hit the cache dicts again.

This patch replaces all datetime objects with utc timestamps in loopingcall.

The rational of using timeutils was disscussed here,
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/16310/1..5/openstack/common/loopingcall.py,cm
which was to use set_time_override to avoid actual time delays in test scripts.
Now that set_time_override is deprecated, we no longer need to use timeutils.

A lambda function returning time.time() was declared due to mock collisions
with time.time() called in the logging module.
Changes to test scripts were made accordingly.
