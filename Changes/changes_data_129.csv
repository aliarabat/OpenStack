In [0] the rebuilding of Keystone endpoint configuration was added
when running the FFWD workflow. However, it was not considered that
the Undercloud upgrade only adds the content for the undercloud stack
in clouds.yaml, being the Overcloud's stack information missing from
the file. This provokes the task to fail while trying to create
the Keystone endpoints, as no cloud matching the cloud's stack name
is found.

This patch anchors the block in charge of generating the clouds.yaml
content during the external_deploy_tasks and calls it in the step 0
so that we ensure the file is ready when executing the post_upgrade
task in step 1.

It doesn't really make since to give up connectimg to the OVN DBs
since we can't do anything without them. If ovsdb-server is slow
and takes more than timeout seconds, everything reconnecting after
partial downloads and starting over is not going to make things
better.

We can change the behavior in ovsdbapp, but doing it without
making non-backportable API changes isn't easily doable.
The plan would be, after merging this back through stable, to
modify ovsdbapp to allow setting different connection and txn
timeouts and being able to disable the timeout in wait_for_change
with a value of -1. Then in the main branch of neutron we can
use that going forward.

When evacuating an instance the evacuation migration record moves from a
state of `accepted` to `pre-migrating` and eventually `done` once the
instance has been rebuilt on the new compute host. At present the
migration record remains in this state until the original compute host
is restarted and the service cleans up any leftovers of the instance
before it is moved to a state of `completed`.

Bug #1922053 details a use case where an operator might unintentionally
forget to ensure the compute service is restarted before forcing the
service up leaving evacuation migration records stuck as `done`.

This could become an issue in the future if the instance is moved back
to this compute before the service is restarted. Any future restart
invoking the cleanup logic and potentially damaging the running
instance.

This change aims to address this by blocking requests to force up
computes associated to `done` evacuation records. Forcing operators to
restart the service allowing them to move to a `completed` state before
the service can be forced up again.

To allow this to be backportable these requests are rejected with a 400
BadRequest return code from the API. A TODO is left to move this to a
409 Conflict during the Xena release under a new microversion.

Finally, some additional functional tests have been updated to ensure
they restart the source compute service of an evacuation before
attempting to force up the service, ensuring any migration records are
marked as completed.

This removes from_sqlalchemy_model and the related object intermediary
representation from get_loabalancers, get_pools, get_listeners,
get_healthmonitors, get_l7policies, get_l7policy_rules,
get_pool_members.
Instead it more directly transforms from the SQLAlchemy model to the
required api dictionary format. Thus this entierly skips loading a few
relations that walking the intermediary object model triggered without
the target output needing them.

Use eager loading specified at query time where the api dictionary
representation is needed, as the relations needed for it are always the
same.

Removes eager loading from the model of the relations
L7Policy[rules]->L7Rule[policy] and
Listener[l7_policies]->L7Policy[listener] and
Listener[default_pool]->PoolV2[listeners].

These relations are sometimes unncessarily loaded and then never used.
E.g. the API dictionary format for loadbalancers does include policies
but not rules; does include listeners but not any L7Policy.

In a test with a bit more than 100 LBs this improved the speed of a cli
call of lbaas-loadbalancer-list from 50.932s to 2.335s. It similarly
improved lbaas-pool-list and lbaas-listener-list,
lbaas-healthmonitor-list, lbaas-l7policy-list, lbaas-l7rule-list,
lbaas-member-list.

We generate some parameters using the user environments like
the one for image parameters. However, user environments may
have parameters to override some of those. Make sure the ones
in user environments takes precedence by adding the user
environments at the end.

Additional changes:

- Refactors to use the correct image for ephemeral heat
- Removes ntp server check as we never checked for
  ControllerCount in all environment files and also use
  a hard-coded role name.

The ceph cluster degrades to HEALTH_{WARN|CRIT} when the following
default thresholds are breached:

mon data avail warn = 30
mon data avail crit = 5

- These thresholds can be conservative. It might be desirable
  to change them.
- A specific common scenario is when ceph-mon units are run in lxd
  containers which report the disk usage of the underlying host. The
  underlying host may have its own monitoring and its own
  thresholds which can lead to duplicate or conflicting alerts.

changes have been submitted towards this goal including but not limted
to:

* Moving the OVN module to DevStack:

* Updating the OVN module to use distro packages instead of compiling
  OVN from source: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/devstack/+/763402o

``human`` format parsing introduced many issue in the past.

Each time qemu will update it's human format output we could be
impacted by their changes and it could introduce new issues on
oslo.utils.

Human format is a human readable format which need to be parsed by
regexes, in other words it's not really a format that machine can
consume natively.

Qemu introduced json output since version 1.3 [1] and this format is
machine readable, for the sake of stability on oslo.utils we decided to
drop the support of the human format and to use json as the unique and
only supported format.

We will reach our goal by following this scenario:
step 1: deprecate the human format
step 2: remove the human format and deprecate the format parameters
step 3: remove the parameter (json all the time)

These changes deprecate the ``human`` format (step 1)

Previously a commit[1] introduced a new way of doing backup, using
""snapshots"", that do not require to bring down the whole controller to
take the backup. On that commit, the old way was removed, which do not
follow the deprecation procedure.

This commits reintroduces the old way of performing backups via stopping
the controllers and move the snapshots feature to an optional,
user-selected feature.

If we're in the process of handling a KuryrLoadBalancer event and
somebody's tries to delete the `.status` field there, any update we do
on `.status` will result in 422 Unprocessable Entity returned from K8s
API. There's no sense in failing kuryr-controller in that case as the
update should trigger another event and Kuryr should be able to recover
by discovering all the resources and filling the status again.

This commit fixes that by making sure in such situation we stop
processing the event and make the handler wait for the next one.

As a consuequence KLB's 404 returned from patch operations is also
handled as hard stop for further processing of the KuryrLoadBalancer as
there's no point in creating or deleting Octavia resources if the LB is
destined to be cascade deleted.

Currently to get LetsEncrypt certificate, we spawn python http server for 5 seconds to get haproxy endpoint up and after it's terminated, we run certbot which is a backend for this endpoint.

With current haproxy backend settings(inter=2000,fall=2), certbot has only 4 seconds for certificate validation which is too short in many cases.

Changing backend_fall from 2 to 5 should solve the problem.

There has been one confirmed denial-of-service against the opendev
git servers due to an openstack-ansible deployment failing to
correctly use cached wheels from the repo server and instead clone
and build the source code for each openstack service on each target
host.

Whilst we wait for further information to understand the root cause
of that DOS, it is possible to adjust the user-agent that git uses
on a per-domain basis.

A previous patch [1] creates a user-agent string very early during
the setup of a deployment host, or all-in-one environment, but not
any other nodes in a multinode environment. This patch addresses
creating /etc/gitconfig for all hosts in a multinode environment.

If git is not installed on a host (which would be the default state
for hosts other than the deploy host and repo server) a placeholder
/etc/gitconfig is written in case later in the deployment the
python_venv_build role installs git and clones openstack services
from source code to install into a venv without use of the repo
server container. The repo server should normally clone once for
each service deployed for the whole environment.

The user-agent, where possible, contains the git version string,
the openstack-ansible version string and the OSA 'component' to
aid understanding traffic patterns seen at the opendev.org git servers.

this is no longer necessary as we are not using handlers. Additionally
using handlers is no longer recommended with tripleo_free.

Disable the facts gathering in the playbook used
to apply network configuration to provisioned

In some cases the fact gatehereing step causes
the playbook to fail in case the node is just
booting and connection is refused for SSH.

Disabling the facts gathering should also speed up

This is just a random hack that can send a single frag resp back to
ssync if we happen to find missing frag in question.

What's cool about it is, with the new parent patch that allows the ring to
keep track of the last primaries, it now adds the last node, if it
exists, to the list of primary nodes. So on a rebalance _or_ if we're
running duplication factor we may not need to do a full rebuild at all.

No doubt it'll need more checks then this.. this is just an example.

Lower-constraints is not a requirement of the OpenStack Python PTI
[0] and there currently is a discussion on the mailing list [1]
about dropping the test, with the oslo team already having done
so [2].

The new dependency resolver in pip fails due to incompatible
dependency versions in our lower-constraints file, meaning that
we were never providing any real guarantees with it.

To unblock the CI, I am disabling lower-constraints job for now,
with the option to reenable it in case we fix the constraints,
and based on the outcome of the mailing list discussions and
consensus.

If external connectivity fails, it is important that internal

enter the fault state despite internal connectivity being

This patch splits the ping checks to allow deployments to define
a separate ping check for internal and external connectivity to
ensure that when one instance fails the other VIP remains in
operation.

""igmp_snooping_enable"" config option which can be set for
neutron-ovs-agent.
Patch [1] added support for it in puppet-neutron module.
In patch [2] support to enable this option for ML2/OVN backend
was added but we missed same change for ML2/OVS. Now we will
have it too.

Added an active wait in the method ""Backend.lookup"". If a timeout
and a RowEventHandler instance, listening on the same IDL connection,
are passed, if the ""lookup"" method does not find the requested
register, the method creates a WaitEvent instance related to the
table and register requested.

If the wait event returns, the expected record will be stored in the
event ""result"" member and will be the value returned by this method.

If the wait event timeout expires, the method will throw an
``idlutils.RowNotFound`` exception.

--path-as-is is not supported by older versions of curl (prior to
7.42.0) so the curl commands printed by swift-get-nodes must cut,
pasted *and then edited* before they can be run with older
curl. Moving the option to the end of the command line makes it
possible to just cut (omitting the last option) and paste the
commands.

Note: the --path-as-is option is not dropped altogether based on
testing the curl version available because the host on which
swift-get-nodes is executed might have a different curl version to the
host on which the curl command is to be executed. The presence of the
option also serves as a reminder that it (and newer curl) might be
needed with some paths.

Previously, the ContainerBroker get_own_shard_range method always
updated the returned shard range's metadata, requiring a DB query
during every call. However, the returned shard range was often not
required to have up-to-date metadata, for example when only its bounds
were used by the caller.

Now the get_own_shard_range method will only update metadata when the
optional update_meta argument is set True, and by default metadata is
not updated.

In order to broadly cover the issue described in the referred bug,
this patch sets a default timeout of 2 seconds in the
``ovs_idl.Backend.lookup`` method.

This timeout should cover most of the situations where the IDL local
cache update is delayed. This patch does not change the default
behavior, except it will not fail if the DB cache is synchronized
within 2 seconds.

If we don't pass the notify handler or the backend does not implement
one, in case of not finding the requested register, the method will
raise like before.

With an existing kayobe virtualenv from a previous release as used in
upgrade jobs, running `pip install -U ""${KAYOBE_SOURCE_PATH}""` only
updates dependencies when they don't match requirements at all anymore.
Since we generally support two Ansible release series, this can leave
Ansible unchanged.

For example, Victoria requires ansible>=2.8.0,<2.10.0 while Wallaby
requires ansible>=2.9.0,<2.11.0. An overcloud upgrade job starting with
Victoria would have installed ansible 2.9.x, which wouldn't be updated
when upgrading to Wallaby. This means the upgrade-specific code doesn't
get tested with the latest supported Ansible (2.10.x in this case).

Adding `-r requirements.txt` to the pip command prompts it to update any
dependency to the latest supported version.

The way we create tasks is based on configured roles via roles data and
services enabled. Because the actual node count can be 0 which would
result in the role missing from the ansible inventory, we need to check
that the group is in the inventory prior to trying to call it.  This
attempts to skip the task if the role is not in the ansible groups.

A heat plugin to replace a number of resources in
THT/common/services/role.role.j2.yaml.

27 resources in the common services template all iterate
over ServiceChain->role_data using yaql expressions to
process parts of the data.

This heat-plugin replaces all of these heat resources
with one resource to combine all the service data for the
role in one iteration. The plugin is slightly more
efficient, shaving ~1 minute of both stack create and
stack update actions on my test env.

Using plugin:
 Create --stack-only 1x ctlr + 1x cmp:  9m57.921s

This has a few different benefits:

* When re-running the relinker, we won't try to rehash partitions
  outside the expanded range.
* When running on a small, sparse cluster (like in dev or testing) we
  won't try to rehash an empty new partition.
* If we find old files from an earlier part power increase and link them
  into the correct partition, we'll rehash the one we actually linked
  to.
* If we relink a file during cleanup that was missed during relink,
  we'll rehash it rather than waiting for the replicator to do it.

Get ahead of the issue by replacing the dashes with underscores. Without

To improve the usability for those who are not familiar with
microversion, this patch adds microversion negotiation to pick up max
microversion supported both by client and by server.

This negotiation is enabled by specifying only major api version,
``--os-placement-api-version 1``. Note that the default microversion
remains to be ``1.0`` in this patch and will be switched to the
negotiated version in the following patch.

If the reconstructor finds a fragment that appears to be stale then it
will now quarantine the fragment.  Fragments are considered stale if
insufficient fragments at the same timestamp can be found to rebuild
missing fragments, and the number found is less than or equal to a new
reconstructor 'quarantine_threshold' config option.

Before quarantining a fragment the reconstructor will attempt to fetch
fragments from handoff nodes in addition to the usual primary nodes.
The handoff requests are limited by a new 'request_node_count'
config option.

'quarantine_threshold' defaults to zero i.e. no fragments will be
quarantined. 'request node count' defaults to '2 * replicas'.

Awhile back, change I25baf5edd25d9e551686b7ed317a63fd778be533 moved
rbd_utils out from the libvirt driver and into a central location under
nova/storage. This move missed adding a __init__.py file under
nova/tests/unit/storage, so unit test discovery wasn't picking up the
rbd_utils tests and couldn't run them.

This adds a __init__.py file under nova/tests/unit/storage to get the
tests running again.

This also fixes a small bug introduced by change
I3032bbe6bd2d6acc9ba0f0cac4d00ed4b4464ceb in RbdTestCase.setUp() that
passed nonexistent self.images_rbd_pool to self.flags. It should be
self.rbd_pool.

Overcloud upgrade jobs often fail when running on nodes with a 38G root
disk. The overcloud upgrade itself generally works, but post-upgrade
testing fails, for example when RabbitMQ gets in alarm state due to lack
of free disk space, which prevents Nova from functioning correctly and
makes it return ""Unknown Error (HTTP 504)"".

RHEL-8.3 kernel disabled the Intel “TSX” (Transactional
Synchronization Extensions) feature by default as a preemptive
security measure, but it breaks live migration from RHEL-7.9
(or even RHEL-8.1 or RHEL-8.2) to RHEL-8.3.

Scenarios where we need to act:
1. Upgrade OSP13 => OSP16.2
On the leap upgrade of the compute node to RHEL 8.3
if tsx=off already in kernel ARGS, don't do anything
enable TSX on computes which have CPU flags hle|rtm

2. Update from OSP16.1 => OSP16.2
If tsx=off already in KernelArgs, don't do anything.

3. OSP 16.2 new deployments
Explicitely disable tsx on new deployments starting with OSP16.2/RHEL8.4.
If a customer want to have tsx enabled it needs to be switched on via THT.

4. OSP16.1 new deployments
We need to force tsx=off, unless explicitly enabled

Update/Upgrade scenarios
If no tsx flag is added by operator, we enable it by default if the cpu
supports it. This is to prevent live-migration failures. If the node was
already deployed, (by looking for the presence of nova.conf), we defer
reboot to the operator to prevent any unexpected reboots.

Nova bug documented here: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1921070

Side note on automation:
- We believe it's important to automate this part.
- Operators have already tons of things to think and configure
- Most of them don't care about TSX
- If we fail with a warning telling them to define TSX manually when
  it's not defined, they will spend multiple hours trying to wrap
  their head around this.

We currently only validate the existence of a project on
the default types code so that we cannot set it for non
existing projects, but there are other places where we would
benefit from having this validation, such as volume type access,
setting quotas.
To achieve this we are moving methods from quota_utils and default_types
to api_utils.
This patch also modifies the method get_project_hierarchy to get_project
and removes related hierarchy tests since with the removal of nested quota
driver we don't require the hierarchy properties anymore.

This will not work when an operator wants to upgrades from osp-16.1 to
osp-16.2:
16.2 is targeting rhel-8.4 with container-tools:3.0, providing a newer
podman version.

During the upgrade process, we end in a state where we're still running
rhel-8.2, with container-tools:3.0 enabled - leading to an issue when it
comes to the podman version we can get.

Removing this file (and backporting this change down to stable/train)
will allow a swift and smooth fix.

As a last word, this ""last security"" isn't that useful anymore, since we
have a task that ensures we have the correct module stream[1][2].

SRIOVMigration adds two new test methods
test_sriov_direct_live_migration and test_sriov_macvtap_live_migration
which follow the exact same procedure but use different port types,
direct and macvtap respectively.

Tests creates a server, migrates it to a new host, confirms the xml
parameters describing the port correct, and the number of allocated
pci_devices in the pci_devices database table is accurate. It then
migrates the servers back to the source host and rechecks the same set
of criteria.

In case of hairpin LB traffic (member of the LB calls the LB and the

allowed.

To fix that this commit makes sure that SGs used for NPs include ingress
rules for each of the Service in it's namespace. It's not ideal but
seems to be a fair compromise between opening as little traffic as
possible and increasing number of security groups and rules.

As this commit makes sure all the NPs in the namespaces are reanalyzed

support that are also made.

pyroute2 has a curious way of reporting details of RuntimeError raised
when an IPDB transaction fails - it just sets the .debug property of the
exception to a dictionary containing additional info. This is not
printed by default, meaning that we end up with ambiguous RuntimeError
in the logs when anything wrong happens.

This commit improves this by making sure we print traceback included in
that additional info.
