[Spectrum Virtualize Family] check_vdisk_fc_mappings is not deleting
clone fc maps, if the flashcopy status is in copying autodelete is set
to on and copy progress is 100%. when multiple clones and snapshots
are created using common source volume, deleting the source volume
is not removing all the fcmaps involved in mapping with source volume.

This patch fixes the issue by removing the clone fcmap and then
removing the snapshot fcmap when the source has more than one fcmap.

The current start logic when existing cluster state is reboot can
lead to a split brain condition under certain circumstances.  This
patchset adds some additional step to ensure cluster is set to
live state once leader node is ready to start, instead of relying
on slave nodes to handle.  Also add some simple retry when there

The existing hair-trigger that will put the cluster state from
""live"" into ""reboot"" can use some fine tuning, but updating it
properly should require additional investigation and testing,
hence should be done as a separate activity outside the scope
of this patchset.

The current code looks at a hash ring node's created_at/updated_at
fields and tries to determine whether the node has been updated
based on whether updated_at - created_at > 1 second (due to the
method that initially fills them being different by microseconds).
Unfortunately, due to the notify() method being called which calls
the hash ring node's touch_node(), a node can be updated in under
a second, meaning we will prevent caching for much longer than
we intend.

When using sqlite in-memory db, this continually re-creating the
Hash Ring objects for every event that is processed is exposing an
issue where rows that should be in the db just *aren't*.

This patch instead limits the hash ring nodes to api workers and
prevents caching only until the number of nodes == number of api
workers on the host. The switch from spawning hash ring nodes
where !is_maintenance to is_api_worker is primarily because it
seems to be difficult to get a list of *all* workers from which to
subtract the maintenance worker so that _wait_startup_before_caching
can wait for that specific number of workers. In practice, this
means that RpcWorker and ServiceWorker workers would not process
HashRing events.

A note on bug 1903008: While this change will greatly reduce the
likelihood of this issue taking place, we still have some work to
do in order to fully understand why it rubs the database backend
in the wrong way. Thus, we will make this change 'related to'
instead of closing the bug.

When
https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/python-tripleoclient/+/775302
merged, it changed the function signature of
utils.archive_deploy_artifacts, but the tripleo deploy code was not
updated to pass the right arguments. This caused the templates directory
to be considered the working directory and the artifact tarball was
generated in that directory, and then promptly deleted during the
cleanup phase.

This patch updates tripleo deploy to pass the right arguments to
archive_deploy_artifacts, and also use a consistent working directory
based on the stack name under ~/tripleo-deploy instead of defaulting to
the home dir. This is a cleaner approach than just leaving all the files
in the home dir, especially given that tripleo deploy can deploy
multiple stacks, and if the same directory was used as the default,
there would be file collisions.

There has been one confirmed denial-of-service against the opendev
git servers due to an openstack-ansible deployment failing to
correctly use cached wheels from the repo server and instead clone
and build the source code for each openstack service on each target
host.

Whilst we wait for further information to understand the root cause
of that DOS, it is possible to adjust the user-agent that git uses
on a per-domain basis.

This patch sets the user-agent to a string which identifies that
OSA is responsible for git operations, which version of OSA is
in use, and if the host is a deploy host or an AIO build.

Currently from the relinker cli we allow a --workers parameter but it
currently _must_ be an int. However, if someone wants to override a
static int worker value from the config back to the 'auto' this results
in a VALUE error.

This patch changes the argparse type check for the worker param to use
config_auto_int_value, via a small shim, so a value of 'auto' will be

This reverts commit 9437ea74f2086fd5567e2468461ce2e3f9268a27.

Reason for revert: this opened a gap in osp testing where we now have to be explicit for osp releases.. which has caused many skipped tests to execute.

Currently environments/services/undercloud-keepalived.yaml is included
when undercloud SSL is enabled but this file is no longer effective
since the Keepalived service was removed from undercloud role data[1].

[1] c712355e4bae4ef2fc1b83e5603c0364dbd50a78

Because VIPs are managed by os-net-config now and we don't expect any
situation where users requires keepalived running in undercloud,
this change simply removes all remaining implementation for undercloud
keepalived service.

We generate some parameters using the user environments like
the one for image parameters. However, user environments may
have parameters to override some of those. Make sure the ones
in user environments takes precedence by adding the user
environments at the end.

Additional changes:

- Refactors to use the correct image for ephemeral heat
- Removes ntp server check as we never checked for
  ControllerCount in all environment files and also use
  a hard-coded role name.

bintray is being shut down 1st of May 2021, rabbitmq docs direct

For Victoria and below, includes I6a3ba599af3deedd450b4ffff6b86a0c04628340
(base: drop Linaro OBS key for CentOS and Ubuntu)

For Train, fixes also the order of rpm gpg key imports and
yum operations (otherwise CentOS 8 [with dnf] fails because repos
are enabled early and keys are missing).
And it also pins erlang version where required.

This is because systemctl try-restart 'epmd@*' will try to operate on
units from the old rabbitmq package that are still lingering around.
Let's call systemctl daemon-reload before the try-restart.
And also tell systemd to stop those epmd services for extra robustness,
as we really really want those services to be stopped.
We also stop/disable the epmd@0.0.0.0.socket explicitely as it is a remnant of
the old rabbit and is not used with newer version. In any case it gets
recreated by the rabbitmq-server.service

The behavior when a bootable iso is provided behind an http server is
to download and serve the image from the conductor; the image is
removed only when the node is undeployed.
In certain cases, for example on large deployments, this could cause
undesired behaviors, like the conductor nodes running out of disk storage.
We provide an option to avoid this event directly using the original url of
the bootable iso that is then served directly by the external http server

From time to time we see unit test
test_do_cleanup_not_cleaning_already_claimed_by_us failing at the gate
with error:

    testtools.matchers._impl.MismatchError: 1 != 0

This happens because the test was assuming that the machine running the
code would get different times in consecutive utcnow() calls, which
sometimes is not the case if the machine is fast.

The places where the call is expected to have different values are:

- When the test assigns original_time
- When the test assigns other_thread_claimed_time
- When cinder.manager.CleanableManager.do_cleanup assigns until

This patch fixes this issue by simulating that:

- worker1 entry was created in the past (original_time is T-1)

- db's worker_get_all is mocked to simulate that worker2 entry was
  created in the past (T-1)

- simulate that another thread has picked up the worker2 entry by
  writing a newer time in the DB (other_thread_claimed_time)

- making sure that the do_cleanup method uses a time between these two
  (T)

This way we will no longer rely on the values returned by utcnow().

From time to time we see unit test
test_do_cleanup_not_cleaning_already_claimed_by_us failing at the gate
with error:

    testtools.matchers._impl.MismatchError: 1 != 0

This happens because the test was assuming that the machine running the
code would get different times in consecutive utcnow() calls, which
sometimes is not the case if the machine is fast.

The places where the call is expected to have different values are:

- When the test assigns original_time
- When the test assigns other_thread_claimed_time
- When cinder.manager.CleanableManager.do_cleanup assigns until

This patch fixes this issue by simulating that:

- worker1 entry was created in the past (original_time is T-1)

- db's worker_get_all is mocked to simulate that worker2 entry was
  created in the past (T-1)

- simulate that another thread has picked up the worker2 entry by
  writing a newer time in the DB (other_thread_claimed_time)

- making sure that the do_cleanup method uses a time between these two
  (T)

This way we will no longer rely on the values returned by utcnow().

It doesn't really make since to give up connectimg to the OVN DBs
since we can't do anything without them. If ovsdb-server is slow
and takes more than timeout seconds, everything reconnecting after
partial downloads and starting over is not going to make things
better.

We can change the behavior in ovsdbapp, but doing it without
making non-backportable API changes isn't easily doable.
The plan would be, after merging this back through stable, to
modify ovsdbapp to allow setting different connection and txn
timeouts and being able to disable the timeout in wait_for_change
with a value of -1. Then in the main branch of neutron we can
use that going forward.

This change hides the AccountLocked exception from being returned
to the end user to hide sensitive information that a potential
malicious person could gain insight from.

The notification handler catches the AccountLocked exception as
before, but after sending the audit notification, it instead
bubbles up Unauthorized rather than AccountLocked.

The maintenance method check_for_mcast_flood_reports() was not checking
if that instance of the maintenance task has a valid lock before trying
to execute a transaction.

This patch adds such check so instances of the maintenance task without
a valid lock will just return.

The current code looks at a hash ring node's created_at/updated_at
fields and tries to determine whether the node has been updated
based on whether updated_at - created_at > 1 second (due to the
method that initially fills them being different by microseconds).
Unfortunately, due to the notify() method being called which calls
the hash ring node's touch_node(), a node can be updated in under
a second, meaning we will prevent caching for much longer than
we intend.

When using sqlite in-memory db, this continually re-creating the
Hash Ring objects for every event that is processed is exposing an
issue where rows that should be in the db just *aren't*.

This patch instead limits the hash ring nodes to api workers and
prevents caching only until the number of nodes == number of api
workers on the host. The switch from spawning hash ring nodes
where !is_maintenance to is_api_worker is primarily because it
seems to be difficult to get a list of *all* workers from which to
subtract the maintenance worker so that _wait_startup_before_caching
can wait for that specific number of workers. In practice, this
means that RpcWorker and ServiceWorker workers would not process
HashRing events.

A note on bug 1903008: While this change will greatly reduce the
likelihood of this issue taking place, we still have some work to
do in order to fully understand why it rubs the database backend
in the wrong way. Thus, we will make this change 'related to'
instead of closing the bug.

This will not work when an operator wants to upgrades from osp-16.1 to
osp-16.2:
16.2 is targeting rhel-8.4 with container-tools:3.0, providing a newer
podman version.

During the upgrade process, we end in a state where we're still running
rhel-8.2, with container-tools:3.0 enabled - leading to an issue when it
comes to the podman version we can get.

Removing this file (and backporting this change down to stable/train)
will allow a swift and smooth fix.

As a last word, this ""last security"" isn't that useful anymore, since we
have a task that ensures we have the correct module stream[1][2].

The maintenance method check_for_mcast_flood_reports() was not checking
if that instance of the maintenance task has a valid lock before trying
to execute a transaction.

This patch adds such check so instances of the maintenance task without
a valid lock will just return.

Added a convertion method in the ""port.mac_address"" parameter. This
convertion will return a sanitized MAC address formatted as:
  xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

This patch is not creating a new extension (that should be the
regular process):
- To avoid the Neutron extension explosion.
- Because this method will not validate the MAC address but
  sanitize it, if valid. Other services or projects will expect
  a MAC address with the defined format.
- This sanitization won't change the MAC address value.
- This sanitization will be always enabled (no extension needed).

Moving the network and port management for OVN
bridge MAC addresses to ansible.

Removes the heat resources, and adds an external
deploy task at step 0 in the ovn controller service
templates which uses the 'tripleo_ovn_mac_addresses'
ansible module to create/remove OVN mac address ports.

Adds parameter role_specific OVNStaticBridgeMacMappings,
parameter that can be used to set static bridge mac
mappings. When this is set no neutron resources will be
created by the tripleo_ovn_mac_addresses ansible module.
OVNStaticBridgeMacMappings must be used for standalone
deployments.

""host"" in Cinder, which is not the same thing.

In case of hairpin LB traffic (member of the LB calls the LB and the
request is directed back to the same member) OVN replaces the source-ip
of the request with the LB IP. This means that pods with network
policies applied may have that traffic blocked when it should be
allowed.

To fix that this commit makes sure that SGs used for NPs include ingress
rules for each of the Service in it's namespace. It's not ideal but
seems to be a fair compromise between opening as little traffic as
possible and increasing number of security groups and rules.

As this commit makes sure all the NPs in the namespaces are reanalyzed
every time a Service is created or deleted, a little fixes in order to
support that are also made.

Kayobe removes any systemd-networkd configuration generated by netplan,
since it can shadow our own configuration. This is performed via a
handler, but in practice it may run after the handler that restarts
systemd-networkd. This can leave the system using the netplan
configuration, which might not be correct. For example, if the interface

Recent multipathd doesn't remove path devices timely when it receives
burst of udev events but wait for a while to start actual removal.
Because os-brick removes path devices in a short time during detaching
a multipath device, it is likely to hit this burst limit and sometimes
path devices are not removed before a subsequent operation is started.

This change ensures that os-brick tells mutlipathd to remove path
devices when the devices should be deleted, so that orphan paths are
not left when starting a subsequent attach operation.

tacker-server has got two-stage process launcher since a long time ago.
While it doesn't matter if {api_workers} is set to one or unset, which
is the case by default on installation via devstack, it should have
resulted in an odd situation in other cases as follows:

1). surprisingly the number of workers was not {api_workers} but
    {api_workers}*{api_workers}. Notice that the launcher processes are
    also present so the resulting number of tacker-server processes was
    1+{api_workers}*({api_workers}+1).

    E.g., when {api_workers}=100, the number of tacker-server processes
    is 10101.

2). GreenPool is per the second stage launcher. That means {api_workers}
    number of workers, each of which is a green thread on a seperate
    process (spawned by ProcessLauncher), share the same pool. It means
    that the second stage launcher does not only fail to provide
    performance scaling, but also more likely to unnecessarily keep some
    workers starved due to a process which starts sleeping before
    yielding.

This patch fixes it so that there is just a one-stage launcher.

Call the volume's rpcapi remove_export method with
a ""call"" instead of a ""cast"" when detaching volumes
in the backup manager.

This prevents _detach_volume() from returning before
the remove_export() has completed, which helps prevent
problems where remove_export() races against a
subsequent operation.

tripleo-ansible is getting installed in TQ venv via TQE
requirements.txt file. We are removing that requirements.

During installation of tripleo-ansible in venv via pip
causes issues with other packages leading to various module
import failure.

It also blocks content provider job as it uses
podman_container.py module to deploy the content provider
registry.

In order to fix all these, we can use the same module
from tripleo-ansible rpm deployed using repo setup
and expose it ansible via ansible.cfg library path.

assertItemsEqual was removed from Python's unittest.TestCase in
Python 3.3 [1][2]. We have been able to use them since then, because
testtools required unittest2, which still included it. With testtools
removing Python 2.7 support [3][4], we will lose support for
assertItemsEqual, so we should switch to use assertCountEqual.

Thanks to Dirk Mueller for noticing this issue in other projects.

The behavior when a bootable iso is provided behind an http server is
to download and serve the image from the conductor; the image is
removed only when the node is undeployed.
In certain cases, for example on large deployments, this could cause
undesired behaviors, like the conductor nodes running out of disk storage.

`BarbicanPkcs11CryptoOsLockingOk`.

The patch also deprecates `BarbicanPkcs11CryptoTokenLabel` in favor of
the new option that can be set to more than one label.

This will not work when an operator wants to upgrades from osp-16.1 to

16.2 is targeting rhel-8.4 with container-tools:3.0, providing a newer
podman version.

During the upgrade process, we end in a state where we're still running
rhel-8.2, with container-tools:3.0 enabled - leading to an issue when it
comes to the podman version we can get.

Removing this file (and backporting this change down to stable/train)
will allow a swift and smooth fix.

As a last word, this ""last security"" isn't that useful anymore, since we
have a task that ensures we have the correct module stream[1][2].

The first DB operation done during a network update is a network DB
register retrieval. This information is stored in memory during
the DB transaction context and it's updated with any change done
to the DB register and the relationships; e.g., the network DB model
field ""qos_policy_binding"" is a backref relationship with a

instance was subsequently added and happened to have the same IP address
the charm would never add the new instance to the cluster because it
believed the instance was already configured and clustered based on

This commit reshapes the existing updates logic to allow running validations
groups in a more generic way. Including a task file in which the following
is executed:
- Execute the group being passed validation_group if it's included in
  the validation_allowed_groups.
- Log the output into a log file.
- Retrieve the validations results and fail if there is any validation
  failed.
- Log all the tasks executed in each failed validation.

At the same time, this patch invokes the pre-upgrade validation group for
FFU, both before starting with the upgrade (which uses mistral to trigger
the validation in OSP13 [0]) and before starting with the overcloud upgrade
(which uses the new validations framework).

Unless explicitly mocked, all dependencies of tested
modules are imported by default.

This can cause exceptions or even CI issues,
especially if the required module is listed present
in the test-requirements.txt file, but not in the spec file.

Furthermore, unnecessary imports in tests were also removed.

The problem is that the 'enable_internal_tls' is global and only checks

CephEnabledDashboard is set to false. Let's switch it to the internal
condition internal_tls_enabled which takes the dashboard into account.

This commit introduces two new test methods, test_vgpu_cold_migration
and test_vgpu_revert_cold_migration. The test method takes it's cold
migration logical from tempest test [1] with some changes to highlight
specific areas to check for vGPU enabled instances.

Each method follows the same general procedure. The instance's current
compute host and a target compute host are determined. The vGPU resource
usage is calculated for both hosts and verified they meet expectations.
The instance is then cold migrated to the target host. For the
test_vgpu_revert_cold_migration the instance is then reverted back to
its source host when the initial migration is complete. At the
conclusion of the migration the instance's XML is checked to confirm the
vGPU XML element is still present and the vGPU's vendor id is present in
the guest. Lastly the compute hosts resource providers are rechecked to
confirm the vGPU resource usage is accurate.

The test class VGPUTest has been refactored so that it no longer creates
the vGPU instance and flavor at the start of every test. Instead during
resource_setup the flavor and instance is created and that same instance
is used for the entire suite of test methods.

Call the volume's rpcapi remove_export method with
a ""call"" instead of a ""cast"" when detaching volumes
in the backup manager.

This prevents _detach_volume() from returning before
the remove_export() has completed, which helps prevent
problems where remove_export() races against a
subsequent operation.

Warnings are now turned into errors, failing
the doc build. This should prevent any more
syntax issues resulting in malformed, but still syntactically
valid, html output.

To aid with diagnosis of the failures:

The -E flag is now set to rebuild environment
from scratch for each run.

The `-a` flag is set to rebuild all html files,
regardless of their date.

The `--keep-going` flag is set so that the build
doesn't end after encountering first error, but
continues until the bitter end.

The CountPoolChildrenForQuota task takes 3 or 4 seconds to execute in
amphorav2. When cascade deleting a load balancer with many pools (60),
it might take minutes.

We don't need to get and to convert all the fields from the object to
compute the number of children of a pool, we can optimize this task by
creating a new method in the PoolRepository class.

When nova_virtlogd container gets restarted the instance console auth files
will not be reopened again by virtlogd. As a result either instances need
to be restarted or live migrated to a different compute node to get new
console logs messages logged again.
Usually on receipt of SIGUSR1, virtlogd will re-exec() its binary, while
maintaining all current logs and clients. This allows for live upgrades of
the virtlogd service on non containerized environments where updates just
by doing an RPM update.
To reduce the likelihood in a containerized environment virtlogd should
only be restarted on manual request, or on compute node reboot. It should
not be restarted on a minor update without migration off instances.
This introduces a nova_virtlogd_wrapper container and virtlogd wrapper
script, to only restart virtlogd on either manual or compute node restart.

With NovaEnableVirtlogdContainerWrapper the virtlogd wrapper can be
disabled.

When nova_virtlogd container gets restarted the instance console auth files
will not be reopened again by virtlogd. As a result either instances need
to be restarted or live migrated to a different compute node to get new
console logs messages logged again.
Usually on receipt of SIGUSR1, virtlogd will re-exec() its binary, while
maintaining all current logs and clients. This allows for live upgrades of
the virtlogd service on non containerized environments where updates just
by doing an RPM update.
To reduce the likelihood in a containerized environment virtlogd should
only be restarted on manual request, or on compute node reboot. It should
not be restarted on a minor update without migration off instances.
This introduces a nova_virtlogd_wrapper container and virtlogd wrapper
script, to only restart virtlogd on either manual or compute node restart.

Infra mirrors get their indices rebuilt to avoid broken
indices (due to partial update).
Unfortunately, this wipes out the cryptographic signatures.
Our approach so far was disabling apt security features globally.
However, this is not a valid choice for external repos.
It hid an issue we introduced with new RabbitMQ repos missing
proper keys installed in the image.
This caused permanent failures outside of our CI.

Our process should be as close as possible to users' experience.
This patch makes CI trust only the mirrors that have their indices
rebuilt (so infra mirrors).

Get ahead of the issue by replacing the dashes with underscores. Without
this, we see 'UserWarning' messages like the following on new enough
versions of setuptools:

  UserWarning: Usage of dash-separated 'description-file' will not be
  supported in future versions. Please use the underscore name
  'description_file' instead

It doesn't really make since to give up connectimg to the OVN DBs
since we can't do anything without them. If ovsdb-server is slow
and takes more than timeout seconds, everything reconnecting after
partial downloads and starting over is not going to make things
better.

We can change the behavior in ovsdbapp, but doing it without
making non-backportable API changes isn't easily doable.
The plan would be, after merging this back through stable, to
modify ovsdbapp to allow setting different connection and txn
timeouts and being able to disable the timeout in wait_for_change
with a value of -1. Then in the main branch of neutron we can
use that going forward.

Infra mirrors get their indices rebuilt to avoid broken
indices (due to partial update).
Unfortunately, this wipes out the cryptographic signatures.
Our approach so far was disabling apt security features globally.
However, this is not a valid choice for external repos.
It hid an issue we introduced with new RabbitMQ repos missing
proper keys installed in the image.
This caused permanent failures outside of our CI.

Our process should be as close as possible to users' experience.
This patch makes CI trust only the mirrors that have their indices
rebuilt (so infra mirrors).

During Queens release cycle it was decided that
clients_keystone/auth_uri should be defined and should point to
public URL to allow instances run some API calls.

Two changes were added:

- I4429d86d831f49f1bc0fef04379a81ada20b6ab6 was used to add
  related definitions to puppet-heat
- Ib1cb8a5da886e3f7afd88f8dc9d63f0847f677bd was used to add
  appropriate hiera defition to THT

But hiera definition in THT was incorrect:
heat::heat_keystone_clients_url was defined instead of
heat::heat_clients_keystone_uri.

heat_clients_keystone_uri parameter was removed from puppet-heat
during Train release cycle:
