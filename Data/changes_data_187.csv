When I call the S3 API using the AWS .NET SDK, I get the following error.

An error occurred (AuthorizationHeaderMalformed) when calling the
ListBuckets operation: The authorization header is malformed;
the region 'regionone' is wrong; expecting 'RegionOne'

The reason is that the AWS .NET SDK generates a signature by changing
the region name to lowercase. (AWS region names are all lowercase.)
The default region name of OpenStack is RegionOne, and custom region
names with capital letters can also be used.
If you set the location of the S3 API to a region name containing
uppercase letters, the AWS .NET SDK cannot be used.

There are two ways to solve this problem.

1. Force the location item of S3 API middleware setting to be set
   to lower case.
2. If the request contains credentail parameters that contain the
   lowercase region name, the region name of string_to_sign is
   modified to lowercase to generate a valid signature.

I think the second way is to make it more compatible.

This change adds idrac hardware type support of a BIOS interface
implementation that utilizes the Redfish out-of-band (OOB) management
protocol and is compatible with the integrated Dell Remote Access
Controller (iDRAC) baseboard management controller (BMC). It is named
'idrac-redfish'.

The idrac hardware type declares support for that new interface
implementation, in addition to all BIOS interface implementations it has
been supporting. The highest priority BIOS interface remains the same,
the one which relies on the Web Services Management (WS-Man) OOB
management protocol. The new 'idrac-redfish' immediately follows it.

As per victoria cycle testing runtime and community goal[1]
we need to migrate upstream CI/CD to Ubuntu Focal(20.04).

Most of the Tempest jobs will be migrate automatically once devstack
base job start running on Focal(Depends-On).

Few job like tempest-full-multinode and plugin sanity job needs to override
the nodeset. multinode job needs to run on Bionic till stable/ussuri and
on focal from master(victoria) onwards.

stable jobs testing stable branch needs to keep running on their supported
distro version which is bionic from stein till ussuri.

Keep 'tempest-integrated-compute' to run on bionic until
https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1894804 is fixed.

Facts gathering comes next after clearing the cached ones. Facts
will be gathered if --tags facts was specified. But cached facts get
cleared always, even w/o that tag.

In DCN deployments that may bring errors that can be avoided with
ansible-playbook-command.sh --tags facts. That is because fact caching
needs to be updated when running outside of the overcloud.

Fix this inconsistency so that the facts never cleared nor gathered
until the facts tag has been used explicitly.

This patch is a follow up from the main change[1] that adds support

Improvements added in this patch:
- Fail earlier when using this configuration with DHSS=True mode
  and for shares that support replication.
- Fail earlier if no cluster credentials where provided to configure
  volumes with QoS.
- Add support for migration and manage share operations.

In commit 7c1d964faa we fixed how we disable greendns. This patch adds
a test for this. It also lays down the groundwork for future tests
of how we manage eventlet's monkeypatching.

How and what eventlet monkeypatches can be controlled by environment
variables that are processed by eventlet at import-time (for exmaple,
EVENTLET_NO_GREENDNS). Nova manages all of this in nova.monkey_patch.
Therefore, nova.monkey_patch must be the first thing to import
eventlet. As nova.tests.functional.__init__ imports nova.monkey_patch,
our new test can go in the functional tree.

NOTE: in addition to the orginal backport, this patch also fix bandit
complains. Since 'access_token' literal is not an actual token, we can
safely mark it as false positive so bandit can stop chirping.

This change allows the container build tools to run without a
provided configuration file. The container configuration file
still in service was derived from our old kolla implementation
which no longer needs to exist. The build process will now
simply walk the build path and build all containers found when
a configuration file is not defined or present. Logging has
been added to inform the user of the tools discoveries which
should provide a nice user experience when running container
builds.

In the event a container configuration file is used, the tools
will now ensure all dependent images are inherently part of the
build preparation.

Tests have been updated to ensure that the client is operational
in both a config and config-less situation.

I7eb86edc130d186a66c04b229d46347ec5c0b625 introduced
VIR_ERR_DEVICE_MISSING into the hot unplug libvirt error code list
within detach_device_with_retry. While the change correctly referenced
that the error code was introduced in v4.1.0 it made no attempt to
handle versions prior to this. With MIN_LIBVIRT_VERSION currently pinned
to v4.0.0 we need to handle libvirt < v4.1.0 to avoid referencing the
non-existent error code within the libvirt module.

This patch squashes all database migrations up to and including
the Ocata release into a single migration.

By squashing the migrations into a single one, we are able
to fix the migration issues in MySQL 8.0+.

There has only been one database migration since Ocata, which
was not changed, and any existing database will be compatible
with this change.

This patch also unblocks testing in Ubuntu Focal, which uses
MySQL 8.0 as its default database.

When _poll_unconfirmed_resizes runs or a user tries to confirm
a resize in the API, if the source compute service is down the
migration status will be stuck in ""confirming"" status if it never
reached the source compute. Subsequent runs of
_poll_unconfirmed_resizes will not be able to auto-confirm the
resize nor will the user be able to manually confirm the resize.
An admin could reset the status on the server to ACTIVE or ERROR
but that means the source compute never gets cleaned up since you
can only confirm or revert a resize on a server with VERIFY_RESIZE
status.

This adds a check in the API before updating the migration record
such that if the source compute service is down the API returns a
409 response as an indication to try again later.

SingleCellSimple._fake_target_cell is updated so that tests using
it can assert when a context was targeted without having to stub
nova.context.target_cell. As a result some HostManager unit tests
needed to be updated.

This patch will enable user to configure single cinder store as well as

added in local.conf.

A. For single store
USE_CINDER_FOR_GLANCE=True

B. For Multiple stores
USE_CINDER_FOR_GLANCE=True
GLANCE_ENABLE_MULTIPLE_STORES=True

NOTE:
GLANCE_CINDER_DEFAULT_BACKEND should be one of the value from CINDER_ENABLED_BACKENDS.
If you need to configure nfs and ceph backend for cinder then you need to add respective plugins in
local.conf file.
If GLANCE_ENABLE_MULTIPLE_STORES is True then it will not configure
swift store for glance even if it is enabled in local.conf file.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect

will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/victoria branch, tests will

Originally it was added for missing python-cheetah dep
for openstack-nova. Nova has removed usage of it long
ago with [1]. rhel-7-server-rh-common-rpms should be
disabled once it's usage is over as it packages from
it can conflict with other openstack repos.

If some package which is needed by OpenStack Packages
is missing then instead of adding rhel-7-server-rh-common-rpms
repo consideration should be to add it in RDO.

When upgrading to Ussuri from Train we already had a virtualenv
called 'stackviz'. As a result the upgrade process attempts to
re-use the same virtualenv, which contains a pip executable for
Python 2. When trying to install Python 3 packages this fails.

We worked around this by using the same path versioning mechanism
used for tempest and other components, forcing the creation of a
new virtualenv. This patch applies this approach to the
virtualenvs for stackviz and tempestconf.

Add fenix plugin for host maintenance.
This feature creates plugin for fenix, create_vnf_maintenance() in VNFM and
VNFMaintenanceAlarmMonitor to create alarm for Fenix. And the feature modifies
alarm_receiver and CRUD in VNFM.

After this feature, all VNF has ALL_MAINTENANCE resource to interacts
with Fenix plugin and [VDU_NAME]_MAINTENANCE if VDU has maintenance property.
[VDU_NAME]_MAINTENANCE will use to perform VNF software modification.

Currently, the plugin can perform CRUD constraints for maintenance,
scale in/out and migration for MIGRATE and LIVE_MIGRATE. The feature has
functions for OWN_ACTION with modified healing, but it not works based on
default vnf workflow in Fenix. And The feature doesn't support server_group

So these features will be enhance after adding required.

This validation takes a list of dict describing the packages we want to
verify.
The main goal is to ensure we are avoiding issues at some point with
particularly sensitive packages, such as podman.

We can't use the ""package_facts"" ansible module, since we're allowing to
check available packages - i.e. versions that aren't installed on the
system.

With the current default, we ensure we get podman 1.6.4 on every nodes
(overcloud and undercloud).
This can be used during an upgrade in order to ensure we're not using
the wrong podman version - either as an inflight validation, or as a
manual step.

Also, it supports the full version number, with the release itself.

This means you can pass ""1.6.4-15"" for podman, in order to ensure you
get the precise version you want.

Please check the molecule tests in order to see how this validation can
be used.

Please note, the ""yum list"" part is slow since it will check on the
remote repositories for the available versions!

Last note, we're using ""yum"" here since the validation might be needed
on pre-dnf releases (namely, centos-7 or rhel-7).

* This patch refactors Mistral with the action provider concept
  that is responsible for delivering actions to the system. So
  it takes all the burden of managing action definitions w/o
  having to spread that across multiple subsystems like Engine
  and API and w/o having to assume that action definitions are
  always stored in DB.
* Added LegacyActionProvider  that represents the old way of
  delivering action definitions to the system. It pretty much just
  analyses what entries are configured in the entry point
  ""mistral.actions"" in setup.cfg and build a collection of
  corresponding Python action classes in memory accessible by names.
* The module mistral/services/actions.py is now renamed to
  adhoc_actions.py because it's effectively responsible only for
  ad-hoc actions (those defined in YAML).
* Added the new entry point in setup.cfg ""mistral.action.providers""
  to register action provider classes
* Added the module mistral/services/actions.py that will be a facade
  for action providers. Engine and other subsystems will need to
  work with it.
* Other small code changes.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect
rule on releases.openstack.org so that anyone working on this branch
will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/victoria branch, tests will
continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

When molecule runs, it installs ansible>2.8, which is version 2.10.0
since today. This now also installs the ansible-base package, currently
at version 2.10.1. Then it installs the version of ansible required by
kayobe, i.e. ansible>=2.8.0,<2.10.0 (currently 2.9.13).

We end up with a tox molecule venv containing:

ansible==2.9.13

Therefore, fix typo and invalid definition for the VNFD in the CSAR file.

Also, fix to the following settings that has a dependent on environment

With 1.8.x releases, haproxy consumes a lot of memory when
using 1,000,000 as default connection_limit.

This commit introduces a new configuration option for the Amphora
provider: [haproxy_amphora].default_connection_limit (defaulted to
50,000). This value is used when creating a listener with -1 (which is
the default) as connection_limit, or when unsetting connection_limit in
a listener.
Updating an existing listener by setting connection_limit to -1 also
sets it to default_connection_limit.

The global connection_limit for a load balancer is the sum of the
connection_limit of the listeners, but it cannot be over
HAPROXY_MAX_MAXCONN (which is still 1,000,000).

This change is to be able to provide keystone-credentials interface by
openstack-integrator charm. Openstack-integrator already has credentials
from keystone (sitting in the other model) from 'juju trust' or
charm config.

So it can expose them to kubernetes-master units directly in
keystone-credentials relation. This way we can reuse the existing
keystone from openstack model to authenticate users in k8s-dashboard etc.

Kayobe generates a host_vars file for each host in the Kolla Ansible
inventory. These contain network interfaces and other host-specific
things. Currently this is done by iterating over all hosts, which does
not scale well with a large number of hosts.

This change extracts the host vars generation into a separate role, and
executes it in a play targeted at all hosts, with delegate_to:
localhost. This ensures that host variable files are generated in
parallel.

The charm Octavia gate job has started to OOM for the Octavia
units as detailed on the bug.

This change addresses both that issue and attempts to increase the
velocity of the test by adding CPU cores which might help for the
time it takes to compile binary dependencies on initial deploy
and during the policyd tests.

Note that instead of explicitly mentioning amount of memory we
assume a flavor with more cores to also have more memory.

When molecule runs, it installs ansible>2.8, which is version 2.10.0
since today. This now also installs the ansible-base package, currently
at version 2.10.1. Then it installs the version of ansible required by
kayobe, i.e. ansible>=2.8.0,<2.10.0 (currently 2.9.13).

We end up with a tox molecule venv containing:

ansible==2.9.13
ansible-base==2.10.1

This causes the following issue:

ERROR! Unexpected Exception, this is probably a bug: cannot import name 'AnsibleCollectionLoader' from 'ansible.utils.collection_loader' (/home/zuul/src/opendev.org/openstack/kayobe/.tox/molecule/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible/utils/collection_loader/__init__.py)

This commit adds requirements.txt to the molecule tox deps, which
ensures the correct version of ansible gets installed first.

Trying to deploy OpenStack environment consisting of ironic nova
hypervisor & hardware Ironic node (not VM Ironic node) with devstack
got failed. When trying this, followings are set in devstack local.conf
file; ""VIRT_DRIVER=ironic"", ""IRONIC_BOOT_MODE=uefi' and
""IRONIC_IS_HARDWARE=true"".

Failure is due to three bugs in script in ""devstack"" & ""Ironic"":
 (1) function configure_nova_hypervisor in
     devstack/lib/nova_plugins/hypervisor-ironic,
 (2) function install_ironic in ironic/devstack/lib/ironic and
 (3) function configure_ironic_dirs in ironic/devstack/lib/ironic.

Because ""VIRT_DRIVER=ironic"" & ""IRONIC_IS_HARDWARE=true"" is set,
devstack doesn't install libvirt related packages. So, attempt to copy
files/directories to filesystem paths to be created when installing
libvirt related packages gets failed.
When ""IRONIC_BOOT_MODE=uefi"" is set, bug (2) & (3) occurs. Because
function install_ironic & configure_ironic_dirs tries to configure
libvirt related settings (e.g. modify /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf) and
there is no filesystem path related to libvirt, error occurs.

This commit fixes bug (2) by adding ""if"" clause to determine Ironic
node is hardware or not and to skip libvirt related operations when
Ironic node is hardware.

Switch to openstackdocstheme 2.2.1 and reno 3.1.0 versions. Using
these versions will allow especially:
* Linking from HTML to PDF document
* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Set openstackdocs_pdf_link to link to PDF file. Note that
the link to the published document only works on docs.openstack.org
where the PDF file is placed in the top-level html directory. The
site-preview places the PDF in a pdf directory.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

Remove docs requirements from lower-constraints, they are not needed
during install or test but only for docs building.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

The requirements repo is support python 3.5 as oldest python version
while swift still supports py27.

thus, requirements-check will fail on a couple of lines in swift.  The
check is only run when these files are touched.

The py2.7 packagers we know about aren't depending on upstream
requirements.txt for correctness and aside from all the production
deployments running on py2.7 we only realistically support >=py3.7

There's no good reason for our requirements.txt to be ""unspported"" by
the openstack requirements check job.  Since they only support >=py3.5
we can change our requirements.txt inline with that.  This should be
fine for everything we could hope to get out of both our
requirements.txt and the check!

Currently, vnf_package_vnfd table has a following constraint
in database created by tacker db migration.
This is incorrect, so this patch remove the constraint.

CONSTRAINT `CONSTRAINT_1` CHECK (`deleted` in (0,1))

This is created because `deleted` was boolean before.
`deleted` is varchar(36) now, so db migration change its type
by alter_column method. But this does not remove check constraint.
This patch add drop_constraint to remove the constraint.

The share ""manage"" API checks whether
an existing/known share is being imported by
matching the export path provided to existing
shares. This lookup does not consider the
fact that shares may have multiple export
locations, because it relies on an old/deprecated
""export_location"" property on shares which
was added to provide backwards compatibility
to the API that presented only one export
location per share.

Fix the lookup by using the ""export_location_path""
based lookup which is faster, since it performs
a meaningful join on the export locations table.

Ia18e9be4d07b732afd9db0007c541253f3cdaf82 bumped these versions in
Ussuri and while it's late in the Victoria cycle we now need to do the
same. Based on the LibvirtDistroSupportMatrix wiki page [1] the
following versions have been selected for the next min versions during
the Wallaby release:

NEXT_MIN_LIBVIRT_VERSION = (6, 0, 0)
NEXT_MIN_QEMU_VERSION = (4, 2, 0)

MIN_QEMU_VTPM is removed as part of this patch as it also requires
changes to functional tests that would otherwise fail.

Follow up patches will remove the following constants after this change:

- MIN_LIBVIRT_FILE_BACKED_DISCARD_VERSION
- MIN_{LIBVIRT,QEMU}_NATIVE_TLS_VERSION
- MIN_LIBVIRT_BETTER_SIGKILL_HANDLING
- MIN_LIBVIRT_VIDEO_MODEL_VERSIONS
- MIN_{LIBVIRT,QEMU}_PMEM_SUPPORT

This change depends on the following devstack change that introduces the
use of the Train UCA on Bionic nodes, allowing us to bump versions here
ahead of a move to Focal.

This patch is a follow up patch of the main change[1] that adds
support for share server migration in NetApp driver.
It fixes two issues:
- Data motion 'get_backend_configuration' now avoids sending vserver
  configuration, available only in DHSS=False mode, when driver is
  configured with DHSS=True.
- After migrating a share server, all volumes appears with different
  autosize configuration and need to be manually updated to the
  original values. Provisioning options are also being updated in the
  same method.

This change introduces an extend attached encrypted volume test
specifically using the LUKSv1 encryption format after issues were
discovered in bug #1861071. The test mostly reuses the existing test for
extending attached unencrypted volumes with some specific encryption
related logic being introduced in BaseVolumeAdminTest.

Note that while attached volume extension is not an admin only operation
the creation of the encrypted volume type is, resulting in this test
being labelled as an admin test.

A ``[compute-feature-enabled]/extend_attached_encrypted_volume``
configurable is also introduced to control when this test is ran.

Facts gathering comes next after clearing the cached ones. Facts
will be gathered if --tags facts was specified. But cached facts get
cleared always, even w/o that tag.

In DCN deployments that may bring errors that can be avoided with
ansible-playbook-command.sh --tags facts. That is because fact caching
needs to be updated when running outside of the overcloud.

Fix this inconsistency so that the facts never cleared nor gathered
until the facts tag has been used explicitly.

The ceph backup driver uses ceph's internal snapshot mechanism for doing
incremental backups. This type of incremental backup is more an
implementation detail than something that should be exposed to the
outside, because it makes handling of the backups harder.

By forcing backups to incremental, if an earlier backup exists, you can
only clean up old backups by deleting all backups, effectively giving up
the safety of backups, and restarting all over again.

The exported and imported diff results in a fully usable rbd image,
which effectively resembles base backup semantics, in the target cluster
and ceph has no problem deleting snapshots that are in the middle of the
snapshots history. By forcing all ceph backups to be full backups in
cinder, we can leverage this to enable easier backup management.

This change effectively flips the logic from change

This is a cleaned-up version of a patch we are currently using on a
standalone Cinder installation (non-OpenStack). This means that the basic
functionality of being able to create cinder volumes with peer persistence
has been validated. However, a multitude of tests will be required in order
to merge this functionality upstream.

A first attempt at listing the tests to be executed:

- Validation of the ""replication:peer_persistence"" setting
- Double-check implementation/configuration of peerpersistent volumes
- Validate creation of peerpersistent volumes when one 3PAR instance is
  unavailable
- Validate automatic fail-over of an existing peerpersistent volume when
  a 3PAR instance goes offline
- Validate manual fail-over of a peerpersistent volumes
- Evaluate retype functionality for peerpersistent volumes

Changed:

- Fixed invalid variable name
- Resolved all Flake8 warnings
- Fixed one invalid if-clause when replication is not enabled

Currently, IntelCnaHardwareManager inherits GenericHardwareManager
which makes it a new ""GenericHardwareManager"" with ""MAINLINE"" priority.
This causes all other hardware-managers with lower priority than
""MAINLINE"" never be used. To fix this, make IntelCnaHardwareManager
inherit basic HardwareManager.
