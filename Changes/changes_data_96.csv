That appears to be what is going on here.\n\nEvery job build records its inheritance path. For this particular build it is at: https://zuul.opendev.org/t/openstack/build/bc088154e50440fe9a2cacf52426748a/log/zuul-info/inventory.yaml#222-244 Notice that devstack-plugin-ceph-tempest-py3 has an explicit branch matcher on Xena. Looking at the code we can confirm: https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack-plugin-ceph/src/branch/stable/xena/.zuul.yaml#L100-L104 and https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack-plugin-ceph/src/branch/stable/xena/.zuul.yaml#L118\n\nI would strongly suggest that these branch matchers be deleted as they do not do what you want here. They override the behavior you expected. Typically branch matchers like that should be used only on projects that don't have branches that can be matched up to corresponding branches in other repos. Repos like openstack/openstack-zuul-jobs and openstack/project-config are in this camp. They are single branch repos that need to affect config in other projects various branches. But when you do them on branched repos like this one it only causes problems.""}, {'account_id': 4146, 'date': '2021-09-28 17:22:12.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 Review-Priority+2'}, {'account_id': 5314, 'date': '2021-09-28 18:52:05.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1\n\nFrom the discussion on [1] in the commit message, this looks like the correct fix.

(you could also use PYTHONTRACEMALLOC and PYTHONWARNINGS env vars)

Following this thread, it appears 'reno.scanner.Scanner' creates an
instance of 'dulwich.repo.Repo', however, it fails to close it [1]. The
'reno.loader.Loader' uses 'Scanner', meaning this also leaves around
open files.

The solution is simple: add a 'close()' method to both the 'Scanner' and
'Loader', and provide the necessary '__enter__' and '__exit__' magic
methods to use it as a context manager, like the 'Repo' object itself
supports.

Currently it isn't possible to set extra labels on pods that use
the labels snippet. This means users are required to fork the helm
repository for OpenStack services to add custom labels. Use cases
for this are for example injecting Istio sidecars.

This change introduces the ability to set one set of labels on all

We've seen this happen a couple of times in production where a root
container suddenly thinks it's unsharded as it's own_shard_range is
reset. The only way this can happen is if a new replica or handoff node
places a container and a new own_shard_range is created and replicated
to older sharded primaries.

In the sharding life cycle, only never sharded containers can have an
epoch of None. Once a container moves into the sharding state, or even
it collapses back into a single container a epoch will exist.

This means we only ever need to merge:
  - epoch == None -> epoch == None
  - epoch == ts[n] -> epoch == None
  - epoch == ts[n] -> epoch == ts[n]

As such this patch adds an extra epoch test to merge_shard_ranges that
if there if there is a shard_range with an epoch and the other without,
the one with an epoch wins.

The Trustway Proteccio HSM can somtimes return a network error when
attempting to finalize the cryptoki library.

The error can prevent reinitialization because we attempt to finalize
the library before initalizing a new connection.  When a network error
occurrs, barbican gets stuck in an error loop trying to finalize the
dead connection before starting a new one.

This patch adds code to ignore the network error when finalizing to
ensure we are able to attempt to reinitialize.

Connection errors during other operations will still result in 500
errors as expected.

This commit adds a tool that parses a directory of service.yaml policy
files and then converts them to the appropriate THT structure, using the
necessary service variables and templating.

The enable-secure-rbac.yaml is simply the current defaults generated
from code. First, generate all the policy files for each OpenStack
service:

  $ oslopolicy-sample-generator --namespace $SERVICE --output-file $DEST/$SERVICE.yaml

Next, uncomment all the default policies as a starting point for making
policy changes:

  $ sed -i 's/^#""/""/g' $DEST/$SERVICE.yaml

Next you can make changes to the policy files to reflect the changes you
want in your deployment.

Finally, you can generate the necessary heat template:

  $ ./convert_policy_yaml_to_heat_template.py -d $DEST

The tool outputs to stdout. It's up to the user to redirect to a file if
they wish to save results.

Openstack users are configured with openstacklib, which in turns
drive puppet-mysql to create several DB user for each db service:
<service>@'%' <service>@<ip> and <service>@<mysql_vip>.

We create several users because we use two different parameters
host and allowed_hosts in openstacklib, which only has the effect
of creating a list of users per openstack service.

However since we always create a user '%', this wildcard host
will always allow connection to the DB, so the other users are
currently not useful as they don't get any additional grants or
restrictions.

Simplify the entire mysql user creation to only generate one
user per service, with a wildcard host.

in favour of treating all notification types equally.

This patch fixes an issue with the DB schema migration associated
with this change, which will fail if any notifications using
built-in notification types are configured at the time of the upgrade.

Openstacklib was used in a way that generated additional

this user creation on an existing environment, we must
delete the unused users manually, as puppet-mysql never

Do not fail if haproxy container UUID changes.

Reasoning behind: at the time the chgrp&HUP block is executed, the new
cert has already been deployed on the host, with the correct owner
already set. So if the container_id changes at this time, it will pick
up the new cert automatically. That means that by ignoring errors
caused by mismatching UUID we'd skip an unnecessary consequent restart
of the newly spawned container, ending up with the same result. So the
safest path here would provide a sort of a cascading failure for the
crasher->restarted->reloaded once again containers.

Looks like swift log forwarding is skipped atm. Conditions on
ansible blocks are evaluated per task and once a var is
registered, 'is not defined' check (from block) fails and the tasks
are skipped.

This keeps the tasks same in both services so the duplicates
are excluded in DeployStepsTasks.

Manila's wallaby release [1] made it possible for the v2 endpoint to
not include a tenant_id (project_id). This change was made to
accommodate interactions by system scoped users.

the ""tenant_id"" templating, because system scoped tokens cannot be

safest path here would provide a sort of a cascading failure for the
crasher->restarted->reloaded once again containers.

The recent release of Ceph Pacific saw a change to the clone() logic
where invalid values of stripe unit would cause an error to be returned
where previous versions would correct the value at runtime.  This
becomes a problem when creating a volume from an image, where the source
RBD image may have a larger stripe unit than cinder's RBD driver is
configured for.  When this happens, clone() is called with a stripe unit
that is too small given that of the source image and the clone fails.

The RBD driver in Cinder has a configuration parameter
'rbd_store_chunk_size' that stores the preferred object size for cloned
images.  If clone() is called without a stripe_unit passed in, the
stripe unit defaults to the object size, which is 4MB by default.  The
issue arises when creating a volume from a Glance image, where Glance is
creating images with a default stripe unit of 8MB (distinctly larger
than that of Cinder).  If we do not consider the incoming stripe unit
and select the larger of the two, Ceph cannot clone an RBD image with a
smaller stripe unit and raises an error.

This patch adds a function in our driver's clone logic to select the
larger of the two stripe unit values so that the appropriate stripe unit
is chosen.

It should also be noted that we're determining the correct stripe unit,
but using the 'order' argument to clone().  Ceph will set the stripe
unit equal to the object size (order) by default and we rely on this
behaviour for the following reason: passing stripe-unit alone or with
an order argument causes an invalid argument exception to be raised in
pre-pacific releases of Ceph, as it's argument parsing appears to have
limitations.

There is cases when a command times out or when it fails
that we and Puppet [1] will output the raw command that
was executed.

For a user create command that output contains the
--password argument passed down to openstack CLI which
causes sensitive passwords to be leaked into log files
of the system executing Puppet, these can then be shipped
of from the system into a remote syslog and still be in
plain text.

This tries to use Ruby gsub with a regular expression
matching the two cases and instead output [redacted secret]
the same way we do with config provider.

Router_info's _process_internal_ports() method is the one which is
manipulating router_info.internal_ports cache and network_update()
method from the L3 agent is relying on that Router_info's cache to
check if updated network is connected to the router or not.
So they shouldn't be run together as that may cause some race conditions
and unexpected issues, like e.g. described in the related bug.

Until now, network_update event was the only one which was processed
without using queue of events. And because of that such race condition
as described above were possible.
To fix that, this patch changes network_update method in the way that it
now adds update events for each router hosted by agent to the queue.
Those events for single routers are then processed, checks if network is
actually connected to the router and if yes, schedules router update to
be processed.

Router_info's _process_internal_ports() method is the one which is
manipulating router_info.internal_ports cache and network_update()
method from the L3 agent is relying on that Router_info's cache to
check if updated network is connected to the router or not.
So they shouldn't be run together as that may cause some race conditions
and unexpected issues, like e.g. described in the related bug.

Until now, network_update event was the only one which was processed
without using queue of events. And because of that such race condition
as described above were possible.
To fix that, this patch changes network_update method in the way that it
now adds update events for each router hosted by agent to the queue.
Those events for single routers are then processed, checks if network is
actually connected to the router and if yes, schedules router update to
be processed.

Router_info's _process_internal_ports() method is the one which is
manipulating router_info.internal_ports cache and network_update()
method from the L3 agent is relying on that Router_info's cache to
check if updated network is connected to the router or not.
So they shouldn't be run together as that may cause some race conditions
and unexpected issues, like e.g. described in the related bug.

Until now, network_update event was the only one which was processed
without using queue of events. And because of that such race condition
as described above were possible.
To fix that, this patch changes network_update method in the way that it
now adds update events for each router hosted by agent to the queue.
Those events for single routers are then processed, checks if network is
actually connected to the router and if yes, schedules router update to
be processed.

519ca1c083 added support for installing kolla-ansible with `--user`.

This patch adds support for both `--user` and `--editable` which
installs in `~/.local`.

Note that `--user` is also now enabled by default in pip when running a
`pip install` command without activated virtualenv and without
permission to write the system python environment ie. /usr/lib/python3.9

With this patch, you can just `pip install --editable
/path/to/your/kolla-ansible` as non root and without virtualenv, it will
install `~/.local/bin/kolla-ansible` and add an egg-link pointing to the
repository path.

Since this patch did not modify the old code structure, \nI did not consider adding testcases. From the perspective of unit test coverage, I think there are indeed \na lot of unit tests that need to be added, but I think this is not what this patch should do.\n\n2.

When creating a duplicated subscription, according to spec SOL003,
the api should return 303 See Other instead of 201 Created.

To fix this error, the following things is done in this patch:
1.Fix the error when the database virtual field extracts
the value from json in table `vnf_lcm_filters`.
2.Fix the error of sql query statement when querying subscription.
3.The attribute VnfProductsFromProviders should be an array, not an
object. Fix this error in UT, FT and schemas.
4.Fix typos when writing ""object"" as ""objects"" in dict ""_versions""
in vnf_lcm schemas.
5.Rewrite the throwing and catching of SeeOther exception of this
api to fix the following errors: SeeOther should be thrown instead
of Exception; the return body should be empty instead of
ProblemDetail; the return header should contain location instead
of link.

In the fix for bug 1839560 [1][2], soft-deleted compute nodes may be
restored, to ensure we can reuse ironic node UUIDs as compute node
UUIDs. While this seems to largely work, it results in some nasty errors
being generated [3]:

    InvalidRequestError This session is in 'inactive' state, due to the
    SQL transaction being rolled back; no further SQL can be emitted
    within this transaction.

This happens because compute_node_create is decorated with
pick_context_manager_writer, which begins a transaction. While
_compute_node_get_and_update_deleted claims that calling a second
pick_context_manager_writer decorated function will begin a new
subtransaction, this does not appear to be the case.

This change removes pick_context_manager_writer from the
compute_node_create function, and adds a new _compute_node_create
function which ensures the transaction is finished if
_compute_node_get_and_update_deleted is called.

The new unit test added here fails without this change.

This change marks the removal of the final FIXME from the functional
test added in [4].

Our current `attachment_delete` methods in the volume API and the
manager are using DB methods directly, which makes the OVOs present in
those methods get out of sync with the latest data, which leads to
notifications having the wrong data when we send them on volume detach.

This patch replaces DB method calls with OVO calls and moves the
notification call to the end of the method, where we have the final
status on the volume.

It also adds the missing detach.start notification when deleting an
attachment in the reserved state.

When using ephemeral Heat, the update run can no

With this change, we also change the converge to just

base_path will get overwritten eg. when kayobe seed host configure
is executed. This commit aims to prevent this by having separated

When scaling occurs during the heat cooldown, VNF is not actually
scaled but the scale_level value in the VNF information will change.
This bug happens because Heat does not return any error responses when
it cannot perform scaling action due to the cooldown, and thus Tacker
cannot detect a scaling failure.

To fix this bug, this patch changes the ``scale`` method of OpenStack
infra-driver to wait for scaling until cooldown ends.

When the L3 agent starts, reads the floating IP rule priority from
a state file created by ""FipRulePriorityAllocator"". In case of not
having all floating IPs registers in this file, the method:
- Creates a new priority for this floating IP.
- Creates the ""ip rule"" in the namespace.
- Adds a new entry in ""self.floating_ips_dict"".

All ""ip rules"" present in the namespace that do not match the
registered fixed IP address (""from"") and the priority assigned
are deleted.

Ie36401c782f023d1d5f2623732619105dc2cfa24 was intended
to address OSSA-2021-002 (CVE-2021-3654) however after its
release it was discovered that the fix only worked
for urls with 2 leading slashes or more then 4.

This change adresses the missing edgecase for 3 leading slashes
and also maintian support for rejecting 2+.

This patch sets the failing lower-constraints job to non-voting until
final fix arrives for the failure.

With the latest setuptools (bundled into python virtualenv) the lower
constraints job started to fail on ussuri when it tries to install old
version of 'decorator'. The error message is:

  error in decorator setup command: use_2to3 is invalid.

The needed minimal version of 'decorator' would be 4.0.0, but it is
only needed if the latest version of setuptools (virtualenv) is used.
On old branches it would be good to pin setuptools (virtualenv),
otherwise we can face similar issues. Until the final decision / fix,
let's just set the lower-constraints job non-voting to unblock the
gate.

Port the legacy legacy-tempest-dsvm-multibackend-matrix job to the
native Zuul v3 syntax, and rename it following the guidelines
(cinder-multibackend-matrix-migration).

This job tests the migration between two different backends
specified through the volume.backend_names configuration
key in tempest.conf.

Now the job leverages the existing zuul code, namely the
run-tempest role, which is called multiple times with all
the possible combinations of the 3 tested backends
(lvm, ceph, nfs) where the source and the destination differ.

The final JUnitXML output summarizes the test results
for each of the tested combinations.

Neutron's firewall initialization with OVS seems
to be the source of our pain with ports not being found
by ironic jobs. This is because firewall startup errors
crashes out the agent with a RuntimeError while it is deep
in it's initial __init__ sequence.

This ultimately seems to be rooted with communication
with OVS itself, but perhaps the easiest solution is
to just disable the firewall....

own implemented Clients, as for example some of QoS APIs.\nIn fact, we (VANS DFG) just wanted to use ""Limit BW QoS APIs"" for Octavia purposes, but then we\'ve found that some of QoS APIs are simply missing in Tempest code and separately implemented in Neutron. \nI really don\'t know why it was done this way, but probably it was reasonable I guess.\n\nAnyway, we\'ve decided not doing the same ""work around"" for Octavia Tempest Plugin and that is why, I\'ve jumped in and added missing APIs code into the Tempest:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/tempest/commit/ca3e51356502b6bca86fa5b2c81f2805aecb06f0\n\nSo now we are good to go and use QoS APIs in Octavia Tempest Plugin, in addition it\'s now makes sense refactoring Neutron Code. \nIf the code that we need is already implemented in Tempest, why having duplicated pieces doing the same stuff in Plugin, correct?\n\nThis is the reason for refactoring Neutron, at least for QoS APIs.\n\nThanks!'}, {'account_id': 28609, 'date': '2021-09-09 17:13:59.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 9:\n\nrecheck'}, {'account_id': 28609, 'date': '2021-09-09

The newly introduced role oslo_config_validator is probably a
better framework to validate settings as it's centralized and
will most probably be called by sosreport for troubleshooting
purpose. It only makes sense to move some setting validations
to this new role when possible.

This patch also adds the nova_event_callback role documentation in

When cinder switched its DB backend to alembic, the aforementioned
command was modified to support querying the DB revision via alembic.
However, there are two mistakes in the current implementation. Firstly,
the code called 'alembic_api.current' [1] with an 'Engine' object, but
that API expects a Config object instead. Secondly, the same code
expected that this call returns the revision, but that call just prints
the revision to the standard output instead.

Correct both issues by switching the API used from calling the alembic
command API, which is mostly created for CLI consumption, to a
'MigrationContext.get_current_revision' API that is intended to be used
as a Python API.

This fix mirrors a similar change made to nova as part of change
I9fa7c03310c5bdb82e9a9c39727edb12eeae77f0, which fixed bug #1943436 in
nova.

attachment on remove_export failure

When deleting an attachment, if the driver's remove_export or the
detach_volume method call fails in the cinder driver, then the
attachment status is changed to error_detaching but the REST API call
doesn't fail.

The end result is:
- Volume status is ""available""
- Volume attach_status is ""detached""
- There is a volume_attachment record for the volume
- The volume may still be exported in the backend

The volume still being exported in the storage array is not a problem,
since the next attach-detach cycle will give it another opportunity for
it to succeed, and we also do the export on volume deletion.

So in the end leaving the attachment in error_detaching status doesn't
have any use and creates confusion.

This patch removes the attachment record when on an attachment delete
request if the error happens on remove_export or detach_volume calls.

This doesn't change how the REST API attachment delete operation
behaves, the change is that there will not be a leftover attachment
record with the volume in available and detached status.

This patch is adding --check and --diff options
to kolla-ansible, which cause that kolla-ansible
run will be more verbose and able to run in
semi dry-run mode.

The --diff option for kolla-ansible can be used alone or
with --check. When you run in diff mode, any module that
supports diff mode reports the changes made or, if used
with --check, the changes that would have been made.
Diff mode is most common in modules that manipulate files
(for example, the template module) but other modules might
also show ‘before and after’ information
(for example, the user module).

There is a possibility that haproxy container crashed and restarted
with another UUID, while the deployment is trying to reload it
after reconfiguring the certificates, by sending a
`kill -HUP <uuid-of-the-container>`. In that case, ingore errors
for the commands block, since there is no longer need to reload the
newly created container.

Also fix the failure condition for HAproxy chgrp script.

Reasoning behind: at the time the chgrp&HUP block is executed, the new
cert has already been deployed on the host, with the correct owner
already set. So if the container_id changes at this time, it will pick
up the new cert automatically. That means that by ignoring errors
caused by mismatching UUID we'd skip an unnecessary consequent restart
of the newly spawned container, ending up with the same result. So the
safest path here would provide a sort of a cascading failure for the
crasher->restarted->reloaded once again containers.

Router_info's _process_internal_ports() method is the one which is
manipulating router_info.internal_ports cache and network_update()
method from the L3 agent is relying on that Router_info's cache to
check if updated network is connected to the router or not.
So they shouldn't be run together as that may cause some race conditions
and unexpected issues, like e.g. described in the related bug.

Until now, network_update event was the only one which was processed
without using queue of events. And because of that such race condition
as described above were possible.
To fix that, this patch changes network_update method in the way that it
now adds update events for each router hosted by agent to the queue.
Those events for single routers are then processed, checks if network is
actually connected to the router and if yes, schedules router update to
be processed.

If there is a change to the root container's storage_policy_index (e.g.
after it's deleted and recreated), the reconciler will kick in and
migrate objects (or tombstone rows) to the new/correct storage policy.

To ensure this works correctly on sharded containers, we must propagate
a policy_index change on the root to it's shards.

Shards are ""extensions"" for a root. They're a fragment of a root
container's metadata that will keep in sync with other replicas of that
same fragment. They tend to come and go (as things shrink or cleave again)
during the life of a root container.

We already have landed a patch that in essence makes the shards storage
for whatever objects the root puts in at whatever policy the root supplies.
So the question becomes how would be enqueue the wrong objects to the
reconciler?

This makes a shard's SPI flexible, it'll update it's SPI with that of the
root it's talking too, using the same decision code that the reconciler uses
to decide if a nornal or root container needs to change SPI.

Because we are using the reconciler's decision making code and already
use X-Newest when finding the right root replica to talk too, this
should limited any flapping that may occur if SPIs of differnt replicas
are out of sync.
This also means the way we enqueue objects to the reconciler queue doesn't
change and will happen during the shard/fragment replication (as now).

Further in previous discussions, we've shown how out of character a SPI
is and If we end up enqueue-ing a bunch of objects (incorrectly) and then
flap back then the reconciler will just noop them in the queue right?

When using the OF API (currently Neutron only uses native

OF controller (set the OF procols, set the bridge fail mode). During
the controller restart, a command can return a ""InvalidDatapath""

Until the requirements repository has as stable/xena branch, tests will

In functional tests of the HA and DVR HA routers, when e.g.
failover is tested, we should always wait for routers to be in the
expected initial state (primary or backup) before router failover
will actually be done.
Without that, we may hit race condition when initial router's state
is enqueued but not processed yet and then state will be changed thus
no any action will be performed by L3 agent and test may fail.

Using stateless NAT in OVN should always be a better choice for FIPs
because it allows to avoid hitting conntrack, potentially improving
NAT performance, esp. where hardware offload for the openflow rules is
involved.

The only limitation for using stateless NAT in OVN is that it requires
1:1 IP mapping; which is always the case for FIPs. This is why this
patch unconditionally switches to stateless for all FIPs.

Before setting stateless key to NAT's options, check that 'options'
are supported. (Support was added in OVN 20.03 as part of stateless
NAT implementation.) If an older OVN version is used, nothing changes.

The patch also adds a runtime migration rule for neutron-server to
transform all existing stateful fips to stateless.

In functional tests of the HA and DVR HA routers, when e.g.
failover is tested, we should always wait for routers to be in the
expected initial state (primary or backup) before router failover
will actually be done.
Without that, we may hit race condition when initial router's state
is enqueued but not processed yet and then state will be changed thus
no any action will be performed by L3 agent and test may fail.
