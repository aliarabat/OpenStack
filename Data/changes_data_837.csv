* Add field that allows user to upload CA certificate
  that emitted vCenters TLS/SSL certificate (Self-Signed certificate).
  It allow cinder-volume configured with VMwareVcVmdkDriver
  and nova-compute configured with VMwareVCDriver verify
  connection to vCenter server.

* Add checkbox ""Bypass vCenter certificate verification"" for
  cinder-volume, nova-compute, Glance vSphere backend.

These changes will allow the cover use cases for cinder-volume,
nova-compute and Glance vSphere backend:

1. Bypass vCenter certificate verification (default). Certificate
verification turn off. This case is useful for faster deployment
and for testing environment.

2. vCenter is using a Self-Signed certificate. In this case the
user must upload custom CA bundle file certificate.

3. vCenter server certificate was emitted by know CA (e.g. GeoTrust).
In this case user have to leave CA certificate bundle upload field empty.

The transient statuses are not persited in DB because the status of node
should represent the current state of node, for example: node is
provisioned or node is deployed.  The synthetic states: like error,
deploying, etc. are used only for providing additional for user about
status of node at this moment.  This statuses can be calculated on
demand.  Also node.error_type has type 'String' instead of 'Enum' Also
added handling status  'deleted' in response, which means that node
should be deleted from cluster.

We had grown several similar methods of mocking the imagebackend
module. This patch creates a fixture which covers all existing uses.

As well covering existing uses, it also exposes a new test interface,
the disks dict, which makes it easy for tests to assert calls to
imagebackend for specific disks. This has already uncovered several
bugs in both code and tests which were previously untested.

The ability to assert calls at the imagebackend interface is also
critical to the effort to refactor the internal interfaces of
libvirt.driver. By mocking at the imagebackend interface we can assert
that we continue to manipulate disks as before as we change those
interfaces. For example, it is an explicit goal that change Ie5d47f55
makes almost no test changes, despite making significant code changes
in libvirt.driver.

We can revisit this decision incrementally after establishing new
interfaces, which should also allow us to reduce test duplication. For
example, change Ic7b3058f starts to remove individual tests for image
fetching fallback because these now have a common implementation with
their own tests.

We make some associated fixes in tests:

test_spawn_without_image_meta:
    Change If03b166d accidentally introduced a duplicated test. We
    remove it

test_spawn_with_config_drive:
    This was rewritten in change I931421ea. However, the written test
    neither created nor tested for a config disk. We move it to be
    with the other spawn tests and rewrite it again.

test_spawn_with_pci_devices:
    This test was touching the DB by accessing drvr._conn. We
    additionally mock this to fix the DB access.

This case is useful for faster deployment and

2. vCenter is using a Self-Signed certificate.

A new mechanism driver is included in this patchset. This has a
corresponding SR-IOV agent implementation as well.

The mechanism driver supports vnic_type direct. Both flat and vlan
network types are suported. The mappings reference maintained by this
driver is derived from agent configuration.  Agent periodically updates
mechanism driver with a list of physical networks derived from port
labels of physical ports of SR-IOV adapters. Mechanism driver validates
incoming port for binding if it has valid physical network attached to
it.  To do this, the check_segment_for_agent method is used by
try_to_bind_segement_for_agent. Under the covers, mappings from the
agent are matched with physical network attribute of the segment.

This mechanism driver also provides vlan information during binding to
vif plug mechanism on nova side. To do this, this mechanism driver
provides binding:vif_details with vlan id. On nova side, during vif plug
operation, vlan can be retrieved from ['details']['vlan'] attribute of
vif.

This patchset also includes changes to setup.cfg. A console script
driver to setup networking-powervm-sriov-agent along with its sea
counterpart.

setup.cfg changes also include Mechanism driver setup in ml2.conf
and entry_points.txt file in runtime environment.

This patch add transformers functionality, that helps handle with
versioning of data transformations and keep transformations code in one
place. You define transformation classes for particular data one class
per version of fuel, then define transformation methods. With a little
help of library functions, you get a Transformer object that processes
your data from version `a` throughout all versions to `b`.

Example:
```
transformer = ClusterTransformer(from_version='7.0', to_version='9.0')
new_attrs = transformer.transform_attributes(cluster.editable)
```

In this example, you have cluster 7.0 and want to migrate attributes to
cluster version 9.0. If you have defined `transform_attributes` for some
versions from 7.0 to 9.0 they all will be called one by one and result
of one transformer will be passed as an argument to another.

So far Nailgun has a bunch of managers for various tasks (transactions).
The way towards everything-is-a-graph means we won't have hardcoded
transactions and hence requires a new single manager to handle them all.

Transaction manager runs specified graphs on specified nodes within
single transaction (task), so anyone can poll it to check the progress.

By introducing transaction manager and moving everything to graphs, we
can't rely anymore on task names as a unique thing for transaction

columns - graph_type and dry_run - to make distinguish by executed
graphs.

2. vCenter is using a Self-Signed certificate. In this case the

This will stop wasting network bandwidth for monitoring.

E.g. a 200-node OpenStack installation produces aronud 10k queues and
10k channels. Doing single list_queues/list_channels in cluster in this
environment results in 27k TCP packets and around 12 megabytes of
network traffic. Given that this calls happen ~10 times a minute with 3
controllers, it results in pretty significant overhead.

We gave this job a go: it was not executed on a continuous basis
for a while; after watching how it perfomed on [1] for at least
a few months we noticed that a) it is rather flaky, b) no-one cares
to bring it back to sanity, and c) our queue may be rather busy.

We should consider having nodes be put to better use and therefore
this patch demotes the job to the experimental queue for occasional
troubleshooting, if deemed necessary.

As part of I0e4e2623be58abbc68c6e02b2e9c5d7cdaba8e4d horizon added a
receiver for django_compressor's post_compress signal. This reciever
expects context to have current_theme populated as THEME variable.
This variable is not passed down to murano-dashboards templates due to
the way block inheritance works in django.
In some situations this causes murano-dashboard to raise 500 exceptions,
since murano-dashboard uses compress tags separately to compress its
static files.

This commit adds tag calls that populate THEME variable before each call
to compress.

Falling back to environment variable credentials is convenient for
development but could lead to unexpected credentials being used during
tests. Also this is not a known practice for tempest tests.

This change removes the env var defaults and explicitly sets the
credentials to use in prepare_test_env.sh.

Pre and post grenade tests also get their config from the conf file
rather than the environment.

pci_requests are now stashed in the migration context we
can deprecate it.

The top leve MysqlRootPassword is still maintained by default
in overcloud.yaml so that users who upgrade won't get
broken. New users may optionally specify the MysqlRootPassword
as a parameter instead which will take priority over the top
level generated parameter.

We drop the top level MysqlClusterUniquePart because it is no
longer used (I think it was a remnant from t-i-e).

1. What is the problem
After recent updates now Neutron uses pluggable IPAM driver backend by default,
while in the unit tests for network functionality in the Tricircle, unpluggable
IPAM driver backend is assumed to be used. So this default backend change causes
most of the unit tests fail.

2. What is the solution to the problem
In the setup of unit tests, set ""ipam_driver"" option as empty string to use
unpluggable IPAM driver backend.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
   to realize the solution
No new feature introduced.

This change adds new GrubPassword module to the fuelmenu which can
configure password for the editing grub menu. The module creates the
default /boot/grub2/user.cfg file with hashed password only when it
entered interactively. For security reasons the plain password never
stored and the file always overwritten with new one provided.

Currently, when a user makes an API call to list resources, they were
retrieved from the currently active template associated with the
stack. This worked in the legacy engine where no concurrent updates
where possible. With convergence and thus concurrent updates, a stack
is allowed to have resources of previous traversals and still continue
creating new resources. Therefore, relying on the template to list
resources won't exactly match the state in the database.

For example, on deletes where we update with an empty template,
currently, the stack parses the empty template searching for
resources. Doing a `resource-list` when the stack is in a state of
DELETE_IN_PROGRESS shows an empty list of resources and therefore not
matching the state in the database.

This change makes iter_resources always call _find_filtered_resources
which builds all its resources from a database query.

When we perform a local delete in the compute API during the volumes
cleanup, Nova calls the volume_api.terminate_connection passing a fake
volume connector. That call is useless and it has no real effect on the
volume server side.

With a686185fc02ec421fd27270a343c19f668b95da6 in mitaka we started
stashing the connector in the bdm.connection_info so this change
tries to use that if it's available, which it won't be for attachments
made before that change -or- for volumes attached to an instance in
shelved_offloaded state that were never unshelved (because the actual
volume attach for those instances happens on the compute manager after
you unshelve the instance).

If we can't find a stashed connector, or we find one whose host does
not match the instance.host, we punt and just don't call
terminate_connection at all since calling it with a fake connector
can actually make some cinder volume backends fail and then the
volume is orphaned.

The server listing API raises a 500 error if you pass an invalid status
filter for admin user. In the case of a non-admin user, it simply
returns an empty list. In the case of an admin user, it fetches extended
server attributes, so a condition was added to get extended server
attributes only when servers list is not empty.

This change simply removes the cause of the 500 exception. A subsequent
patch with a microversion bump will modify the behavior so that a 400
Bad Request will be raised for an invalid status, for both admin and
non-admin alike.

1. What is the problem
The current Nova_APIGW does not support microversion function, the service
controller uses a fixed API version number to initialize novaclient

2. What is the solution to the problem
When the service controller receives an API request, it will get the
microversion number from request headers , and use this to initialize
novaclient.

For how to get the microversion number, please refer to:
https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/kilo/implemented/api-microversions.html

The microversion supported range is 2.36 to latest version

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
   to realize the solution

This addresses the issue when the user wishes to update the CPU
or memory of the instance.

No changes to disks will be done if there is no root disk.

Examples of when there is no root disk:
1. When an instance is booted from a cinder volume.
2. When booting from an ISO and the root disk size is zero

In these cases there will not be a disk created on the vmware
shared datastore.

This reverts commit 39e4dd9a1539a2387beb0e1e8940a4e515608dc9.

As the commit had multiple db migration problems,
it's better to revert it for now and try again after
enabling tests. [1]

Everything except for OSC installs before plugins, then plugins run.
That's great, because if a devstack plugin needs to do something
explicit with the software installed, it can. But then OSC gets
installed and can step on the install that was done by the plugin.

Just move it to before the plugin, so that plugins can have the final
say on versions of things installed.

During Austin Summit it was decided that we should change approved specs
approach to Job Distribution for Active-Active configurations.

This patch updates the specs to use the concept of cluster instead of
using the host and adding the concept of nodes as agreed during the
design session.

It also moves the spec to Ocata to make sure there's no confusion on
whether this is implemented or not.

The callback manager was indexing callbacks based on
a callback ID generated from oslo utils reflection.
This presented two problems.

The first was that in py34 get_callable_name would use
__qualname__ which returns the class name the function
is defined on rather than the class of the object itself.
So two classes defined in the same module inheriting from
the same parent class could not both subscribe a method
defined on the parent.

The second more general problem is that two objects which
are instances of the same class cannot subscribe the same
method because they have the same ID.

This adds the hash of the method to the ID to prevent these
issues. The hash by itself could have been used but it's not
very user-friendly so the name is left on for nice log
messages.

Commit 602ddac914b3d4cf15864f2d4b4c042eab84bcb0 changed the prefix
of some commands from '$' to '#' to signal that these commands should
be executed as root user. These commands are in a sphinx 'bash' code
block and get rendered as comments.
This change uses the sphinx 'shell-session' code block which renders
these root commands correctly.

Usually, datasources pull data for all tables defined in the driver.
It sometime causes a performance issue when no policy rule refers the
table but the table takes long time to pull data.

This patch introduces 'lazy_tables' flag to PollingDataSourceDriver
which suspends to pull data until another service subscribes the table.
Admin can specify the flag only when they create a new datasource and
only for dse2 now. This allows nova_driver to accept lazy_tables flag
as a first implementation.

Sample command:

 $ openstack congress datasource create --config lazy_tables=[""flavors""] \
    --config <some option for openstack> nova nova

introduced and the original ""dig"" in the stdlib was renamed
to dig44.

The dig function from the stdlib doesn't support :undef values

based on the ""dig44"" but has some improvements needed for
Puppet4.5+.

Added 6 base classes which may be inherited by app developers to
utilize the benefits of Application Development Framework:

* SingleServerApplication - an app which is a software component of
  its own and expects a single server as an input. Deploys itself on
  this server.

* MultiServerApplication - an app which is a software component of its
  own. Expects a ServerGroup as an input. Deploys itself on all
  servers of this group.

* MultiServerApplicationWithScaling - same as MultiServerApplication
  but also capable of scaling in and out.

* MasterSlaveApplication - a composite application which consists of a
  'Master' and 'Slave' software comonents and two ServerGroup's (the
  second one being optional). First installs the 'Master' component on
  the first group, then - the 'Slave' component on the second (or the
  first, if the second group is not specified)

* MasterSlaveApplicationWithMasterScaling - same as
  MasterSlaveApplication but also capable of scaling its 'master'
  group in and out.

* MasterSlaveApplicationWithSlaveScaling - same as
  MasterSlaveApplication but also capable of scaling its 'slave' group
  in and out.

Both MasterSlaveApplicationWithMasterScaling and
MasterSlaveApplicationWithSlaveScaling can be inherited by a single
class to achieve both master and slave scaling capabilities.

Right now we assign 1000 to the oldest nodes and 1 to others. That
creates a problem when Master restarts and no node is promoted until
that node starts back. In that case the returned node will have score
of 1, like all other slaves and Pacemaker will select to promote it
again. The node is clean empty and afterwards other slaves join to
it, wiping their data as well. As a result, we loose all the messages.

The new algorithm actually ranks nodes, not just selects the oldest
one. It also maintains the invariant that if node A started later
than node B, then node A score must be smaller than that of
node B. As a result, freshly started node has no chance of being
selected in preference to older node. If several nodes start
simultaneously, among them an older node might temporarily receive
lower score than a younger one, but that is neglectable.

Also remove any action on demote or demote notification - all of
these duplicate actions done in stop or stop notification. With these
removed, changing master on a running cluster does not affect RabbitMQ
cluster in any way - we just declare another node master and that is
it. It is important for the current change because master score might
change after initial cluster start up causing master migration from
one node to another.

Previous split brain logic worked as follows: each slave checked
that it is connected to master. If check fails, slave restarts. The
ultimate flaw in that logic is that there is little guarantee that
master is alive at the moment. Moreover, if master dies, it is very
probable that during the next monitor check slaves will detect its
death and restart, causing complete RabbitMQ cluster downtime.

With the new approach master node checks that slaves are connected to
it and orders them to restart if they are not. The check is performed
after master node health check, meaning that at least that node
survives. Also, orders expire in one minute and freshly started node
ignores orders to restart for three minutes to give cluster time to
stabilize.

Also corrected the problem, when node starts and is already clustered.
In that case OCF script forgot to start the RabbitMQ app, causing
subsequent restart. Now we ensure that RabbitMQ app is running.

The two introduced attributes rabbit-start-phase-1-time and
rabbit-ordered-to-restart are made private. In order to allow master
to set node's order to restart, both ocf_update_private_attr and
ocf_get_private_attr signatures are expanded to allow passing
node name.

Finally, a bug is fixed in ocf_get_private_attr. Unlike crm_attribute,
attrd_updater returns empty string instead of ""(null)"", when an
attribute is not defined on needed node, but is defined on some other
node. Correspondingly changed code to expect empty string, not a
""(null)"".

This is a Mitaka patch only because in master we use composable services
and don't have this problem.

The bootstrap-ansible script is failing with a Python backtrace as it
fails to parse the ""ndg-httpsclient>=0.4.2;python_version<'3.0'"" line in
requirements.txt properly.

Commit c904de2db512 ""Isolate Ansible from the deployment host""
introduced the separation of Ansible into a virtualenv. Even though pip
is updated and placed under /usr/local/bin, the system's package is the
version which is copied into the virtualenv (version 1.5.4 in Ubuntu
14.04).

Commit ab887ee13def ""Include python requirements to resolve SNI issue
for Ansible venv"" introduced a python_version environment marker to the
ndg-httpsclient line in requirements.txt file. This is a feature which
was added in pip version 6.0 and is therefore not supported by the older
version being run in the virtualenv.

This patch uses the system's version of pip which is installed into the
virtualenv, to update itself to the latest version. This way we can
ensure that we are using the correct version of pip which supports
environment markers and other newer features.
