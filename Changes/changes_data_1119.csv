* There is a possible deadlock scenario in our plugin which
  can be fixed by retries. This is the issue:
    1) a plugin API call grabs the database transaction lock
    2) the plugin then block while making an HTTP call to the
       midonet server.
    3) another plugin API call comes in and tries to get the
       transaction lock, but times out because the other thread
       holds the lock.
* This is possible because neutrons threading implementation does not
  allow for context switching out of a thread that is blocked trying
  to obtain the DB transaction lock.
* This can be worked around by simply retrying calls that have timed
  out.

When an IPv6 address is added to an interface, it
goes into a tentative state for a couple of seconds
for duplicate address detection. During this time,
use of the address will fail. This is an issue for
functional tests where they may add an address to
an interface and then immediately run a ping and
expect success.

This patch adds a new wait_until_address_ready function
to ip_lib that will poll the interface every 200 ms until
the status transitions off of tentative or until a time limit
is exceeded. If the time limit is exceeded, it will raise an
exception.

It also adds unit tests and updates a functional test to
make use of the new feature.

Currently, the event-list output is very resource-centric, despite
being scoped to the stack from an API path perspective.

This, combined with the fact that the stack updated_at timestamp
is only updated after a succesful update (ref bug #1193269) makes
it impossible to derive the time when an update started via any API.

This is a problem when trying to use the new hook/breakpoint API,
because it's necessary to poll for all events since the most recent
update started, disregarding any stale hook events from previous
updates (which may have failed or timed out without the hooks getting
cleared).

To work around this, add an event for each stack state transition,
such that you can detect the transition to UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS,
then use that event as a marker to get post-update-started events.

Without this (or some other way to determine when the stack update
started), the hooks pre-update functionality landed for kilo is
not really usable (particularly mechanically via scripts).

Multi-patch set for easier chunks. This one addresses
the openstack cinder directory. That directory is synced
from oslo, so no changes made. Translation markers are
being used, so this just removes the hacking check
exclusion of that directory.

Some cleanup of a couple files are also included in this
patch for other directories that had been previously
covered.

There have been quite a few instances found where the
i18n guidelines are not being followed. I believe this
has helped lead to some of the confusion around how to
correctly do this. Other developers see this code and
assume it is an example of the correct usage.

This patch attempts to clean up most of those violations
in the existing codebase to hopefully help avoid some of
that confusion in reviews.

Some issues address:
* Correct log translation markers for different log levels
* Passing format values as arguments to call, not preformatting
* Not forcing translation via six.text_type and others

Guidelines can be found here:
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.i18n/guidelines.html

Hacking checks will not be able to identify all violations of
the guidelines, but it could be useful for catching obvious
one such as LOG.info(""No markers!"").

Refactor horizon Angular modules to have a consistent naming
scheme and a matching directory structure.

Basic theory:
1) /horizon is the root ""horizon"" module
2) /horizon/horizon/static/framework contains the reusable Angular components
   in the ""horizon.framework"" module (no specific business logic). These
   components are used to build horizon-based UIs (like openstack_dashboard).
3) /horizon/horizon/static/hz-app contains the ""bootstrap"" logic
   for the openstack_dashboard UI, bringing in all required modules for the
   application (namely ""horizon.framework"". In the future, this ""application""
   module will likely move out of horizon and into its own application directory
3) /horizon/openstack_dashboard/static/dashboard contains the ""core"" logic
   for the openstack_dashboard UI in the ""horizon.dashboard"" module.
5) openstack_dashboard/enabled/_10_project.py brings in all the source
   needed by that specific project dashboard. Source that is used by multiple
   dashboards is currently included using horizon/_scripts.html.
6) Directory structure is based on module hierarchy. Code that lives
   in the module ""horizon.framework.widget.wizard"" is placed in the directory
   horizon/horizon/static/framework/widget/
7) API code move to openstack_dashboard/static/dashboard/api to better
   match the location of API support in the Python code

Add more dictionary methods to VersionedObjectDictCompat:

 * __iter__()
 * keys(), iterkeys()
 * values(), itervalues()

Thanks to new methods, dict constructor now accepts
VersionedObjectDictCompat: it's possible to write directly dict(obj)
instead of having to write dict(obj.iteritems()).

On Python 3, items() now returns an iterator instead of a list, to
respect Python 3 dictionary API, as the new keys() and values() methods.

Keep iterkeys(), itervalues() and iteritems() on Python 3, even if
Python 3 dictionaries don't have these methods, just to ease the
transition from Python 2 to Python 3 in Nova.

This adds functional tests to tox, along with a number of prerequisite
steps. Since this is primarily a bash project, pbr usage has been avoided.
Tests are to be written in python and put in the tests directory.

Running tox -e setupenv will execute a setup script
(tests/setup_docker.sh) to ensure the running instance of docker meets
the minimum version requirement.

Running tox -e images will execute the image building script
(tools/build-all-docker-images) and will parse the resulting output to report
failures.

Running tox -e startenv will generate the environment file, run
""tools/kolla start"", and run first time initialization (eventually).

Running tox -e functional is for actually testing the deployed OpenStack
environment via a series of tests utilizing the client APIs.

VersionedObjectDictCompat code come from Nova. While Nova may drop the
dictionary compatibility, dropping a class in a library requires a
deprecation process, so notes are not really usefull.

Remove also useless docstrings: in oslo_versionedobjects, there is no
really ""backward compatibility"" issue since it's a new library. Again,
docstrings came from Nova, but I consider them useless in this library.

Replace also ""compat"" with ""compatibility"" in VersionedObjectDictCompat

This is the second patch set in a series refactoring code that
uses ResourceTracker.compute_node so that it can later be changed
to be a ComputeNode object. Note that in this patch compute_node
is still a dict.

The methods that calculate resource usage in the ResourceTracker
take a parameter called (variously) resources, values or stats.
Sometimes these are called passing self.compute_node as the value
for this parameter and sometimes a dict data structure obtained
from the virt driver by the get_available_resources() method.
The result of the changes are always copied into the
self.compute_node.

This mixing of data structures won't work if self.compute_node is
converted to be a ComputeNode object instead of a dict. The
previous patch in this series initialises self.compute_node at
the start of _update_available_resources() so it has a value at
the outset. This patch copies the resources data into
self.compute_node and uses only that data structure in the methods
that calculate resource usage. As a consequence it is no longer
necessary to pass this in as a parameter in those methods or to
copy the result into self.compute_node at the end of the
calculations.

This step will allow us, in following patches, to convert the code
in the update methods to object notiation when self.compute_node
is changed to be an object instread of a dict.

Minor changes included are removal the final copy into
compute_node and moving initialisation of the stats plugin
into _init_compute_node().

- ClusterController.action had some code paths which would

  - It has scope of only one action but still has the code to raise exception

    this was probably coming from copy from management-instance-controller

- Rewrote the logic to find action from request body,

Previously, we were using the instance's name verbatim to generate the
name of its config ISO.  Since the format of the instance name is very
permissive, this can lead to rejection of the name by the PowerVM REST
API:

Value 'Linux Test_0ce757b1_thorst_config.iso' is not facet-valid with
respect to pattern '([A-Za-z0-9_\.]{1,79})' for type 'FileName.Pattern'.

This change set exploits a new pypowervm utility to sanitize the
instance name and combine it with the desired prefix and suffix to
generate a valid config ISO name.

The same is being done for an instance's boot/rescue disks and image LUs
(for SSP).

if you wish to create Neutron networks for the undercloud

JSON to do so. Creating networks with Heat has the benefit
of being parameter driven so that users can quickly
enable networks using the resource registry and parameters.

There are 5 networks to start with which are roughly modeled
around networks an Overcloud user might want to use to isolate
their traffic. The intent is to make these opt-in and
configurable for end users.

The networks.yaml template can be used to create all of the
networks using parameters in the resource registry.

Currently radvd is spawned in all the HA routers irrespective of the
state of the router. This approach has the following issues.

1. While processing the internal router ports (i.e., qr-xxx), ha_router
   removes the LLA of the interface and adds it as a VIP to Keepalived conf.
   Radvd daemon is spawned after this operation in the router namespace
   (if the port is associated with any IPv6 subnets). Radvd notices that
   qr-xxx interface does not have the LLA, so does not transmit any Router
   Advts. In this state, VMs fail to acquire IPv6 addresses because of the
   missing RAs. Radvd does not recover even after keepalived configures the
   LLA of the interface. The only solution is to restart/reload radvd daemon.
   Currently keepalived-state-change monitor does not do any radvd related
   operations when a state transition happens. So we endup in this state
   forever.
2. For all the routers in Backup state, qr-xxx interface does not have LLA
   as it is managed by keepalived and configured only on the Master HA router.
   In such agents syslog is flooded with the messages [1] and this can cause
   loss of other useful info.
   [1] - resetting ipv6-allrouters membership on qr-2e373555-97

This patch implements the following.
1. If the router is already in the Master state, we configure the LLA as a VIP
   in keepalived conf but do not delete the LLA of the internal interface.
2. We spawn radvd only if the router is in the Master State.
3. Keepalived-state-change monitor takes care of enabling/disabling radvd upon
   state transitions.

There is no simple way working on Python 2 and Python 3 to get the
message of an exception as a Unicode string. This new functions uses an
heuristic to get the encoding of the exception message. It tries UTF-8
(which is a superset of ASCII), the locale encoding, or fallback to
ISO-8859-1 (which never fails).

This function is required to log exceptions using the logging module
when the exception message contains non-ASCII characters.

- logging.log() only works with non-ASCII characters on Python 2 and
  Python 3 if the message is formatted as Unicode. For example,
  logging.log(b'error: %s', b'\xe9') fails in most cases.
- unicode % bytes doesn't work with non-ASCII characters
- logging.log(u'error: %s', exc) doesn't work if the exception message
  contains a non-ASCII character

Only logging.log(u'error: %s', exception_to_unicode(exc)) works in all
cases: ASCII or non-ASCII exception message, Python 2 and Python 3.

This change updates the vscsi.py to not send the adapter down when
requesting that the scsi adapter be connected.  This was due to a recent
change in pypowervm, and the refactor was missed in the nova-powervm
code.

An additional unit test was added to cover this.

The NotifyPublisher was redeclaring again and again,
the same exchange and queue each times a notification is sent.

This change fixes that by caching the already declared exchange
and queue for each channel.

Also, to make the test pass. 'Connection.ensure' have been updated
to have the same behavior for amqp and memory driver about
kombu recoverable_errors. And the hostname and port of the memory
driver are set to not fail when we print a log message.

The two tox environments were large and mostly duplicated, use a shell
script instead and use the build-rst.sh script to simplify building and
publishing.

For copying to /kilo, use the tools/copy-to-branch.sh script instead of
the simple commands since that is more robust. Merge that script into
this script, no need for a second script.

Update requirements: We need 0.27 at least to not have to delete the
Debian Install Guide, sync also pbr with global-requirements.txt.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

This is an almost complete rewrite of the installation script, mainly
directed to allow installation of Rally also from unprivileged users,
but also adding a few more options and checks.

More in details, the script now:

* can run as unprivileged user.
* support different database types
* allow to specify custom python binary
* always asks confirmation before doing potentially dangerous actions
  (removing directories or installing software)
* automatically install needed software if run as root
* this script is self-sufficient: it automatically downloads Rally
  from the git if needed
* if interrupted, cleans up the virtualenv and/or the downloaded repository

In order to provide better error handling around configured external
services, we are adding additional checks to some deployment tasks
where we know that there are either external services or services
that can be user configurable.

*) Adding a repository connectivity test task to be run after
netconfig to ensure that software repository access is OK before
proceeding with the rest of the deployment.
*) Adding in post connectivity tests before NTP server to ensure that
those services will be able to reach the configured settings.

With this change, we are adding two custom puppet functions
(url_available and ntp_available) to the osnailyfacter module. These
functions will throw a Puppet::Error if unable to properly
communicate with the services.

Currently init_l3 retrieves the list of global addresses from the kernel

not in the ip_cidrs argument to init_l3, they will be deleted. The
problem with only listing global addresses is that if a site-local or

to later delete the address, init_l3 will never consider that address
for deletion.

To fix this, init_l3 should not limit its scope when listing addresses

Neutron and should not be deleted.

This patch addresses 3 issues.
1. compute the string representation of the object of Server Resource correctly.
__repr()__ built-in function of a object will be called when a caller return
the object.
So the string representation must be evaluated correctly.
ref:
https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__

2. encode server human_id before find the expected Server.
urlencode will encode human_id to a safe url.
But an unicode object can not be encoded to a safe url, or an
UnicodeEncodeError will be raised.

3. keep the server name/display_name as unicode.
Server name typed by user from the terminal will be used as a filter to be
compared with the instance name from the nova API. They should be same type.
The instance name are unicode, so the server name should be same.

Also the server name/display_name will be used to populate list_kwargs.
We should make sure all the values of the list_kwargs should not be unicode in
order that it can be encoded to a safe url by urlencode.

After this patch you can create a instance by protal with an no-ascii name,
such as 'αβγ'.
And you can delete it successfully by this command:
$ nova --debug delete αβγ

Some of the scheduler filters directly access the Nova database to
retrieve information about host aggregates. This is problematic for a
couple reasons:

* In order to detach the nova-scheduler into the Gantt project, we need
  to isolate the scheduler from the Nova database.
* The way in which aggregates are accessed is quiet inefficient.
  Aggregate metadata is queried *on each iteration of host_passes()*,
  inside various filters that query for metadata assigned to aggregates
  that a compute node might belong to. For deployments with lots of
  compute nodes and/or lots of aggregates, this can lead to hundreds of
  separate DB requests in a single launch instance request.

This patch caches Aggregate information in the
nova.scheduler.host_state_manager.HostStateManager object, and provides
read-only aggregate information in the manager's collection of HostState
objects. A HostState object is what is passed to the filter's
host_passes() method, and we replace the calls to the Nova database for
aggregate information with calls to the cached aggregate information in
the HostState object instead.

We don't fully remove the database calls to retrieve Aggregate
information in this patch, though. We still call
nova.objects.AggregateList.get_all() in the constructor of the
HostStateManager. However, in a future patch, we now only need to
replace this single call to the Nova database with an alternate way of
getting Aggregate information. We could instead call the Nova REST API
to get the information, or better, in the future, Gantt would own all
the information about Aggregates, and we would replace the call to
Nova's database with a simple call to Gantt's data store instead.

When doing backup on a vm which boot from cinder volume, it firstly
shutdown vm and then do backup work. But it fails and the detail exception
log could be seen in the last part. When we need nova to backup a vm
booted from cinder volume, we could do this by using cinder's function----copy
volume to image. I think we could raise an exception when nova backup a vm
from cinder volume.

Commit I635e017c7f9ab61812333983bfecccd6fce8d394 added client support for
sorting using the --sort <key>[:<direction>] syntax and invoked the server
using repeating 'sort_key' and 'sort_dir' parameters.

The server is adopting the sorting syntax guidelines defined in [1] and
removing support for repeating 'sort_key' and 'sort_dir' parameters in patch
set [2]; this patch set makes the corresponding parameter change in the
client.

Patch set contains:
* Switching from the 'sort_key' and 'sort_dir' query string parameters to
  the single 'sort' parameter
* Removing the default sort direction, relying on the default to be set on
  the server

WIP until server patch [2] is merged.

The attachment of the interface was a 'call'. This blocks the API
until the compute node has completed the operation. In some cases
when the compute node was under load this would take about a minute.
This means that the API is blocked for that period of time. The
application attaching the interface should not be blocked. If the
issue is waiting for an IP address etc., then application should be
developed to take into account standard network operations - for
example it make take a few seconds to get a DHCP address.

This change is only valid for the V3 API. The V2 API cannot be
updated as we need to ensure backwards compatibility.

DocImpact
 - V3 API for interface attachment will return 202 instead of 200

In quota, -1 is used to express an unlimited value. To get a settable
quota range, it is necessary to use helper methods to handle unlimited
values. Even if it is fixed, 'remains' is not enough. 'Remains' means
the amount of a project quota which is not allocated to users. When a
project quota is unlimited, the 'remains' is always unlimited. To get
settable minimum value to the project, the sum of allocated quotas to
users is calculated from 'limit' and 'remains'. When the project limit
is unlimited, the allocated quotas cannot be got.

This patch uses helper methods considering unlimited values to
calculate a settable quota range.
The patch also replaces 'remains' with 'allocated'. 'allocated' means
the sum of user quotas which are set explicitly. 'Allocated' could be
used as a minimum value of a settable project quota range.

Commit eec0937af9d88f3c7ffacf9ce7b8955b2e4be479 fixed the case
when shared storage was in use and resize-revert was called using
the _is_instance_storage_shared method.  However, in the case of
non-shared storage, this method will still return 'True' inside
of revert_resize.

`revert_resize` is called on the target node, since it is
the current 'host' of the instance once the resize or migration
operation has completed, but before `finish_revert_resize` is called.
(i.e. when the instance is in the RESIZE_CONFIRM state).
`is_instance_storage_shared` first directly calls
check_instance_shared_storage_local (creating the canary file
on the target compute node), and the uses the RPC API to call
check_instance_shared_storage.  However, the RPC API calls
check_instance_shared_storage on the current host of the given
instance, which is again the target compute node, so the canary
file is always present.

Instead, we now specify that the 'remote' node in this case is
not the current host of the instance, but the migration source
node.

Network.save() updated network.host in a separate db operation and
transaction to other fields. This change makes Network.save() use a
single, atomic database operation for updates by folding the previous
behaviour of network_set_host into network_update. We replicate the
previous compare-and-update behaviour of network_set_host by moving it
into the database update statement. This has the advantages of being
race-free and using fewer db round trips.

We remove network_set_host as there are no remaining users outside of
test code. All tests are updated accordingly. Test updates are of
varying complexity, and summarised below:

* db/test_db_api.py:

Purely mechanical update. network_set_host becomes network_update,
passing host in values. Additionally, network_set_host previously
returned a value, which network_update does not. Instead, we re-fetch
the network from the db and test the host.

* network/test_manager.py, nova/tests/unit/api/ec2/test_cloud.py

These tests were affected by the change in the behaviour of
network_update wrt host. Previously, host was not passed to
network_update() as it was handled by network_set_host() instead.  The
tests were using network_update() to avoid the special handling of
network_set_update(). The tests are updated mechanically to take
account of the change. Additionally, I have audited the code for
callers of network_update which pass host, and therefore might be
affected by the behaviour change. There should not be any, but there
is one: nova.cmd.manage.NetworkCommands.modify. It only sets host to
None, so it is unaffected by the change.

* objects/test_network.py

Purely mechanical update to tests which expected save to call
network_set_host.

* db/fakes.py, api/openstack/compute/contrib/test_cloudpipe_update.py

Removed fakes for network_set_host, and updated network_update with
new behaviour.

Now that nova-network and neutronv2 APIs are returning the same keys
required for the _format_address method we can remove the is_neutron
check in the code.

The existing tests that hit this method were doing a
allocate/describe/release but without actually checking the formatted
output of the address response and without using a fixed IP, so this
change also adds some more specific tests to verify the logic in
_format_address and updates the method to handle nova objects a bit
cleaner.

With this change in place we can start converting the neutronv2 API's
get_floating_ip* methods to use nova objects.

This adds a flag to NovaObject that controls whether an object class
becomes the default implementation in nova.objects.Class. Right now,
if it's newer than the current default, it wins. In an upgrade scenario,
that may not be what we want. This flag lets us decide when a version
may be registered, but not considered the default.

We use an upgrade_levels.object config option, which can be set to a
release codename. Object subclasses can declare which release they
are appropriate for, so that we only default them if their release
is active. In the case of a Juno->Kilo upgrade, some objects which are
v2.0 resets will only register if the upgrade level is ""kilo"".

The contextlib.nested call has been deprecated
in Python 2.7. This causes DeprecationWarning
messages in the unit tests.

There are also known issues with contextlib.nested
that were addressed by the native support for
multiple ""with"" variables. For instance, if the
first object is created but the second one throws
an exception, the first object's __exit__ is never
called. For more information see
https://docs.python.org/2/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.nested
contextlib.nested is also not compatible in Python 3.

Since Nova no longer supports 2.6 we can remove
the use of these contextlib.nested calls.

Added hacking check to catch if any new instances
are added to the codebase.

Note: line continuation markers (e.g. '\') had to
be used or syntax errors were thrown. While using
parentheses is the preferred way for multiple line
statements it is not a requirement.

When errors occur after driver.live_migrate has completed, it generally
leaves things in a very inconsistent state.

Firstly we should update the node and host of the instance as soon as
possible. Should any error occur, at least the system will know where
the instance currently resides.

Secondly, we should ensure that when an exception is raised after
driver.live_migrate has completed, we put the instance into the ERROR
state and reset the task state. If we don't do that, the VM tends to be
left in the MIGRATING state, and you need to dig in the logs to find out
that an error has happened.

For testing purpose I have added request_utils directly in

This commit adds support for checking and resizing filesystems

a mounter (since the VFS will either us libguestfs or a mounter
anyway) and is still behind the same config option.

Since we already spin up a VFS instance when running
is_image_partitionless, is_image_partitionless has been
refactored to take an optional `if_so` argument.  If `if_so`
is specified, it will be run when the image has been determined
to be partitionless.  However, when testing COW images, `if_so`
will be called before the VFS is shut down, with the VFS instance
as the second argument to `if_so`, allowing us to reused the existing
VFS instead.

This can be used to avoid cases like the libvirt driver qcow2 resize
code, which first converts the image from qcow2 to raw, operates
on it, and then converts back.

The support for video memory and number of displays is
provided in both spawn and resize operations.

This patch supports only spawn. A subsequent patch will
support resize operation

3D Support can be set to an instance only if both image and flavor
contain 3D support.
This is done to ensure that instances can have 3D support only
if the admin allows such instances.

The 3D support for the instance can be set in the image property using
glance image-update --property hw_video_3d=True <image-uuid>

The 3D support in flavor can be set using
nova flavor-key <flavor-id> set hw_video:video_3d

This patch provides a filter scheduler for performing
calculations using video memory.

If any hypervisor allocates video memory either partly or fully
on the host memory, then this filter can be used for
scheduler calculations.

Behaviour of VMWare vCenter for video memory allocation ---

The video memory allocation in vCenter  is evenly divided
- Half the video memory is reserved on the hardware GPU,
  while the other half is reserved via host RAM.

if however video memory is not available on hardware GPU,
the vCenter sets the video memory on host RAM

The vCenter does not provide any API which returns
the free video memory on the hardware GPU.
Hence when a instance requires video memory,
the scheduler calculation for a valid host can happen
on the free host memory since vCenter by default uses
host memory if video memory on hardware GPU is not available.

This patch adds the video memory to the requested RAM
for performing the scheduler calculation.

The filter is generic and can be used by any other hypervisors
which have a similar behaviour

This filter is applied only when the flavor
has a extra spec hw_video:video_ram

Support for video memory for VMWare instances is
in review.

This change allows to configure that in nova, so the XML generated for

Everything is done exactly like the disk_cachemode, per

This commit aims to support the creation of the galera cluster via
Pacemaker. With this commit in, three use-cases will be supported.

 * Non HA setup / Non Pacemaker setup : The deployment will take place
as it is currently the case in f20puppet-nonha. Nothing changes.

 * Non HA setup / Pacemaker setup : Even though it is a non ha setup,
galera cluster via pacemaker  will be deployed with a cluster nbr of 1.

 * HA setup / Non Pacemaker setup : N/A

 * HA setup / Pacemaker setup : It is assumed that HA setup will
always be with pacemaker.  So in this situation pacemaker will deploy a
cluster of 3 galera master nodes.

This change introduces a common get API that can be applied to every
proxy method that revolves around get a single resource. In particular,
the change applies that base method to getting a single server.

The method takes either a resource or an ID and calls `get` on the
corresponding resource, after obtaining the canonical ID for that value
out of Resource.get_id. The ID is passed to the _check_resource
decorator so we're only making the get call on the appropriate type of
resource, if given. When given a string ID, we have to try it.

What?
- appdirs provides platform independent knowledge of appropriate
  directories to use for applications. For instance, instead of
  put in an env reference to XDG_ variables, you can use appdirs and get
  not only the XDG_ dirs on linux, but the analogs on OSX and Windows.

Usage?
- os-client-config
- python-ironicclient

Is the library actively maintained?
- Last modified Aug 2014. The company ActiveState is behind it.

Is the library good code?
- It's neither the best nor worst code I've seen. Its documented well.

Is the library python 3 compatible?
- Yes

Is the library license compatible?
- Yes, MIT licensed

Is the library already packaged in the distros we target?
- https://packages.debian.org/sid/python-appdirs
- https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-appdirs
- Does *not* currently seem to exist in fedora

Is the function of this library already covered by other
libraries in ``global-requirements.txt``?
- No

The patch changes the approach of resource backup during stack
update. It stores the definition of resource that needs to be
updated in-place to backup stack(if it was not created before).

Without this functionality, InvalidTemplateReference will be thrown
every time when update-replaced resource has a reference to updated
in-place resource and stack update was failed. In this case, backup
stack has a resource that refers to not-presented another resource
and backup stack deletion generates an exception.

The pbr setup_hook has not been needed for a while, so remove it.  The
neutron hook has been broken for a while: it places a setup_requires
build dependency on everything in neutron/__init__.py, which is
non-empty, but setup_requires is handled by easy install so we try
very hard to avoid it. Instead, we can use environment markers to
selectively include the win32 dependencies without requiring that
neutron be importable during setup.py execution. This is unusual
in OpenStack and will eventually be moved to a regular
requirements.txt dependency with the same marker - once we've finished
the integration work to make markers work properly in
requirements.txt.

Reusing the MutableMapping abstract base class in
VersionedObjectDictCompat to not have to reimplement all dictionary
methods. Only implement __getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__, __iter__
and __len__.

dict(obj.iteritems()) can now be simplified to dict(obj).

Remove also notes previously copied from Nova. Since
oslo.versionedobjects is now a library, removing a class now requires a
deprecation warning which is more useful than a note. Removing the
dictionary API from VersionedObjectDictCompat doesn't make sense. Nova
may drop the dictionary API from Nova objects, but not the
VersionedObjectDictCompat class.

This change adds also Python 3 support. On Python 3, MutableMapping
defines correctly items() and keys() methods: return iterators, not
list.

The change removes VersionedObjectDictCompat.iteritems() on Python 3. No
OpenStack application using oslo.versionedobjects is compatible with
Python 3, so this change has no impact of backward compatibility. The
class didn't have iterkeys() or itervalues() methods.

Commit https://review.openstack.org/#/c/162999/ changed where the Hyper-V
VM configuration files are stored. The files are being stored in the same
folder as the instance. Performing a cold resize / migration will cause a
os.rename call on the instance's folder, which fails as long as there are
configuration files used by Hyper-V in that folder, thus resulting in a
failed migration and the instance ending up in ERROR state.

Hyper-V configuration files are stored in a subfolder of the instance's
folder (e.g.: C:\OpenStack\Instances\instance-000000b6\Virtual Machines).

This commit makes sure that Hyper-V configuration files are not being
moved during migration by skipping subfolders in the instance's folder.

unexpected instance reboots are not handled at all.

After an instance is stopped, suspended or paused, the console log
workers are stopped as well as the serial console pipe is closed.
Those workers are never restarted unless a power change is triggered
by the manager.

This patch proposes an instance state event listener, emiting events
that can be handled by the manager, similar to the Libvirt driver
workflow.

Hyper-V provides a solid interface for accessing serial ports via
named pipes, already employed in the Nova serial console log
implementation.
This patch makes use of this interface by implementing a simple TCP
socket proxy, providing access to instance serial console ports.

Currently v2 and v2.1 have separate functional tests and their
corresponding sample files. As v2 and v2.1 are supposed to be identical,
there is overhead to maintain two set of functional tests and sample files.
We can have one set of tests which can run for both v2 and v2.1.

This commit merges servers actions migrate, live migrate server
functional tests.

In V2.1 os-access-ip is separate plugin where in v2 it was mixed in server
plugin itself. So os-access-ip extension is enabled to run
merged functional tests for both v2 and v2.1.

delete_subnet in Ml2 plugin instead of using SELECT FOR
UPDATE deletes the IPAllocations that can be auto-deleted
straight away.
An exception is raised if there are ports that cannot be
autodeleted.

delete_network in ML2 plugin tries to delete all ports
and subnets before performing the network deletion.
No lock is needed here - if some other process modifies
the Port or Subnet table, adding new items, the network
deletion will fail because of a violation of a foreign
key contraint.
In that case the operation will be retried.

first router in the tenant was always being chosen. This patch adds back

This patch fixes a race-condition that occurs when the
scheduler tries to check for dvr serviceable ports before
it schedules a router when a subnet is associated with
a router.

Sometimes the dhcp port creation is delayed and so the
router is not scheduled to the l3-agent.

Also it boosts the scheduling performance on dvr-snat
node for scheduling a router.

This patch will provide a work around to fix this race
condition and to boost the scheduling performance
by scheduling a router on a dvr-snat when
dhcp is enabled on the provided subnet, instead of checking
all the available ports on the subnet.

The body could then be ignored in the specific class managing the

proposal we might want to include in this change the modification of the
existing methods to add a new parameter (body=None) to avoid that they
raise the error ""got an unexpected keyword argument 'body'"" when they

OpenStack services may reference to previously defined variable in
configuration files using $ (dollar sign), e.g. 'metadata_host =
$my_ip'. Interpolation can be avoided by using $$.  Passwords often
contain metachars and $ is one of them.  We must replace all $
occurrences with $$, otherwise service will fail to start because it
cannot interpolate non-existing variable.

To launch an instance critical resources like availability of RAM,
vCPU's are required .
In absence of RAM or vCPU, an instance cannot be launched.
This makes a user to wait till the resources are available and
re-try once again.

To overcome this , we planned to add a new service namely as N-queue.
N-queue , which would be part of Nova, will keep user requests of
instance launch in a queue and will launch instances when the
resources are available.

ARP cache poisoning is not actually prevented by the firewall

Ethernet frame filtering rules, which prevent the sending of ARP
cache poisoning frames.

We used to allow creating from source/snap and specifying a
different type than the originating resource when doing so.
Once we started getting more drivers and more multi-backend
configurations, we implemented a check in volume.api that
took this away (broke it).  There have been a number of
arguments about whether this should be allowed or not, and
that it could fail after the rpc call leaving the user with
nothing more than a ""failed"" volume and no explanation as to
why.

This patch allows the capability, but checks validity at the
API layer before issuing the create call.  There are two
requirements for the new type specification to be valid:
1. There is only one backend (cinder-volume) topic configured
2. Both types in question specify the same volume_backend_name
If neither of these requirements are met, the user will receive
an ""invalid type"" error explaining that the type combination is
not compatible and that they should omit the type argument altogether.

Added support for updated_migrated_volume to common driver.
Added rename_volume to dell_storagecenter_api to support it.
Added tests to test_dellsc.py and test_dellapi.py.

The only thing we do in this rename the newly migrated volume
destination volume on the Dell Storage center to be the same
as the original volume ID.  Since we identify the volumes
by volume ID this prevents them from being lost.

This job is broken.  A patch merged into neutron which breaks this job
because this job isn't actually using the neutron patch it's testing
against:

    https://review.openstack.org/#q,8db41f04d54526104920f3a160203ecf7ef453b0,n,z

The revert of that patch won't merge because the lbaas-dsvm-api job is
installing neutron master.

    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/182413/1

This job should be non-voting until it's fixed to properly test the
right neutron patch(es) instead of neutron master.

This branch adds a new ViF driver to the Nova Hyper-V compute driver.
It's responsible for creating the OVS port and the related association
with the Hyper-V virtual switch port. Aside from the openvswitch binaries
it has no other dependencies. Flow rules are added by an external agent
such as OpenDaylight or by a Neutron OVS agent.

Previously, we would pass raw bytes to json.loads, causing a TypeError
under python 3. This would prevent getting server capabilities, listing
accounts, listing containers, cleaning up SLOs on overwrites, and
uploading with --skip-identical to an existing SLO.  Additionally, our
tests missed the error by improperly mocking the requests library.

Now, when calling json.loads, we'll either:
 * let the requests library detect and decode the body for us, by using
   Response.text, or
 * for SLO manifests, decode the response body ourselves. We do this
   because get_object *should* return a byte stream, and we know the
   server used UTF-8.

Further, the tests are cleaned up such that fake responses have bodies
that are always bytes and a text property that will decode those bytes
as UTF-8.
