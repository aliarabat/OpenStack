cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

This commit adds SR-IOV driver and new type of VIF to handle SR-IOV requests.
This driver can work as a primary driver and only one driver, but only when kubernetes
will fully support CNI specification.

Now this driver can work in couple with multi vif driver, e.g. NPWGMultiVIFDriver.
(see doc/source/installation/multi_vif_with_npwg_spec.rst)

Also this driver relies on kubernetes SRIOV device plugin.

This commit also adds 'default_physnet_subnets' setting, that should
include a mapping of physnets to neutron subnet IDs, it's necessary to
specify VIF's physnet (subnet id comes from annotation).

To get details how to create pods with sriov interfaces see
doc/source/installation/sriov.rst

simply pin the plugins repo to a released version. This was
done for Rocky in https://review.openstack.org/599811 but
it would not be appropriate to port that back.

The older version of pylint being used does not work correctly under
python 3. In order to be able to update the pylint job to run under
python 3, we need to update the tool.

This patch updates to the latest version at this time. It also updates
and pins astroid, which was previously capped. Using a pin instead of
a cap should let us avoid issues with new releases while being
specific about which version to actually use.

Disable not-callable because that appears to be a new rule that is
confused by the use of properties to access things that are set to
callables.

Reference bug #1600251, which describes a scenario in which
live migration of instances with an anti-affinity group policy
where by the migrated instance can be placed on a compute node
which as a pre exisiting member of the same group.

This test is designed to verify that the issue has been fixed.
It achieves this by adding an aggregate containing two compute
nodes and using a flavor with extra specs plus the schedduler
filter AggregateInstanceExtraSpecsFilter to place two instances
which are members of a group with an anti-affinity group policy
into the aggregate, one on each node.  Then a live migration of
the first instance is attempted and we verify that it fails.

In https://review.openstack.org/534819 we introduced the removal
of conflicting packages from the targeted host, but then we deleted
the list for RedHat in https://review.openstack.org/578844 because
yum kept removing and re-adding the same packages.

In https://review.openstack.org/603205 we solve the issue properly
given that yum is case-insensitive, and the root cause of the repeat
remove/install.

As such, in this patch, we restore the removal of conflicting
packages for RedHat in a different way. Each of the package removal
tasks are moved into the tasks specific to each package manager so
that each can be handled differently.

When passing a UUID to the client, use the Barbican endpoint from
the service catalog to fetch the entity. When passing an href, strip
everything before the UUID and use it the same as a passed UUID.

This allows for service usage when secrets are created with a public
endpoint but must be retrieved from an internal or admin endpoint,
and is probably how all usage should have worked to begin with.

Following on from PTG discussions, trying to write up the idea of a
simple two level hierarchy for project limits, based on the CERN use
case.

It would help replace the existing per user limits Nova has, and needs
to be reviewed against the current Cinder hierarchy to see if it
replaces their users needs.

The idea is to leave hierarchies deeper than two levels to be considered
in the future, for when the use case details are much clearer.

That process may generate stderr output (ovs 2.10 with dpdk support will
log about missing optional libraries for example), in which case the
agent will loop forever respawning the ovsdb-client processes.

AsyncProcess already handles processes exiting uncleanly, and logs
stderr output with log_output=True (which is the case for OvsdbMonitor).

As the monitors work on stdout output, disabling die_on_error is enough
to make them work with this behaviour.

In https://review.openstack.org/603056 we tried to remove conflicting
packages from the target host before installing packages from MariaDB,
but that didn't work because the package specified didn't exist. The
name used was an attempt to remove a specific version of the package
to avoid yum always removing and reinstalling the same packages.

Unfortunately yum is case-insensitive, and CentOS/EPEL/RDO have
mariadb-* packages, while the MariaDB repo has MariaDB-* packages.
These packages conflict.

To work around yum's case insensitivity, we have to query for any
installed packages using rpm (which is case-sensitive) and remove them.

We have to remove them without dependencies, otherwise for distro
package installation types on shared hosts it removes far too many
packages.

I'm proposing a revert of that test as it doesn't work with our
Python 3.6 containers based on Fedora 28 due to `ps` not being instaled
there.  I'm rather against installing `ps` into the container just to
make a hacky test happy. I'm definitely open to fixing this by
implementing it through reading from /proc, but I highly doubt it's
worth the effort.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

httplib2 makes use of the ssl module provided by Python; under Python 2,
the ssl module does not support IP addresses as subject alternate names
(SAN's) which although an optional part of the associated RFC, is awkward
to work with in environments where certificate management approaches
rely on use of IP addresses in SAN's.

The requests module is more than happy to deal with this scenario; switch
to requests in preference of httplib2 for metadata proxy calls.

httplib2 is retained as its used elsewhere in the codebase.

Problem description:
When trying to soft-delete an instance that is just resized but the resize
action is not yet confirmed, the soft-delete call will first attempt to
confirm_resize the instance, then an error will occur since confirm_resize
method does not expect a SOFT_DELETING task_state currently.
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/8e052c7/nova/compute/manager.py#L3911

Fix steps:
1 Add SOFT_DELETING to the expected_task_state of confirm_resize method.
2 Since confirm_resize method sets instance.task_state to None, set
  instance.task_state to back to SOFT_DELETING after confirm_resize is
  executed, so the rest workflow should finish as normal situations.

Having all services in one giant haproxy file makes altering
configuration for a service both painful and dangerous. Each service
should be configured with a simple set of variables and rendered with a
single unified template.

Available are two new templates:

* haproxy_single_service_listen.cfg.j2: close to the original style, but
only one service per file
* haproxy_single_service_split.cfg.j2: using the newer haproxy syntax
for separated frontend and backend

For now the default will be the single listen block, for ease of
transition.

We always run DB sync in deploy_tasks, ensuring that the database is
up to date. We should follow up with online data migrations
too.

Doing this via docker_config has 2 purposes:

* We can easily ensure this happens in a container with the right
  config files mounted.

* We can even apply this via a minor update. This is important because
  we'll have to backport this all the way to Pike and apply it there
  using Pike containers, before upgrading to Queens containers.

There's an additional issue to consider: In Puppet service variant we
ran the online migrations for release X before upgrading to X+1, but
the proposed Docker variant migrations for X run with upgrade to
X. This means that when switching from non-containerized to
containerized, we'll need to run migrations twice, to correctly switch
between the aforementioned approaches.

The Pike backport was edited:

* Nova upgrade_tasks taken from the Puppet variant of the service to
  match Pike upgrade framework (e.g. `tags` instead of `when`).

* Removed data migration for Cinder and Ironic from upgrade_tasks --
  those would run on Ocata still, but Cinder and Ironic have the
  online migrations since Pike. Containerized online migrations for
  Cinder and Ironic (to be executed on Pike) stay unchanged.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

not run the job on ocata changes since if the job definition
is dropped from neutron's ocata branch, I'm assuming sparks
will fly in zuul-bot-5000.

This definitely seems like a gap in zuulv3 and how we handle
jobs being defined on a per-branch level per-project and
yet affect lots of other projects that use them in the system.
The grenade job process and branch end of life stuff will have

The two do mostly the same thing, with _LibcWrapper having the one benefit
of lazy-loading the functions. But, libc should always be available; more
than that, it should always already be loaded.

Watching a simple program like

  lib = 'libc.so.6'
  print('loading')
  libc = ctypes.CDLL(lib, use_errno=True)
  print('loaded')
  libc.fallocate
  print('got func')

with strace, we see

  write(1, ""loading\n"", 8)                = 8
  write(1, ""loaded\n"", 7)                 = 7
  write(1, ""got func\n"", 9)               = 9

That is, there were no syscalls made when calling CDLL or getting the
function pointer. So, there's no real downside to loading lib C at import
time, nor getting a function handle. This is due to the fact that python
is already linked against libc:

  $ ldd `which python`
          linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff9b114000)
          libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f6471ab0000)
          libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f6471891000)
          libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f647168d000)
          libutil.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libutil.so.1 (0x00007f647148a000)
          libz.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0x00007f647126d000)
          libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007f6470ecf000)
          /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f647243c000)

Contrast this with liberasurecode where we see

  write(1, ""loading\n"", 8)                = 8
  openat(AT_FDCWD, ""/etc/ld.so.cache"", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3

(Though it's interesting to note that getting the function pointer is still
practically free.)

Combine the two methods of wrapping C functions and move it (and the wrapped
functions) out to a new common.libc_utils module because common.utils is
plenty long enough without that stuff. Keep the more python-friendly
functions (like fallocate, punch_hole, drop_buffer_cache, link_fd_to_path,
get_md5_socket, or modify_priority) in common.utils, though. While we're
at it, rework the API to avoid the need to catch AttributeErrors (which
IME are usually the product of stupid fingers producing typos).

The bare metal service returns errors in a non-standard format. To make it
worse, it also JSON-encodes errors twice due to weird interaction between
WSME and Pecan. This patch implements both the double-encoded and the future
correct format.

There is a case where `multipathd show status` should fail, yet it
doesn't exit with an error code. Instead it returns 0. Error is printed
to stdout as ""error receiving packet"".

This means that enforce will not work as expected.

The multipathd error got fixed here:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2015-March/msg00136.html

But that patch is missing in some packages, so this patch adds a
workaround to detect the error base on the stdout of the multipathd show
status command.

with vlan_id used on trunk port (e.g. ens3.10),
make this vlan device up and run dhclient on this interface
if it's not running yet.

This command was broken and that cause failure of this test.

Now that we're using the general templates, we can slim down
the role test definitions. We can also remove tests which are
not being watched, or which are fundamentally broken. With
this we can also remove unused scripts/plays.

We do the following:

1. We remove the 'ssl' job, given that the person working on
   that is no longer doing so, and no-one else has picked up
   the work.
2. We remove the 'upgrade' job, given that it's been broken

   regroup to figure out another way to do it.

When two management systems are available openstack/cinder and
SolidFire-API/GUI  a volume can be deleted though either interface. Thus
if a volume is deleted through the SolidFire-interface and then again
through the openstack/cinder interface it was possible to delete another
volume.

The original code made an incorrect assumption on all the possible values returned
from a query to find the target volume. This could lead to deleting a
volume that was not the target of the original delete command from openstack/cinder.

The correction in the module _get_sfvol_by_cinder_vref  validates that the
returned object/volumes-id matchs the requested volume-id with a
comparison of svol['volumeID'] to int(sf_vid)

The test_create_server_with_scheduler_hint_group[_anti]_affinity test
cases used a single server create REST request to boot two servers with
[anti-]affinity. There is antoher possible scenarion when the two
servers are booted with two separate API requests.

This patch duplicates these tests and use the multi request senario in
the duplicates. The multi request scenarios expected to fail unitl the
bug 1746863 is fixed.

Parallel booting of servers with server groups can be racy. However the
currently proposed multi request tests are doing the server boot in
sequence and the second boot only started after the first server reached
ACTIVE state. At this point the first server already assigned to its
host so we expect that this cannot race with the second boot request.

The anti-affinity cases also extended to try to boot a third server that
expected to fail as there is only two computes in the multinode
environement. Similar extension is considered for the affinity case but
seems unfeasible in tempest. That extension for the affinity tests would
need to make the compute host having servers from the affinity group
undesirable as a scheduling target but keep the other compute desirable
(except for the affinity filter). This cannot be made without disturbing
other parallel running tempest test as either:
* the test needs to disable that compute
* the test needs to fill the compute with instances
* the test needs to create a flavor that is too big for the affinity
  group's compute but still fit into the other compute

So the extended affinity case needs to be covered in nova functional
test.

This will allow us to take advantage of the Docker live restore
option, and not restart all containers during minor update on small
docker config changes. The containers will be restarted only in case
Docker RPM is updated during the minor update.

If we ship a config change which wouldn't work well with live restore,
we'll need to re-enable the restarts on config change. Docker
documentation does not specify which config options are safe to change
and which aren't.

We do this by simply overriding the ""rabbitmq_install_plugins"" to a

Project purge would delete the servers and volumes for the project the
user is currently authenticated for, regardless of the --project flag.

Note: This change means that no server at all will be deleted if the
logged in user doesn't have the get_all_tenants permission set in the
Nova policy (default: admin_api). This doesn't appear to be an issue
with Cinder as the default rule appears to be admin_or_owner.

this we can also remove unused scripts/plays.

1. We remove the 'ssl' job, given that the person working on
   that is no longer doing so, and no-one else has picked up

2. We remove the 'upgrade' job, given that it's been broken

In the integrated build, the repo build process upgrades
pip/setuptools/wheel in the venv to our preferred pinned
version, but the role tests using developer mode does not.

Gnocchi, since 4.3.0 [1] requires setuptools > 30.3.0 -
but CentOS only has 28.8.0 when it builds the venv, so the
package install fails.

In this patch we create the venv, then upgrade pip,
setuptools and wheel, then install the keystone packages.

Doing this for all roles is impractical, but it will be
necessary to unblock patches from merging into this role
today. In the future when we use the python_venv_build role
we can do all this there instead of repeating this patch
across all the roles.

As of the of the queens release cinder supports this config
option which, if enabled, stops cinder from query all
volumes in a pool every time it does a delete in order to
get accurate pool usage stats. The problem is that this
causes tons of non-fatal race conditions and slows down deletes
to the point where the rpc thread pool fills up blocking
further requests. Our charms do not configure pool by default
and we are not aware of anyone doing this in the field so
this patch enables this option by default.

The multi-logstash pipeline setup, while amazingly fast, was crashing
and causing index errors when under high load for a long period of time.
Because of the crashing behavior and the fact that the folks from
Elastic describe multi-pipeline queues to be ""beta"" at this time the
logstash pipelines have been converted back into a single pipeline.

The memory backed queue options are now limited by a ram disk (tmpfs)
which will ensure that a burst within the queue does not cause OOM
issues and ensures a highly performant deployment and limiting memory
usage at the same time. Memory backed queues will be enabled when the
underlying system is using ""rotational"" media as detected by ansible
facts. This will ensure a fast and consistent experience across all
deployment types.

Pipeline/ml/template/dashboard setup has been added to the beat
configurations which will ensure beats are properly configured even
when running in an isolated deployment and outside of normal operations
where beats are generally configured on the first data node.

- _build_regex_range is called 17 times on
  import of nova.api.validation.parameters_types.
  _build_regex_range internally calls re.escape
  and valid_char  on every char returned
  from _get_all_chars.
  _get_all_chars yields all chars up to 0xffff.
  As a result re.escape and valid_char are called
  1.1 million times when
  nova.api.validation.parameters_types is imported.

- This change add a memorize decorator and uses
  it to cache _build_regex_range

- This change does not cache valid_char,
  _is_printable or re.escape as hashing and
  caching them for each invocation would
  be far more costly both in time and memory
  than computing the result.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

That process may generate stderr output (ovs 2.10 with dpdk support will
log about missing optional libraries for example), in which case the
agent will loop forever respawning the ovsdb-client processes.

AsyncProcess already handles processes exiting uncleanly, and logs
stderr output with log_output=True (which is the case for OvsdbMonitor).

As the monitors work on stdout output, disabling die_on_error is enough
to make them work with this behaviour.

to direct the output to a file without using bash

--fail

galera_client vars file. We therefore rename the trove vars file
for SUSE. This also makes transitions between versions easier.

The mysql-python package is no longer maintained. We are using
pymysql instead, so this package does not need to be installed.
This resolves current build failures due to the mysql-python
package not being installable due to the new version of MariaDB
being used.

With this, we also switch django to use pymysql and ensure that
the appropriate distribution package is installed when doing
distro builds.

Right now, openSUSE and CentOS are missing ceph jobs because they
timeout. We can leverage the distribution installation method to
introduce new ceph jobs which are more likely to pass. However,
CentOS and Ubuntu are not working for this installation method so we
only add a job for openSUSE for the time being.
