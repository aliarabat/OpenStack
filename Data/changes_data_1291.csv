Currently, if a vSphere API call returns a fault it will raise a
VimFaultException with the name of the exception in
VimFaultException.fault_list. This is discouraging catching of
specific exceptions.

VimFaultException.fault_list implies that a single API call can return
multiple faults. However, this behaviour is not used anywhere in the
codebase, and it is not clear how multiple faults could ever be
returned, as the vSphere API does not work this way. This change
collapses fault_list to a single fault. If multiple faults ever were
returned they would all be logged as an error, but only the first
fault raised as an exception. However, this should not be possible.

The returned exception is a dynamically generated subclass of
VimFaultException, named after the actual vSphere fault. Classes are
retrieved by name with error_util.get_fault_class(<vsphere fault>).
e.g.

  error_util.get_fault_class('FileAlreadyExists')

The code also used VimFaultException for two types of fault which are
not directly returned by vSphere. These were FAULT_NOT_AUTHENTICATED,
and missing properties returned in a RetrieveResult. The change to
VimFaultException has required these to be refactored.
FAULT_NOT_AUTHENTICATED now becomes the existing API fault
'NotAuthenticated'. Missing properties now raise
error_utils.MissingPropertiesFault. The latter also extracts
considerably more information from the SOAP error, which is available
in the exception message.

Occasionally, SSH will get wedged so that a connection attempt is stuck
forever. When this happens, we need Tempest to abort the attempt and try
again. Currently, the individual connection timeout is set to the
overall timeout, so there will only ever be one attempt if this happens.
Using the channel_timeout instead will ensure that multiple connection
attempts are made even when the connection is wedged.

The test against keystone.notifications._send_notification was badly
broken, and the stubbed fake_notify method was masking this issue.

The operation and resource parameters to _send_notification() were
mistakenly reversed in the test case's call to that method, but because
the fake_notify() method was not looking for the parameters in the right
way, the test was failing.

This patch removes the unnecessary use of mox stubout and replaces with
a simple call to mock.patch() and a follow-up assertion that the mocked
notify() call was being passed expected arguments.

The root cause for the issue is that the Docker rest API does not
longer deliver the container list for v1.4 api calls.
The Docker API must be upgraded to 1.7.

Docker API 1.7 is a good choice since that is the first docker version
which officially supports rhel/centos.

In addition will docker client only parse json if the response needed
(to_json()) and this method will not catch json parse exception which makes
finding th eroot cause of a problem in the future easier.

We were seeing massive amounts on instance faults from failed automatic

While the route cause is a combination of using non-object instances
that were not populated with system metadata. With an object, the system
metadata would lazyload as required, but clearly not with a pure dict.

This fix ensures the non-object instance has system_metadata, so the
extraction of the flavor from the instance, during notifications sent

Commit I6448cb929e9afce814d0580eada91b8fd37befa3 added object support
to the rescue operations. This exposed a bug in the VMware driver

'<instance-uuid>-rescue'. In the past this name was updated on the
instance, now it is passed as a parameter to the spawn method.

Actually, the ""m1.tiny"" flavorid should be a string '1'. Considering
changing the id's tpye maybe cause confusion with the already saved old
data, add flavor_id to the flavor dictionary.

The instance_ref has all the flavor infomation, not need to get flavor
info from DB again.

The database connection string was not marked as secret, so it
would be printed out in cleartext in the logs when config settings
were logged.

The database connection string typically contains the password
that's used to connect to the database, so it should be marked as
secret so that it doesn't get logged.

After commit: beecd769af02ba5915be827d28a7b46d970e41b0
we're experiencing a race in the tempest gating tests.

It appears that there are certain cases where a detach
and a delete call can overlap causing a race in the
remove_iscsi_target method.  The result is that when
the slower method gets around to the final removal of
the persistence file it's no longer there, so we
hit an unhandled exception.

This patch does two things:
1. It adds the volume lock to the detach_volume
method in the manager (already in place for delete).
This should mitigate the race and allow us to avoid it.

2. In the iscsi_remove_target method check if the
persist file has already been removed when we get
to the last check.  The fact is that if it was somehow
removed before we got here we don't really care, we're
just going to delete it anyway.

Addresses: bug #1277041
Implements: blueprint centos-rhel-for-ops-database

By default mysql binds to 127.0.0.1. Setting the bind_ip attribute to
something else, as we do in the ops-database cookbook before calling the
mysql::server recipe, causes the my.cnf to be populated with the correct IP.

However, because of this bug in the upstream mysql cookbook:
https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-4161
mysql does not get restarted (it only gets reloaded)
and so the new bind_ip does not take effect.

This commit adds a workaround until the upstream bug is fixed. The
workaround directly modifies the template resource from the resource
collection to add a 'restart mysql' notification.

** This particular patchset builds on the last by adding support for
rhel/centos which use a different name for the my.cnf template resource **

All database API's currently include deleted images in the calc of
storage usage. This is not an issue when deleted images don't have
locations. However, there are cases where a deleted image has deleted
locations as well and that causes the current algorithm to count those
locations as if they were allocating space.

Besides this bug, it makes sense to not load deleted / killed /
pending_delete images from the database if we're actually not
considering them as valid images.

The patch also filters out deleted locations.

NOTE: In the case of locations, it was not possible to add a test for
the deleted locations because it requires some changes that are not
worth in this patch. In order to mark a location as deleted, it's
necessary to go through the API and use a PATCH operation. Since this is
a database test, it doesn't make much sense to add API calls to it.
Calling the image_destroy function with an empty location list will
remove all the locations which won't help testing that specific case.

I'll work on a better solution for that in a follow-up patch.

DocImpact:

    The patch now excludes deleted images from the count, this fixes a
    bug but changes the existing behaviour.

    The patch excludes images in pending_delete from the count, although
    the space hasn't be freed yet. This may cause the quota to be
    exceeded without raising an error until the image is finally deleted
    from the store.

When deleting a stack, it's possible for deleting the trust to fail,
for example if the user deleting the stack is not the user who created
it, or an admin (which raises a Forbidden error), or due to some
other transient error e.g connection to keystone interrupted.

Currently in this case, we fail to mark the stack deleted in the DB
and leave the status ""DELETE, COMPLETE"", which is misleading.

Currently updates to security group rules or membership
are handled by immediately triggering a call to refresh_firewall.
This call is quite expensive, and it is often executed with a
very high frequency.

With this patch, the notification handler simply adds devices for
which the firewall should be refreshed to a set, which will then
be processed in another routine. The latter is supposed to
be called in the main agent loop.

This patch for 'provider updates' simply sets a flag for refreshing
the firewall for all devices.

In order to avoid breaking other agents leveraging the security
group RPC mixin, the reactive behaviour is still available, and is
still the default way of handling security group updates.

Instead of storing the binding:vif_type and binding:capabilities port
attribute values in the DB, ML2 obtains them from the bound
MechanismDriver each time they are needed by calling a new
extend_bound_port() method.

This is a work-in-progress patch that generalizes the ML2 changes made
in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/21946/, which replaces
binding:capabilities with a new binding:vif_security attribute. A DB
migration needs to be added before this patch could be merged.

The approach to binding-specific port attribute handling proposed in
this patch was initially intended to allow MechanismDrivers to add any
needed parameters to the port. This would be used for
binding:vif_security, and also for additional attributes such as may
be needed for PCI-passthru support being developed. Please consider
the following questions in reviewing this patch:

1) Is the ability for MechanismDrivers to extend ports with arbitrary
attributes needed? Alternatively, a single dictionary attribute,
similar to the proposed binding:vif_securiy attribute, but with a more
general name such as binding:vif_details, may be all that's needed to
carry arbitrary information from the bound MechanismDriver to the VIF
driver.

2) Does this patch achieve the goal of allowing MechanismDrivers to
extend ports with arbitrary attributes? If all ports need to have the
same set of attributes, regardless of their binding state, then it
seems the plugin would need to know about these attributes and supply
default (i.e. None) values when ports are unbound or when the bound
MechanismDriver doesn't supply every attribute.

3) Is the overhead of calling into the bound MechanismDriver for all
operations including get_port and get_ports justified, or is ""caching""
the attribute values in the DB, as in the current code, more
efficient?

4) Are there any other reasons to prefer either this proposed approach
or the current approach?

The expected use case for floating_ip_bulk_destroy is to destroy
auto_assigned floating IPs, for which no quota is used so no quota
needs to be recovered.  But it can also be used to destroy other
(not auto_assigned) floating IPs, in which case the previously used
quota was not recovered.  This fixes the quota leak in that unusual
case.

Current patch allows us to retry db.api method call if
database connection was lost temporally.

It can be done in a such way:
 - We should use annotate all methods which are safe to retry with
   @safe_for_db_retry, if it's totally safe to retry these functions
 - And we must allow db-retry feature in config (`use_db_reconnect` option
   in a `database` group). It's will allow db-retry for all db.api
   methods.

If function suppose to be retried and it's got `db-gone-away` error,
it's will calls in a loop until it succeeds, or until maximum retries
count will be reached.
Maximum retries count and timeout between retries attempts are configurable.

We use SQLA engine.dialect.is_disconnect() function to determine
broken db connection so it's should work for all supported SQLA
backends (MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2 and SQLite supported as well).

Added wrapper for session and query methods. This wrapper catch
exceptions caused by broken db connection and re-raise it as
DBConnectionError exception.

Note, that it's safely to use db-retry feature only if all db.api
queries use single transaction.

At the moment this feature is experimental, so disabled by default.

introduced originally during the testr migration in an attempt to be
conservative about the possibility that locale settings in the

cause issues ought to be considered an actual bug. Also, having

problems with non-ASCII content in some package metadata files under

In RabbitMQ implementation, when using multiple rabbit_hosts, we don't want to
immediately retry failed connection for the same failed broker. This was not
the case in existing implementation though, where we've always attempted to
reconnect starting from the first broker in the list of candidates. So if the
first broker failed, we initiated reconnect to the same failed broker.

This change makes reconnect() implementation to select the next broker in the
list. This also means that non-failure reconnect attempts will also switch the
current broker. All in all, users should not rely on any particular order to
use brokers from the list, so this should not constitute an issue.

In Qpid implementation, when using multiple qpid_hosts, we don't want to
immediately retry failed connection for the same failed broker. This was not
the case in existing implementation though, where we've always attempted to
reconnect starting from the first broker in the list of candidates. So if the
first broker failed, we initiated reconnect to the same failed broker.

This change makes reconnect() implementation to select the next broker in the
list. This also means that non-failure reconnect attempts will also switch the
current broker. All in all, users should not rely on any particular order to
use brokers from the list, so this should not constitute an issue.

Currently it is not possible to modify the login method used with
kombu connections via configuration files, and requires modifying
the source code to actually add a login method in the first place.
This adds a configuration option (and default) which are passed
along to the kombu connection.

RabbitMQ allows three login method strings by default, but server
side plugins allow arbitrarily named strings to be used as login
methods and as such it is not possible to provide a fixed list of
options to the user.

The Python documentation states that ""the type of [the first argument of

string""[1]. Currently, in Python 3, a text string is given to
subprocess.communicate(), even though the process was created with
universal_newlines=False (the default value).

Rather than converting strings to bytes (and the other way around) everywhere
in the code, just create the process with universal_newlines=True. The side
effect is that '\n', '\r\n' and '\r' will be recognized as ending lines[2],
which should not be an issue.

The time of the last task run for a given periodic task was being
stored in a class attribute, which meant all instances of a class
shared the same last run time regardless of when they were
actually run.  This may not have been a problem in actual use of
the code because I believe in practice periodic task classes
are created only once, but it broke the unit tests because
subsequent runs of a task might behave differently depending on
whether a previous test had already run a task.

To me, this behavior is unintuitive and wrong so it should be
changed.

This commit also fixes the test cases to properly verify whether
the number of task runs expected actually happened.  The improper
call validation was the only reason these tests passed before.

Although this code error is part of the `ping_listener` tests, it was
missing from the list of known - and ignored - connection errors.

The code error 2013 refers to a connection lost during a query, see:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/error-messages-client.html#error_cr_server_lost

Without this error code, the session won't try to reconnect to mysql,

return a dictionary where the value is another dictionary with a `limit` key.

The `DbQuotaDriver` adhered to this spec, but the `NoopQuotaDriver` didn't.

SQLite doesn't provide a native implementation of BOOLEAN data type.
SQLAlchemy emulates BOOLEAN data type for SQLite using INT column +
CHECK constraint.
We have a few migrations changing the type of column 'deleted' from
BOOLEAN to INT. Due to limitations of ALTER in SQLite, in order to do
that, we omit the original 'deleted' column as well as the corresponding
CHECK constraint when recreating the table. Omitting of the constraint
is more tricky. It's implemented by analyzing the SQL text used for its
rendering. SQLAlchemy versions 0.8.3+ slightly changed the way
constraints are rendered, so we have to update our migrations changing
the type of 'deleted' column to work with SQLAlchemy 0.8.3+ on SQLite
backend (we aren't using SQLite in production, but we still need it for
running of unit tests).

Although this code error is part of the `ping_listener` tests, it was
missing from the list of known - and ignored - connection errors.

The code error 2013 refers to a connection lost during a query, see:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/error-messages-client.html#error_cr_server_lost

Without this error code, the session won't try to reconnect to mysql,
which makes `max_retries` useless.

Current nova test s3 server lacks HEAD for BucketHandler. And it becomes
an issue for Boto after version 2.25.0 [1], which changes underlying
implementation of get_bucket method from GET to HEAD request.

This change fixes this gap by adding HEAD response to test s3 server.
And also added cases for testing bucket existence per Boto document
suggestion[2], which applies for both Boto prior to or after version
2.25.0

Tests:
test_unknown_bucket in test_objectstore will make the get_bucket

 -secondly, accessing to Glance API server randomly according

Consider following event sequence, ""run_instance"" on host1 failed to
spin up an instance due to port allocation failure in neutron. The
request casted back to scheduler to pick next available host. It failed
again on host2 for the same reason of port allocation error. After
maximum 3 to retry, instance is set in ""ERROR"" state with a NoValidHost
exception.

And this ""NoValidHost"" error masked out all the error messages happens
on each of the 3 host, even those 3 failed attempts have already in
instance faults table. This is because:

* By design, nova show <instance_id> only present topmost instance
  fault, if any. It provides a snapshot view of instance fault instead
  of fault logs. So the previous instance fault logs are masked out.
* There's no API to retrieve instance fault logs by instance uuid.

Since instance fault table is going to be dprecated in future,
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/remove-instance-fault-table

This change is trying to mitigate the issue by saving exception
generated events to instance events table, before rescheduling to others
hosts. So that later to be retrived using ""nova instance-action
<instance_id> <req_id>"" command.

Defaults for configuration values can be specified in the Config Opts.
This patch specifies a default for workers in the Opt instead of
hardcoding a default deep in the code.

This also fixes the duplication for the default values of *_listen
and *_listen_port which were specified at both the Opt and while
reading the config using getattr. The right place as noted above is
the Opt configuration.

Another (good) effect this has is that trying to read non-existent
*_listen, *_listen_port and *_workers configuration will fail. Earlier,
tests in test_service.py were passing even when test_service_workers
was not specified.

This commit fixes the images clients for when tenant isolation is
disabled. The base image test class still had a reference to the old
auth style to get the tenant name if tenant isolation was disabled.
The recent auth_provider refactor didn't update this call so the test
would fail. This commit updates it to use the new credential dict to
get the tenant_name

Current nova test s3 server lacks HEAD for BucketHandler. And it becomes
an issue for Boto after version 2.25.0 [1], which changes underlying
implementation of get_bucket method from GET to HEAD request.

This change fixes this gap by adding HEAD response to test s3 server.
And also added cases for testing bucket existence per Boto document
suggestion[2], which applies for both Boto prior to or after version
2.25.0

Change in the latest version of boto is making a HEAD http request
to the server instead of GET to retrieve a bucket. We have not
added HEAD response in nova test s3 server and this patch addresses
the same.

Tests:
test_unknown_bucket in test_objectstore will make the get_bucket
call and http request used by boto will depend on the version. i.e.
    1. HEAD will be used by boto >= 2.25
    2. GET will be used by boto < 2.25

The solution to bug 1272500 (Unit tests failing with sqllite 3.8.2-1)
is to use a newer version of db.sqlalchemy from oslo-incubator.
This sync introduces a few incompatible changes that also had to
be fixed for the unit tests to pass:

-_extra_keys in Models must be a property
-Additional utcnow calls were added, which broke some unit tests
that were incorrectly mocking timeutils.utcnow.  timeutils
provides an override method that allows fake times to be returned
in unit tests.

run execution was added and cleaning_up. These tasks are now assynchoniously
called via NoseAdapter's methods. WSGI-controllers and models script
were modified to provide proper starting of tests execution.

Working code for kill action was added. Now when test runs are started in run
method of NoseAdapter task_registry dict stores binding between celery
task and test_run being executed by this task. This bindind
is used then in kill method for task termination and db data updating.

A common scenario in shared clouds will be that a cloud provider will
want to be able to offer larger customers the ability to interface to
their chosen identity provider. In the base case, this might well be
their own corporate LDAP/AD directory.  A cloud provider might also
want smaller customers to have their identity managed solely
within the OpenStack cloud, perhaps in a shared SQL database.

This patch allows domain specific backends for identity objects
(namely user and groups), which are specified by creation of a domain
configuration file for each domain that requires its own backend.

A side benefit of this change is that it clearly separates the
backends into those that are domain-aware and those that are not,
allowing, for example, the removal of domain validation from the
LDAP identity backend.

Implements bp multiple-ldap-servers

This patch allows admins of systems who use software that
generates/controls swift config files to add items to an existing swift
configuration that uses the conf.d-style without intruding on the
managing system.  This is done by adding a new config file in the
config.d directory with a filter section declared in it, and explicitly
declaring the ordering dependencies of that filter with other items in
the pipeline.

Other features:

Dynamic pipelines rendered under conf.d only
Added config.d documentation to proxy-server man page

In the libvirt driver, we log information about the instance we're
about to generate XML for, which includes a NetworkInfo model. In
reality, this is a NetworkInfoAsyncWrapper which acquires a lock
on the model. Since we're in the middle of a log statement, we also
hold the logging lock. This happens right after we've fired off an
async request to update information about the instance, which first
acquired the network model lock and then acquired the logging lock
to make a seemingly innocuous log record.

The resulting deadlock is fixed by this patch by stringifying the
NetworkInfo object before making the log call in the libvirt
driver.

Closes bug: 1275838

Although this code error is part of the `ping_listener` tests, it was
missing from the list of known - and ignored - connection errors.

The code error 2013 refers to a connection lost during a query, see:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/error-messages-client.html#error_cr_server_lost

Without this error code, the session won't try to reconnect to mysql,
which makes `max_retries` useless.

For objects that don't have a project_id attached to them, the
property can be set to None, which does not get overridden in
the policy engine where it being not set currently does.  This
adds a check for user_id and project_id being None and setting them
if they are.
