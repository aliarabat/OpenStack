This is a combination of 2 commits as per request from Ryan Moats.

=====

Optimize router delete execution

Optimize the execution of router delete in the L3 agent
by not performing operations in the router namespace that
will be removed as the last step of the workflow.
Comparing the slopes of the least squares fit of delete
execution time shows that this optimization decreases that
slope by over half.

=====

Refactor router delete processing

The discussion in [2] indicated that [1] would lead to orphaned
items during error cases.  This refactoring replaces the
optimistic approach followed by [1] with a separate delete code
path that does not execute the operations that take place within
the namespace that will be removed.  Operations that take place
outside of those namespaces are still performed to ensure that
no orphaned items result.

A comment has been added to the functional test to explain what
case is being tested.

Without this patch, users who enter long project names that fail the
jsonschema validation are faced with the message:

  Invalid input for field 'name'. The value is '<very long name>'.

which simply echoes back the input value and does not provide
information about what was wrong with the input. This is less than
helpful. This patch modifies the validator error message to, in
addition to supplying the name of the failed resource, also provide the
error message directly from the jsonschema exception. In apparently all
cases this message includes the value the user entered, so we can omit
echoing the value back. An example of the new message is:

 Invalid input for field 'name': u'<very long name>' is too long

An alternative to this patch would be to follow the pattern given by
the ""create_user"" action, where jsonschema does not validate the
maxLength and it is instead validated at the core level by a
keystone.common.clean function. This would solve bug 1557609 and give
us a more descriptive error message, but moves validation further down
the chain and contradicts bp api-validation.

The project column is enabled for admins by default, but can be enabled
via searchlight_policy.json for all users.  When it is enabled, it will
cause a lookup for the project name to be done based on the project id
of the resource in the results. However, the keystone get_project
api itself has a policy on it and any requests for a project name
will fail if the current user doesn't have access rights to it.
By default, non-admin users will get a forbidden result which causes
horizon to log the current user out (horizon bug).

This patch adds a policy check for 'identity', 'identity:get_project'
before attempting to look up the project name.

l3_agentschedulers_db module. This patch gets rid of it.

Currently we use OPM for testing stable branches, which isn't ideal because
we then can't test latest stable versions of the modules, e.g via use of
dependencies referenced in patch commit messages etc.

So, instead we always default to building modules from source, and add logic
to set the branches for modules where appropriate.  Note we can't do this via
a global reporef inside the puppet_modules element, because that element mixes
OpenStack and non-OpenStack modules, and the latter never have stable branches,
which we can't check without pulling every repo.

Also note that in CI the repos will already be pulled and set to the correct
commit, so we will respect the reporef's set by toci_instack in that case,
the logic to set branches here is really for developer convenience.

This reverts commit 2b2489966622939f17fe2250678abe9efac761eb.

The issue of not running on the right performance nodes was corrected
with I64cf074424b3c8eebf67510ba91bf24f2680dd0d.  I have done a number
of runs since then, all of which have landed on a RAX node

 [1] 50m 59s
 [2] 59m 02s
 [3] 1h 01m 44s

This low number is about what I would expect; it is about 5 minutes
more than other platforms running the same tests and is mostly taken
up by building pip wheels.

Note; we are considering a wheel builder for Fedora.  In terms of the
building, mirror and job setup, that's all quite straight forward.
The only problem might be with the infra puppet that sets up slave
nodes.  Fixing this for new releases is generally overall useful work;
it's not like the new stuff Fedora ships is going away (e.g. see
puppet4 efforts), but it can often be some effort to get this going.
This means we can not really rely on a pip mirror being up the same
day as we want to be testing devstack.

At issue is that Routes<2.3 allowed both

    submapper.connect(route_path).

In 2.3, you were required to provide both route_name and
route_path. This change adds a route_name to support both Routes < 2.3

If the maximum client version is higher than the maximum server version,
but the server version is otherwise valid, an UnsupportedVersion
exception is thrown. This bug fixes this issue by downgrading the
requested version, during API version discovery, from the maximum
client version to the maximum server version. The maximum server version
must be supported by the client. If all conditions are properly met the
client will continue to use the maximum server version for the remainder
of the request.

In order to log that the client version is being downgraded to match
the server version, when using the --debug flag, it was necessary to
update the logging configuration. Logging can now be used anywhere in
manilaclient as needed.

The heat-manage update_params encrypt script is meant to be used
as a tool for encrypting parameters in database entries for older
stacks. For encrypting the database, the service may be required
to be taken offline; thus the script should be as robust as
possible. In particular, if the db entry contains malformed data,
instead of crashing, the script will log the error and continue
processing of further entries.

helper from both the c-api and c-vol, we need to make sure that
the CONF.keystone_authtoken always gets imported. This is needed
to properly handle nested quota deletes which occur in the c-vol
service.

Before this fix, error handling code passed the view rather than the request object to exeptions.handle().
This resulted in an exception in the error handling code which made the actual error harder to identify.

Also added a check to see if the redirect goes to the same page which would result in an endless loop.

When nova-api calls nova-conductor a RPC MessagingTimeout might
occur. In such case we shouldn't leave VM in MIGRATING state. Possible
scenarios are:

* nova-conductor received message but failed to respond, no additional
exceptions raised - live migration will start, VM will be moved to
destination host
* nova-conductor received message but failed to respond, additional
exception raised (e.g., LibvirtError) - LM will not start
* nova-api couldn't reach nova-conductor - LM will not start

writes instance fault to database when MessagingTimeout is caught.

GlusterManager can be instantiated in two ways:

- with a component dict like
   {'user': 'johndoe',

    'volume':'vol',
    'path': 'dir'}

If the instance is created with an address string, it will be parsed
using regexp which facilitates the validation of the certain component
values.

Made changes such that if the GlusterManager is created using a
component dict, then change the format into the address string and allow
it to be parsed.

Mangling it through the parse ensures it meets the same criteria as
string addresses, without a partial reimplementation of parsing.

The repo_build process is slow and can do with some improvement.
To achieve better speed of execution some several slow tasks,
as profiled by the integrated gate have been moved into executable
scripts using jobs. These scripts are generated from the playbooks
and the Jinja2 variables created during the repo_build run time and
make it possible to perform multiple actions in parallel. In test
the results were significantly faster[0].

A new library was created to identify risky packages we're installing.
Risky packages are ones that do not exists within the global constraints
file and do not have an upper boundary. These packages have a high
likelyhood to cause breakage in future releases and being able to indentify
potential sources of pain will improve the repo_build process and our
deployment capabilities.

the other serivces by defining database_idle_timeout in the keystone

Routes v2.3 which just came out included a change (see the LP bug
referenced below) that caused py27 to fail.

At issue is that Routes<2.3 allowed both

    submapper.connect(route_path).

In 2.3, you were required to provide both route_name and
route_path. This change adds a route_name to support both Routes < 2.3

With the switch to rootwrap, the API service now runs as the gunicorn

the DIB element to ensure its writable by gunicorn for config rendering.

Also makes a trivial update to releasenotes to remove the UNRELEASED

At issue is that Routes<2.3 allowed both

    submapper.connect(route_path).

In 2.3, you were required to provide both route_name and

load balancer need to run the haproxy-install.yml playbook,

documented that running this seperate playbook is necessary, since
the haproxy configuration is listed as (optional) in the installation

configure haproxy_hosts in /etc/openstack_deploy, so this playbook
will be skipped anyways.

Through a series of attempts we haven't been able to sufficiently
solve the issue of what were called ""path_args"" in the past,
somewhat of a relic of the time before we had the Proxy layer.
""path_args"" made a lot of sense back when there was only the
Resource layer, when the SDK's usage was almost entirely through
the classmethods on Resource, back when command-line example
scripts were all we had to go on.

As things have grown in the year-plus since that time, we have
bolted a great higher-level interface on a lower-level interface
that was stuck in an older use-case. It was most recently a problem
when we had resource.prop types that accepeted Resource types,
which both there and elsewhere meant it became significantly harder -
if not impossible - to have nested Resources. An example of this is
how ServerInterface is a Resource that depends on Server.

This new approach strips Resource down to a public API of only create,
get, update, delete, head, find, and list methods. Resource subclasses
are still constructed in the same manner, though the naming of what
were ""props"" is now slightly different, but more clear. Additionally,
through that change comes a more clear user experience for URI
parameters, formerly known as, ""path_args"". The changes here pave the
way for more clarity on query parameters, although they haven't been
fully explored.

As the changing of this class has pretty far reaching effects, it will
exist temporarily in the ""resource2"" module. The first change will be
to introduce the module itself as a standalone, and then we will change
each service independent of the others. Subsequent changes should not
be too disruptive, mostly in the form of renaming things like
resource.prop to resource.Body, and the like.

There is a fairly major side effect of the implementation of this class
that is behaviorally different from the initial Resource
implementation. Previously, any-and-all data sent into a Resource
initializer would be tracked internally on the Resource instance and
then sent to the server *even if it did not correspond to a
resource.prop on the class*. Ultimately this would have become a
problem as servers are becoming more strict about what they receive,
but this implementation makes no allowance for so-called loose data
to be entered. If there is no component attribute for an argument
to be sent to the server, or one received from the server, it will
not exist as an attribute of the Resource. Currently, said data is
just dropped entirely, but it could be logged or perhaps a
strict/loose mode could be engaged to warn or otherwise fail when
unexpected data is entered. Ultimately, this behavior had to happen.
In the near term it may mean that the SDK doesn't work exactly as it
had in previous versions, but that will just mean updating Resource
definitions to match what is truly expected or given by the server.

A relatively major change that comes from this refactoring is a
deconstruction of the unit tests that previously existed.
While resource.prop now lives on as resource2._BaseComponent,
the unit tests were started over from scratch as they were too
tightly coupled to the Resource class rather than being tested as
an independent unit. All of the code that is being refactored
as a part of this change is now being tested as independent of
any other code as is possible.

Additional changes:

1. Removed support for aliases in _BaseComponent.

Aliased property names were added for samples coming out of the
telemetry service as they used to be supported and documented having
multiple names. However, they are no longer documented this way.

Additionally, aliases are abused in object_store due to a
misunderstanding which causes actual breakage during use. One
resource.prop was in some cases serving to retreieve both header
and body values with similar names. Ultimately, aliases for
property names are not needed and their support is removed
as we have separated out the storage of body and header components.

2. Query parameters are now more officially and easily supported through
the _query_mapping attribute on Resource2. The resource2.QueryParameters
class creates the appropriate mapping of client-side names to
server-side names, which is then used when calling Resource2.list in
order to transpose the names and make a proper request.

3. As all tests were rewritten from scratch, tests for the wait_for*
functions end up being 8-10 times faster as they mock out time.sleep
rather than actually waiting, thus making test runs a lot quicker.

This patch fixes an issue which was introduced by this
change If3edc1965c01a077eb61984a442e0d778d870d75.
Usually the vif config is of type LibvirtConfigGuestInterface,
but some vif use LibvirtConfigGuestHostdevPCI config
(e.g.  the ib_hostdev). The difference is that
LibvirtConfigGuestInterface keeps the pci address in source_dev
while LibvirtConfigGuestHostdevPCI has domain, bus, slot and
function, instead of relying on the vif config type we can take the
pci address for the neutron port.

This is a useful decorator for writing a simple function to filter or
translate exceptions based on criteria more complex than simply the
(super)class (i.e. in situations that aren't amenable to being handled
by simply matching subclasses with Python's exception handling syntax).
For example, this can be used to filter on the HTTP status code from a
generic client exception.

Unlike a naive implementation at the point of need or using contextlib
to create a reusable context manager, using this library class also
makes it easy to ensure that any exceptions that are re-raised (not
filtered) retain the same traceback.

One problem with tag names was found during tag
implementation in Nova Ibc44228aeae94c17353af7fccfcfb2c11b2e9190
This problems was connected with URLs. We can't
use '/' in names because in this case we will get a incorrect
URL for tag 'abc/cba': /servers/<server_id>/tags/abc/cba
Even if '/' will be encoded like %2F. Nova will decide
that it is '/'.

But this is not a problem of Nova. Unfortunately some servers
works incorrectly with encoded character '/'. It's a problem of poor
implementation of some servers. To escape problems with handling URLs
character '/' should be forbidden in tag names.

Some options in neutron.conf are used bu OVS agent, like logging &
messaging.
During the upgrade process, you need to restart the agent if these
options change.

We could patch puppet-neutron to add a notify, but the community won't
like it because Neutron OVS agent is not able to restart gracefully
until [1] got merged. Until that, we can fix it in TripleO, where we
suppose Puppet runs happenning during bootstraps and upgrades.

Later, we'll drop this code from here and move it in puppet-neutron.

New table ""L3HARouterNetworkBinding"" added to save which routers
are using HA network.

During router delete,
1)router entry from this new table is auto deleted.
2)tries to delete HA network from ""L3HARouterNetwork"", and will be
  succesful if no other routers are using this network in
  ""L3HARouterNetworkBinding"", otherwise fails.
3)tries to delete network from ""networks"" table, and will be
  succesful only if the network is not present in both ""L3HARouterNetwork""
  and ""L3HARouterNetworkBinding"" tables.

Similarly concurrent creation of HA network and entries in
L3HARouterNetwork and L3HARouterNetworkBinding tables by
multiple workers is also safe.

Need to take care of alembic migrations and UTs.

WebOb change https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/230 changed
the way in which the error response body is formatted such that
it's no longer a nested dict. So we have to handle both the
old convention of an error message key to the response body error
dict and the new way with just the error body dict.

This was reported upstream:

Nailgun integration tests use fake tasks, which run in threads.
This has been causing random failures. Although those failures could
of been fixed by different sorts of improvements, increasing timeouts,
etc. - this is still not an ideal solution.
Proposed patch removes use of threads in tests. All fake tasks code
which used to be running in threads only is ran synchronously for tests.
Threads are still used for fakeUI as before.

The steps in the proposal process were interleaved in a way
that made following them confusing. This change extracts the
definitions of terms from the actual process and simplifies the
process.

For the most part the spirit of the staged review process is
maintained but the steps required to reach out to the community
are clarified: Where there is consensus we involve just the CPLs.
Where there is not we reach out to the rest of community. I'm not
certain is the correct way to go. It's a compromise between keeping
things moving with minimal friction and including the broader
community as much as possible.

My hope is that this will help to clarify the term ""frozen"" and
when freezing is to be done.

This will probably require some iteration.

The header components now flow in accordance to the approved
UI. The search bar extneds to the entire remaining width of the
screen, and small adjustments have been made to the title
to offer more space in smaller form factors. It was necessary
to move the branding into header.html, in order to permit
proper column sizing (nesting them created weird padding issues).

Note that this UI doesn't work too well on a mobile screen -
that experience should probably receive its own treatment.

We need to reload/restart services on updates/upgrades to apply any
config changes, but restarting services managed from Pacemaker from
Puppet causes problems.

For now we no-op the restart and rely on the catch-all restart after
Puppet phase.

In the future we should have a service provider for pacemaker resources
that will be using pcs. We still might have to restart services outside
Puppet due to cluster-wide orchestration issues, but we might be able to
do the restarts selectively rather than restart everything.

We also no-op the start/stop commands to be safe, as it also doesn't
make sense for Puppet to try start and stop those services when it
doesn't have knowledge about Pacemaker.

Creating the heat keystone domain via puppet-heat makes use of
heat_config resources. See:
http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/puppet-heat/tree/manifests/keystone/domain.pp#n98

When doing this in step 5, this causes the openstack-heat-* services to
be restarted via systemctl. However, given that the services are already
managed by pacemaker, this can causes races with systemctl and pacemaker
competing to stop/start the service.

Some options in neutron.conf are used bu OVS agent, like logging &
messaging.
During the upgrade process, you need to restart the agent if these
options change.

We could patch puppet-neutron to add a notify, but the community won't
like it because Neutron OVS agent is not able to restart gracefully
until [1] got merged. Until that, we can fix it in TripleO, where we
suppose Puppet runs happenning during bootstraps and upgrades.

Later, we'll drop this code from here and move it in puppet-neutron.

The ceph job has been renamed to ""upgrades"", to continue testing
ceph support we need to add it to the nonha job. There is another
patch Ic0196596df6a11b02333d06f63b2e13c137c0bcc that is going to
be adding upgrades support to toci.

As is, this patch essentially will leave the upgrades job to a nonha
job without ceph.

won't work because some file operation needed by ceph are not allowed

Change I01b22593724616bc0a7793c509ecabf095d6927d made the
live_migrate() method in the ServerManager conditional on the
API version requested. This broke the host-evacuate-live
command which is calling ServerManager.live_migrate() directly
with one too many arguments for the v2.25 version of the method.

This updates the host-evacuate-live shell to behave like the
live-migration method and be aware of the API version when
calling the live_migrate() method.

A side-effect of separate ovsdb-server processors handling NB and SB
for default devstack (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/276364/) is
the use of ovn-ctl start_northd command to spawn the ovn-northd
process. The functionality of the devstack setup is correct, but in
the screen associated with the ovn-northd process, the output seen
is the following:

>> & echo $! >/opt/stack/status/stack/ovn-northd.pid; fg || \
     echo ""ovn-northd failed to start"" | \
     tee ""/opt/stack/status/stack/ovn-northd.failure""
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `&'
>>

The ovn-northd process is actually spawned correctly and can be seen
in the output of ps. The start_northd creates ovn-northd as a daemon
and as a result the screen associated with ovn-northd doesn't have
a handle to the process.

This patch starts the ovn-northd as a foreground process in the
devstack screen. It also provides some simple command line options
associated with start_northd command in the documentation for a
non-devstack use case.

An existing Neutron network can be specified as the network
being used for a Docker network being created. The Neutron
network id or name can be specified.

If a Docker network is deleted, the corresponding pre existing
Neutron network will not be deleted.

Usage:
 docker network create -d kuryr --ipam-driver=kuryr
     --subnet=10.10.0.0/24 --gateway=10.10.0.1
     -o neutron.net.uuid=d98d1259-03d1-4b45-9b86-b039cba1d90d mynet

     --subnet=10.10.0.0/24 --gateway=10.10.0.1
     -o neutron.net.name=my_neutron_net mynet

If subnet being specified does not exist, it will be created by
Kuryr. If exists it will be used.

The original tests expect the server console contains a message
  ""Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason""
but the expectation is wrong because this message is fallback one
when disabling crash dump, that means the test expects the crash
dump is disable. That is not the purpose of this NMI feature.

In addition, this message is output on x86 cpu architecture only
because the message is implemented in
  https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/kernel/nmi.c#L304
So if we use the other cpu architectures on the test, this test will
fail.

Let's remove the expectation from the tests.

This patch fixes an issue which was introduced by this
change If3edc1965c01a077eb61984a442e0d778d870d75.
Usually the vif config is of type LibvirtConfigGuestInterface,
but some vif use LibvirtConfigGuestHostdevPCI config
(e.g.  the ib_hostdev). The difference is that
LibvirtConfigGuestInterface keeps the pci address in source_dev
while LibvirtConfigGuestHostdevPCI has domain, bus, slot and
function, instead of relying on the vif config type we can take the
pci address for the neutron port.

Currently HA router interface port uses DEVICE_OWNER_ROUTER_INTF as
device owner(like normal router interface). So to check if a port is
a HA router interface port, we have to perform a DB operation.

Neutron server at many places may need check if a port is HA router
interface port and perform different set of operations, then it has
to access DB for this. Instead of that, if this information is
available as port's device owner, we can avoid DB access every time.

Additionally, the output is written by root, not the current user, so
use sudo when modifying/writing files in imagebuild/coreos/UPLOAD.

When reaper try to find the correct container_shard number,

return first entry's index of local devices from the ring

That causes some containers will be skip and objects under
