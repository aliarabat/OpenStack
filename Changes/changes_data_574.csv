Lets take as example this one [0].\n\nIn this file we do not use the dymanic inventory that we actually use in a real deployment but we use just a simple inventory which has groups and hosts. This means that if we do not add hosts in the groups the ansible will go to that group will see that there is no host included and will continue its journey.\n\nSo the reason I was not seeing the problem that you are seeing in Zuul is because the aforementioned inventory\'s hole. If you observe closely the logs you will see that in opendaylight\'s gate the neutron role runs only in server1 and server2 and that is happenning because the only actual group which has host inside it is the neutron_server group (check the file [0] line 36 ) the rest of the groups which are included to the neutron_all group are empty of the hosts.\n\nSo the functionality of my patch is to remove ovs from neutron_server which means that the config file which connects ovs with odl will never run for server1 and server2 and that is understandable because this is what my patch does removes ovs from neutron_server container. In the other hand your patch does not include my patch which means that your patch will run the ovs-odl conection ansible tasks because it will try to run them for server1 and server2. \n\nAlthough I think all the aforementioned is the a big hole to the gates in zuul the reason that you are seeing the error in opendaylight gate is because the [""neutron_server_container""] group [1] is not included in this file [0] which means that ansible finds a group which is not included in the inventory.\n\nIf you want to make your patch pass the gates you will need just to add the missing group to the inventory. \n\nBut I think that will be more proper to first fix the problem with the inventory because the tests right now are passing below the bar and that will be a problem for the whole instgration in general.\n\np.s.

It should be possible to use share type quotas in each project/tenant.
But we get error trying to set share types quota in second+ project
for the same share type. It happens so due to the bug in DB schema,
where we don't have 'project_id' in unique constraint.
So, add new DB migration that fixes unique constraint and cover it with

Previously deleting a network shows an unclear error message

  Error: Failed to delete network <network_name>

With this fix it will now show proper error message including
the error reason when neutron returns 409 (Conflict) response.

Sometimes it happens when Mistral rewrites the state of an
execution that has already been finished.

It happens because of possible race conditions in mistral when a task turns
the state and finishes the execution, but a scheduled call is not awere about
that and changes the state again.

To fix the bug we use WHERE clause during the execution update.

It would make life simpler for Nova and other consumers to know
if they're dealing with devices that utilize shared targets and
give them explicit information to enable things like device
(backend_id) locking.

This change adds two new columns to the Volume Table, shared_targets
and backend_id.

The shared_targets column is a boolean that indicates if the device
that hosts the volume utilizes shared_targets or not.  By default
we set this to True because it's safe to treat all volumes as shared
but not the other way around.

The backend_id column defaults to using the associated c-vol service
UUID.  This can be overridden via the config option ""backend_id"" for
cases where a cloud is deployed using a single backend device to
support multiple c-vol services (in the same cloud).

This change results in the following:
1. API Microversion bump (provides shared_targets and backend_id
   fields in the detailed volume view.
2. Object version bump to add respective fields to Volume Object
3. Addition of driver config option `backend_id`

Sometimes it happens when Mistral rewrites the state of an
execution that has already been finished.

It happens because of possible race conditions in mistral when a task turns
the state and finishes the execution, but a scheduled call is not awere about
that and changes the state again.

To fix the bug we use WHERE clause during the execution update.

To remove duplicated data this patch introduce common json fragments for
the instance related notifications and refactors the sample file of
instance.delete.start and instance.delete.end.

The common sample fragments define an active instance as that is the
most common state in the instance action notifications. This way
we can minimize the difference between the common sample and the
generated notification. Still there will be differences. For example
instance.delete.end notification will contain different instance status
and some other deletion related fields are also set. To make sure
the the sample matches with the generated notification we have to
override some of the fields coming from the common sample fragment.
Such overrides could be added in the test case directly to the
_verify_notification() call as it is done in case of dynamic values
like instance uuid. However the sample files not only used in the
functional tests but also during the generation of the notification
dev-ref. To have meaningful samples in the doc we have to do such
overrides during the reference resolving and not directly in the
test case.

The hide_server_addresses extension is looking up the cached
instance based on what the user provided for the server id,
which may not match what is used to cache the instance for the
request. For example, a request with upper-case server uuid
could be found in a mysql-backed system because mysql is
case insensitive by default, but the instance is keyed off the
server id from the DB, which is lower-case, so we'll fail
to look up the instance in the cache if the IDs don't match.

There is no test for this because it turns out it's actually
really hard to recreate this since it requires running with a
mysql backend to recreate the case insensitive check, which
isn't going to work with sqlite. Given how trivial this fix is,
creating a big mysql recreate test is not worth it.

This adds the description attribute to the Flavor object
and the accompanying database schema upgrade.

This is the first field on a flavor that we've allowed
to be updated, so it requires some new plumbing for doing
an update on the flavor record itself during save(). The
updateable fields are whitelisted so we don't leak other
updates in here, like name, flavorid, vcpus, etc.

As part of this change, we also have to be sure to not
persist the description in the embedded instance.flavor
since (1) it's a large field and (2) we are not going
to expose the instance.flavor.description out of the
servers API.

Versioned notifications will be handled in a later change.

The qemu compatibility mode preserves compatibility with the
previous generation of the qemu-img tools. In 2014, when Ubuntu
Trusty was introduced, it was set to compat=0.10 to provide
compatibility with servers installed with Ubuntu Precise as
both Trusty and Precise were supported at that time.

Precise is now End of Life since April 2017, so the compatibility
mode is being updated to the default mode that exists for Trusty
which is compat=1.1.  The mode has not been updated since then.

Updating the mode has the advantage of picking up support for
newer qemu features like more efficient copy-on-read behavior.
Setting it to an explicit value ensures that the mode is not
silently changed.

It should be possible to use share type quotas in each project/tenant.
But we get error trying to set share types quota in second+ project

The container create role will fail when adding a new network
to an existing set of container. The role attempts to read the hwaddr
file prior to its existence due to our use of local_facts. This change
simplifies how the mac addresses are generated by using a block / rescue
which will simply consume the known mac address from the container when
needed or fall back to the generation tasks as needed.

While working on this issue I noticed that we were still using a
pre-Ansible 2.0 failure notice which is no longer relevant as we've been
using Ansible 2.x for quite a while now. The old assertion has been
removed.

A new assertion has been added to notify the deployer that the
physical_host variable must be set to use this role.

Commit bf00e679016b60b421a9af353dd09dcaef514926 broke upgrades of existing

while the existing ironic-dbsync.log file is owned by root.

This change adds creating a file resource with the correct ACLs before

nova-manage cell_v2 create_cell just uses a dumb string comparison to detect
when a cell already exists. If there is a slight difference (e.g ordering of
params in the db uri query string) it can result in duplicate cells.

With this patch we should detect that the default cell already exists and
update it to use the current transport_url/database_connection instead of
attempting to create a new cell.

This patch adds env files for SRIOV, OVS-DPDK, L2GW, BGPVPN
and SFC deployments with ODL.

These files contain configs not present in basic ODL deployment
env file. While deploying, these need to be used along the basic
deployment env file like

and

and so forth for all other deployments.

The DatabaseConfigurationsTests.test_values_tab_discard_action
test is unstable, failing and succeeding on subsequent runs.

The root cause of the instability is the django local memory cache
used by the test cases. This cache has defaults that will cull
33% of the cache entries when it reaches its max capacity of 300.

During the test runs the cache becomes full and the culling will
randomly choose to cull the cached configuratoin being used by the
test case about 33% of the time. This leads to test case failure.

In a production environment the cache used is memcached which has
different behavior. If the cache entry were still culled, for the
""discard changes"" option, that would be equivalent to a discard
since the configuration manager would re-fetch.

In the test case flow it breaks because the 'changed values'
fetch gets a cache miss.

The fix is to set the cache configuration for the tests to use
a higher max_entries value and change the cull frequency to only
cull 5% of the entries every cull.

The previous attempt at this was to redirect as little as possible.
However, this has proven to be problematic twice. auth_cacert wasn't
redirected, it was used by some of the OpenStack actions and thus
blocked Mistral [1] patch that would have Mistral start using the new

This patch fixes a timing issue with cinder's db sync when
cinder-manage is containerized but cinder-volume is not.

Cinder services were containerized in [1], and this patch updates
the CI jobs so cinder-volume and cinder-backup with pacemaker are
also containerized.

Currently when providing existing direct port, nova-compute
will overwrite the binding-profile information with pci_vendor_info
and pci_slot. The binding-profile will be used to request
NIC capabilities for SR-IOV ports [1]. This also allows to distinguish
which neutron mechanism driver will bind the port [2].

This patch updates the behaviour that on update port it will update,
rather than overwrite, the binding-profile information with
pci_vendor_info and pci_slot. And on unbind port it will remove
only the pci_vendor_info and pci_slot from the port binding-profile
rather than unsetting the entire field.

nova-manage cell_v2 create_cell just uses a dumb string comparison to detect
when a cell already exists. If there is a slight difference (e.g ordering of
params in the db uri query string) it can result in duplicate cells.

With this patch we should detect that the default cell already exists and
update it to use the current transport_url/database_connection instead of
attempting to create a new cell.

The compute service list is polled until all expected hosts are reported or a
timeout occurs (600s).

Adds a cellv2_discovery flag to puppet services. Used to generate a list of
hosts that should have cellv2 host mappings.

Adds a canonical fqdn and that should match the fqdn reported by a host.

Adds the ability to upload a config script for docker config instead of using
complex bash on-liners.

The GET /servers/{server_id}/os-security-groups API code can
perform poorly if the instance has several security groups and
each security group has several rules. This is because when processing
the output, we loop over the groups, and loop over the rules per group,
and then for each rule, if it has a group_id specified, we query
the security group details (from Neutron in most cases).

If more than one rule points at the same group_id, we're doing a redundant
group lookup and sending more traffic to the security group API (aka Neutron)
than needed.

This change optimizes that single API to load the rule group details
up front so that we only do at most one lookup per group_id.

This could be extended to GET /os-security-groups but that API is
deprecated so any optimization there is lower priority.

A change was done in puppet-ironic:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/457478/

It broke TripleO upgrades because ironic-dbsync.log used to be owned by
root:root and now it's managed by ironic user in puppet-ironic, which is
good.

Because we want to support existing deployments, we need a way to handle
the new owership change, so let's do it in a upgrade task in
undercloud.py. Puppet will be able to run ironic-dbsync and we'll remove
this workaround after Pike release.

Newton backport note:
  Since the Newton version does not have ""upgrade"" flag passed to install,
  a try..except block was added to handle fresh installations, where
  the affected file does not exist.

The blacklist actions allow for adding and removing devices
to a unit-local list of devices to be skipped during osd
initialization. This list will be used to override the
application level, and thereby deployment wide, 'osd-devices'
configuration option on a individual unit basis.

The pre-existing list-disk action is extended to return
list of blacklisted devices under the 'blacklist' key.

https://review.openstack.org/500952 initially just did this. Then we assumed
every container should have the selinux sysfs.
This causes issues with the sshd container used for live-migration.

The advice from the selinux experts is that it should not be enabled within
containers, so reverting back to the original fix that enables it only in the
nova-libvirt container.

In other projects like nova and neutron, hard limit -1 often means
unlimited quota restraint. But Trove dose not support that. This patch
aims at two things:
1. Support -1, as unlimited quota restraint in check_quotas()
2. Add quota check to accept only -1, not -2 or other negative numbers
when updating quotas.

This patches fixes the get_boot_device methods for oneview drivers
to consider onetime boot option on the machine's iLO. If onetime
boot is set to 'Once' on iLO, the method will return persistent as
False (not persistent), True otherwise (persistent).

Also it\n    takes generally at least a couple of weeks for cores to get around to\n    reviewing code. The more you participate in the community the more\n    rewarding it is for you. You may also notice that the more you get to know\n    people and get to be known, the faster your patches will be reviewed and\n    eventually approved.

OneView has the time to expire an active session
defined through an idle time. This idle time is
24 hours by default. The previous client,
python-oneviewclient, used by the hardware type
OneView had a reauthentication mechanism that would
ensure the new session was created when the old
one expired. With the migration to python-hpOneView,
the mechanism to reauthenticate does not exist.

This solution creates a new instance of the client when
it is needed.

The previous attempt at this was to redirect as little as possible.
However, this has proven to be problematic twice. auth_cacert wasn't
redirected, it was used by some of the OpenStack actions and thus
blocked Mistral [1] patch that would have Mistral start using the new
context.

This change redirects all properties in the SecurityContext which should
be safer for our internal actions and for end users actions.

Commit cebfcf85f9034522a6521c40e1ae9c6d559f585f (""Use -t devpts for
/dev/pts mounts"") switched from using '--bind' to '-t devpts' for
mounting the /dev/pts virtual filesystem. However, mounting devpts to
another location also affects the host's /dev/pts mountpoint. Since we
are now mounting devpts without options we end up with the following one
on openSUSE

devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,mode=600,ptmxmode=000)

instead of the one we want

devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,gid=5,mode=620,ptmxmode=000)

The missing gid=5 options results to boot problems for virtual machines

So in order to fix that, we need to use the existing devpts options for
/dev/pts so we don't lose them in the new mount.

Some projects that use Kolla docker containers (TripleO) run
mistral-api under httpd. This patch adds the httpd package so that it
exists in the container and can optionally by used via Docker
entrypoints.

As many of these projects do not require the use of Apache (it is
opt-in) at this point not all deployment frameworks support the use of
it so the existing configuration defaults have been left as-is for now.

There was a race where the https apache2 site,
openstack_https_frontend.conf, would be rendered in one hook, then
subsequently the config-changed hook would run and enable that site.
However, the subsequent config-changed hook would see the template as
having not changed and therefore it would fail to restart apache2.
This lead to apache2 failing to listen on the correct ports.

This was due to CONFIGS.write_all() being called but a2ensite not
being called. This change fixes this race and adds a call to
configure_https() to ensure the configuration completes and apache2
is restarted.

flat network type is not mandatory. There are two cases,

1. ironic with flat network: we can use neutron vlan network to
   provision baremetal nodes, as long as the interface of the baremetal
   nodes are configured to use the same vlan.

2. ironic with neutron network: all provision and cleaning_network can
   be vlan type and no flat is needed at all.

So we should remove the task.

Mostly inspired by some comments left in the review of commit

in DevStack)

Sorted the list of enabled interfaces and the default interface

Used a local variable to store the uppercase value, in order to make
the code more readable as people may not immediately know what
${var^^} does in bash.

When using RHSM with a proxy, we want to make sure the proxy can be
reached. This patch verify that a tcp socket can be open from the client
to the proxy.

This patch also does a bit of refactoring:
- --retry-delay 10 --max-time 30 is now used in a parameter everytime we
  use curl.
- proxy options are now used everytime curl is used, even for detecting
  which version of Satellite is running, now we use proxy options.

TripleO started using j2 template versions of environment files, and in
the normal workflow the templates are all rendered before calling the

For example, we use this in our template for all Python projects as follows:\n\nif [ -f %teamcity.build.checkoutDir%/inspections/bandit.ini ]; then\n  bandit -r . -f teamcity --ini %teamcity.build.checkoutDir%/inspections/bandit.ini -c %teamcity.build.checkoutDir%/inspections/bandit.yml \nfi\n\nIn other words, you enable bandit on your code by adding inspections/bandit.{ini,yml} with the relevant parameters in your repository.

If the documentation simply lists that there is ""a TeamCity formatter"" a capable user should be able to find out using the other pieces of the documentation and the CLI help text how to enable that formatter.\n\nThe only thing that is TeamCity-specific is the formatter.

I see there are already some unit tests for the other formatters, so simply taking one of those and modifying the expected output would be a good start. The only thing that might be different in this formatter that requires some additional testing is the fact that every error code is printed as an inspection type only once, and only if it is referenced from another inspection later on. It should not be too difficult to validate that part with a separate test.\n\nChronologically speaking, my first goal would be to get Jenkins to stop failing on the code that is already there.

I mean, for the development/testing/preview a single instance could be good enough. But on the other hand, for production it would be better to have both flows separated and independent.""}, {'account_id': 14273, 'date': '2017-09-30 05:27:21.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 21:

The certificates may not be known to Trove when doing requests
to the different services so support insecure requests. This
can be configured via the new config options

- nova_api_insecure
- cinder_api_insecure
- neutron_api_insecure
- swift_api_insecure

All new config parameters default to 'False' so nothing changes
if not explicitly configured.

This is useful if the services use SSL adn Trove wants to talk to theses
services without configuring the different certs.

puppet run on never fails, even when it should, since we moved
to the ansible way of applying it. The reason is the current following code:

    - name: Run puppet host configuration for step {{step}}
      command: >-
        puppet apply

The above is missing the --detailed-exitcodes switch and so puppet will never
really error out on us and the deployment will keep on running all the
steps even though a previous puppet manifest might have failed. This
cause extra hard-to-debug failures.

Initially the issue was observed on the puppet host runs, but this
parameter is missing also from docker-puppet.py, so let's add it there
as well as it makes sense to return proper error codes whenever we call
puppet.

Besides this being a good idea in general, we actually *have* to do it
because puppet does not fail correctly without this option due to the
following puppet bug:

Currently, the default behavior of neutron when list security groups is:
if you are ""admin"", response everything we have in the env, and if the
user uses a security group from other project to boot a server, Nova will
show no error in API layer check but error raised in compute layer.

This patch added a check of security group project_id with the
context project uuid, and raises exception.SecurityGroupNotAllowedToUse
if they don't match.

All the router processing should happen only router processing queue handlers. Even if we going to add any periodic tasks, the task should add router to the queue and only queue handler should process them to force synchronisation.\n[2] Infinite retry [3]. Router processing(init/delete/update) is done inside this infinite retry. Though this is helping many times, if the errors are not correctable(because of defective router) this is completely bringing down the agent. When we have a customer deployment with hundreds of routers, finding the root cause for defective router failure is really hard and instead if limit the retry to a count(for example, retry 5 or 10 times) that can avoid bringing down the agent. And this retry really helps cleaning up the router resources(may not be all resources but maximum it can) rather than the approach we are following in these patches.\nWe need to address these two issues(I see none of the patches  trying to address ""infinite retry"" issue).\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/neutron/agent/l3/router_processing_queue.pyhttps://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/neutron/agent/l3/router_processing_queue.py\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/neutron/agent/l3/agent.py#L614\n[3] https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/neutron/agent/l3/agent.py#L529-L542'}, {'account_id': 1131, 'date': '2017-11-06 15:27:19.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 4:\n\n(1 comment)\n\nAnil - yes that is a good assessment.

As soon as we call router_info.initialize(), we could
possibly try and process a router.  If it is HA, and
we have not fully initialized the HA port or keepalived

Move the call to check_ha_state_for_router() into the

Also added a retry counter to the RouterUpdate object so

there is no need to do additional work if they are not.

This patch did't consider the minimal impact on code and I will update it. Besides, since the instancetask is grouped by ERROR(start at 0x00) and NONE-ERROR(start at 0x50), I update the UPDATEING task from 0x59 to 0x0c and move it to the behand of 0x0b, but this also break backwards compatibility, I am not sure if it is necessary.

You did what I asked but unfortunately I put my comments on the wrong items in patch set 1.

The DefaultStandardize object in pypowervm defaults the proc units
factor, max virtio slots, uncapped weight, spp, availability
priority, srr, and proc compat (note that the enable lpar metric
parameter isn't included in this stable/pike commit as the minimum
pypowervm requirement for Pike does not support that parameter).
nova-powervm does not pass in these parameters when resizing.

This results in these attributes being set to the default defined
by the DefaultStandardize object for every resize operation. This
change passes those parameters into the DefaultStandardize object.

Note that if the attributes were passed in as part of the flavor
then the flavor's values would be set later in the DefaultStandardize
object by the LPARBuilder.

When deploying with containerized overcloud and updating
containers prior to deploy, the DLRN hash of the images
used to install should match that of the containers' tags.

This review adds steps to get the DLRN hash and set the
images location, repos baseurl and containers tags.
It also updates the config/release files to
use the path to the DLRN hash related files.

Add new CinderRbdExtraPools Heat parameter, which specifies a list of
Ceph pools for use with RBD backends for Cinder. An extra Cinder RBD
backend driver is created for each pool in the list. This is in addition
to the standard RBD backend driver associated with the CinderRbdPoolName.
The new parameter is optional, and defaults to an empty list.

Adding this feature requires changes in two areas:
o The extra Cinder RBD backends get created via a new Puppet parameter
o The Ceph client key that permits access to specific Ceph pools is
  updated to allow client access to the extra RBD pools

This moves the legacy python-ironicclient CI jobs into the
python-ironicclient tree, instead of storing them in
openstack-infra/openstack-zuul-jobs.

This also changes the ironicclient-tempest-dsvm-src job to
inherit from legacy-ironic-dsvm-base instead of legacy-dsvm-base,
since the required projects are the same.

This will give us control as we migrate the legacy jobs to the
new ansible roles.

This is not correct,
because assertEqual(False, A) is a stricter check than assertFalse(A).
assertFalse(None) passes, but assertEqual(False, None) will fail.
Therefore, this patch weakened our tests.

When trying to exit health_manager the terminal
would hang due to a child process using time.sleep().
Now the process uses futurist.periodics to schedule
when to run which allows it to quickly and gracefully
exit.

Also handles the `failover_amphora` not working out or being
cancelled correctly and logging the statistics of those occurences
instead of incorrectly assuming everything always works out.
