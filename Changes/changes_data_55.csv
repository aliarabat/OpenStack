During e.g. rebuild of the server by Nova, ports plugged to such server
are quickly removed and added again into br-int. In such case, ports are
in the ""re_added"" ports set in the neutron-ovs-agent.
But it seems that in some cases it may happen that such port isn't
switched to be DOWN first and then, when neutron-ovs-agent treats port
as added/updated and reports to the server that port is UP, there is no
notification to nova-compute send (because port's status was UP and new
status is still UP in the Neutron DB).
As Nova waits for the notification from Neutron in such case server
could ends up in the ERROR state.

To avoid such issue, all ports which are treated as ""re_added"" by the
neutron-ovs-agent are now first switched to be DOWN on the server side.
That way, when those ports are treated as added/updated in the same
rpc_loop iteration, switching their status to UP will for sure trigger
notification to nova.

This patch adds a regression test which asserts that if a live migration
is aborted while it's 'queued', the instance's status is never reverted
back to ACTIVE, and instance remains in MIGRATING state.

There is simple idea behind implemented LiveMigrationQueuedAbortTest:
we start two instances on the same compute and try to migrate
them simultaneously when max_concurrent_live_migrations is set to 1
and nova.tests.fixtures.libvirt.Domain.migrateToURI3 is locked.
As a result, we get two live migrations stuck in 'migrating' and
'queued' states and we can issue API call to abort the second one.

Lock is removed and first instance is live migrated after second
instance's live migration is aborted.

Instance would be affected by problems described in bug #1949808
and bug #1960412 when queued live migration is aborted.

This change adds functional test to reproduce problems with
placement allocations (record for aborted live migration is not
removed when queued live migration is aborted) and with Neutron port
bindings (INACTIVE port binding records for destination host are not
removed when queued live migration is aborted).

It looks like there are no other modifications introduced by Nova
control plane which should be reverted when queued live migration is
aborted.

This patch also changes libvirt and neutron fixtures:

- libvirt fixture was changed to support live migrations of
  instances with regular ports: without this change
  _update_vif_xml() complains about lack of address element in VIF's
  XML.
- neutron fixture was changed to improve active port binding's
  tracking during live migration: without this change port's
  binding:host_id is not updated when activate_port_binding() is
  called. As a result, list_ports() function returns empty list
  when constants.BINDING_HOST_ID is used in search_opts, which is
  the case for setup_networks_on_host() called with teardown=True.

Use tox environment variable TOX_REQUIREMENTS_FILE instead of variable
tox_envlist to choose what gets installed in tox environments. This
saves redundant definitions in tox.ini. Release-specific tox
environments such as testenv:linters-* and testenv:ansible-* are
obsolete with the introduction of aforementioned pip requirements and
thus have been dropped.

Rationale for constraining Ansible releases using different pip
requirements files is that Ansible 2.9 or earlier cannot be upgraded to
Ansible 2.10 or 3.* (ansible-base 2.10) and Ansible 2.10/3.* cannot be
upgraded to Ansible 4.* (ansible-core 2.11) or later [1]. So to use
tox_install_siblings in Zuul jobs, the installed Ansible release must
(roughly) match the siblings release which is about to be installed.

Disable setuptools auto discovery

Jobs are broken due to a release of setuptools 61.0 introducing
non-backwards compatible breaking changes [1]

Setting py_modules to an empty string here will disable autodiscovery
and should permit jobs to run as before.

Currently, Sample Ansible Driver in Stable/Yoga supports only 1 flavour
in the config file. We intend to support multiple deployment flavour by
means of using this workaround.

This workaround uses the following filenaming policy to determine
flavor and the lifecycle point:

   config_<deployment_flavor_name>_<LCM_Point>.<yaml/yml>

   Example:
       config_default_start.yaml

The permanent solution would be to support 'primary' and 'dependencies'
definition under 'implementation' definition. It will be supported in
the future.

This reverts commit 7a7a223602ca5aa0aca8f65a6ab143f1d8f8ec1b.

That commit was added because - tl'dr - upon revert resize, Neutron
with the OVS backend and the iptables security group driver would send
us the network-vif-plugged event as soon as we updated the port
binding.

That behaviour has changed with commit 66c7f00e1d9. With that commit,
we started unplugging the vifs on the source compute host when doing a
resize. When reverting the resize, the vifs had to be re-plugged again,
regarldess of the networking backend in use. This renders commit
7a7a223602ca5aa0aca8f65a6ab143f1d8f8ec1b. pointless, and it can be
reverted.

Backport is clean from master, and the TODO that was present in the
commit message on master is removed, as its a driver interface change
and can only be done on master.

The web-download test expect an url in order to work, otherwise it fails

Tempestconf set the http_image to the same as image_path if http_image

The ping test starts at the beginning of the ""update run"" phase and
stops after it finishes. This means after all roles has been updated.

With this patch we stop, test and restart the ping in-between each
role update.

This means:

 1. that we detect error earlier;
 2. we detect error related to new flow being created during update
    run;

The point 2. was discovered to be an important test as ovn can have
existing flow still working, but new flow breaking. With this new
behavior for the ping test we catch such error.

The downside is that we have even more sensible to any % based testing
as the same number of error will give you an higher percentage as we
spend less time in the test for each run. This could be seen as
another improvement.

We're splitting the ping test into two stages so that if the ping
fails to start (as it would be for this particular issue) we would
detect it immediately instead of waiting for the end of the run.

When we doing batch update (all roles in parallel) we deactivate that
mechanism and fall back to the previous one as there is no in-between
role step there.

We also prevent the stop ping from searching into all home
subdirectory as I had an issue in local testing where one subdirectory
had unreadable files (after a local podman run). This shouldn't happen
in CI, but is good to have for local testing.

The Ceph RADOS Gateway uses some unusual URI's for multisite
replication; ensure that mod_proxy passes the 'raw' URI down
to the radosgw http endpoint so that client and server side
signatures continue to match.

This seems quite Ceph specific so the template is specialised
into the charm rather than updated in charm-helpers.

Nova notifier logs for external events only provide the event
details without showing its connection to the associated request_id.

That complicates debugging of corner cases for external events as we
cannot be sure to which exact request a logged event is related.

Make the matching request_ids logged alongside external event
details, whenever it is available.

When Memcached uses IPv6 network, the memcache_servers parameter should
be formatted as is described in the following example.
 inet6:[<host>]:<port>

This change ensures the proper format is applied even when hostnames
are used to define servers.

Also, this change fixes the timing to apply any2array. The function
should be applied before we check the first memcache server by [0],
otherwise the logic to detect IPv6 address does not work as intended.

The latest release of setuptools 61.0 made a breaking change[1] and
because of this change 'pip install' fails with the following error.

~~~

tripleo-ansible-inventory stopped working in Wallaby. However, TripleO
now stores the needed ansible-inventory on the undercloud filesystem.
This patch switches from dynamic generation of the Ansible inventory to
use of the already existing inventory file. Fortunately, the format of
the file remained the same as the generated one, so no other changes in
parsing are required.

Closes-Bug: #1966099

Each functional test method create new empty NB and SB DBs. Each DB
has its own table NB_Global or SB_Global respectively that contains
exactly one record created by ovn-northd. When functional test spawns
northd, it populates the DBs however it doesn't guarantee the running
test in parallel will not attempt to access the record.

This patch makes sure that northd creates the records before it moves on
and considers northd spawned.

This reverts commit bc004045cd30a708eadd64ded1af1b30ef1d1918.

There turned out to be some unresolvable issues with waiting for
events when lookup() is called from within a Command object in
the connection thread. Also the lookup of the notify_handler
was looking on the wrong object, so unless the notify_handler was
specifically passed (and we are not aware of any code that did),
this lookup timeout never actually was used.

Removing the feature, but leaving the arguments to avoid breaking
any code and adding a warning to update code if they are passed.

This reverts commit bd5599ca59b168ce4785991c4165fa4196b8d78a.

Reason for revert:
The issue was caused by old puppet version (<4.9) we used at that time
but currently we have already bumped puppet version to recent one(like
Puppet 7) so the issue should have been resolved.

Backport note: This patch has been updated to retain the existing
behaviour by default. A temporary variable,
rabbitmq_remove_ha_all_policy, has been added which may be set to true
in order to remove the ha-all policy. In order to support changing the
policy without upgrading, the the ha-all policy is removed on deploys,
in addition to upgrades.

When OpenStack is deployed with Kolla-Ansible, by default there
are no durable queues or exchanges created by the OpenStack
services in RabbitMQ. In Rabbit terminology, not being durable
is referred to as `transient`, and this means that the queue
is generally held in memory.

Whether OpenStack services create durable or transient queues is
traditionally controlled by the Oslo Notification config option:
`amqp_durable_queues`. In Kolla-Ansible, this remains set to
the default of `False` in all services. The only `durable`
objects are the `amq*` exchanges which are internal to RabbitMQ.

More recently, Oslo Notification has introduced support for
Quorum queues [7]. These are a successor to durable classic
queues, however it isn't yet clear if they are a good fit for
OpenStack in general [8].

For clustered RabbitMQ deployments, Kolla-Ansible configures all
queues as `replicated` [1]. Replication occurs over all nodes
in the cluster. RabbitMQ refers to this as 'mirroring of classic
queues'.

In summary, this means that a multi-node Kolla-Ansible deployment
will end up with a large number of transient, mirrored queues
and exchanges. However, the RabbitMQ documentation warns against
this, stating that 'For replicated queues, the only reasonable
option is to use durable queues: [2]`. This is discussed
further in the following bug report: [3].

Whilst we could try enabling the `amqp_durable_queues` option
for each service (this is suggested in [4]), there are
a number of complexities with this approach, not limited to:

1) RabbitMQ is planning to remove classic queue mirroring in
   favor of 'Quorum queues' in a forthcoming release [5].
2) Durable queues will be written to disk, which may cause
   performance problems at scale. Note that this includes
   Quorum queues which are always durable.
3) Potential for race conditions and other complexity
   discussed recently on the mailing list under:
   `[ops] [kolla] RabbitMQ High Availability`

The remaining option, proposed here, is to use classic
non-mirrored queues everywhere, and rely on services to recover
if the node hosting a queue or exchange they are using fails.
There is some discussion of this approach in [6]. The downside
of potential message loss needs to be weighed against the real
upsides of increasing the performance of RabbitMQ, and moving
to a configuration which is officially supported and hopefully
more stable. In the future, we can then consider promoting
specific queues to quorum queues, in cases where message loss
can result in failure states which are hard to recover from.

Backport note: This patch has been updated to retain the existing
behaviour by default. A temporary variable,
rabbitmq_remove_ha_all_policy, has been added which may be set to true
in order to remove the ha-all policy. In order to support changing the
policy without upgrading, the the ha-all policy is removed on deploys,
in addition to upgrades.

When OpenStack is deployed with Kolla-Ansible, by default there
are no durable queues or exchanges created by the OpenStack
services in RabbitMQ. In Rabbit terminology, not being durable
is referred to as `transient`, and this means that the queue
is generally held in memory.

Whether OpenStack services create durable or transient queues is
traditionally controlled by the Oslo Notification config option:
`amqp_durable_queues`. In Kolla-Ansible, this remains set to
the default of `False` in all services. The only `durable`
objects are the `amq*` exchanges which are internal to RabbitMQ.

More recently, Oslo Notification has introduced support for
Quorum queues [7]. These are a successor to durable classic
queues, however it isn't yet clear if they are a good fit for
OpenStack in general [8].

For clustered RabbitMQ deployments, Kolla-Ansible configures all
queues as `replicated` [1]. Replication occurs over all nodes
in the cluster. RabbitMQ refers to this as 'mirroring of classic
queues'.

In summary, this means that a multi-node Kolla-Ansible deployment
will end up with a large number of transient, mirrored queues
and exchanges. However, the RabbitMQ documentation warns against
this, stating that 'For replicated queues, the only reasonable
option is to use durable queues: [2]`. This is discussed
further in the following bug report: [3].

Whilst we could try enabling the `amqp_durable_queues` option
for each service (this is suggested in [4]), there are
a number of complexities with this approach, not limited to:

1) RabbitMQ is planning to remove classic queue mirroring in
   favor of 'Quorum queues' in a forthcoming release [5].
2) Durable queues will be written to disk, which may cause
   performance problems at scale. Note that this includes
   Quorum queues which are always durable.
3) Potential for race conditions and other complexity
   discussed recently on the mailing list under:
   `[ops] [kolla] RabbitMQ High Availability`

The remaining option, proposed here, is to use classic
non-mirrored queues everywhere, and rely on services to recover
if the node hosting a queue or exchange they are using fails.
There is some discussion of this approach in [6]. The downside
of potential message loss needs to be weighed against the real
upsides of increasing the performance of RabbitMQ, and moving
to a configuration which is officially supported and hopefully
more stable. In the future, we can then consider promoting
specific queues to quorum queues, in cases where message loss
can result in failure states which are hard to recover from.

This change fixes the wrong section used by manila::network::standalone
to define the network_plugin_ipvN_enabled parameters.
Previously this usage resulted in duplicate resource declaration, and
made this resource type unusable.

This change also replaces usage of undef by $::os_service_default.
These two are effectively same but $::os_service_default is now
globally used.

It can happen that we get the CNI request, but pod gets deleted before
kuryr-controller was able to create KuryrPort for it. If kuryr-daemon
only watches for KuryrPort events it will not be able to notice that
and will wait until the timeout, which in effect doesn't play well with
some K8s tests.

This commit adds a separate Service that will watch on Pod events and if
Pod gets deleted we'll make sure to put a sentinel value (None) into the
registry so that the thread waiting for the KuryrPort to appear there
will know that it has to stop and raise an error.

Recent versions of cri-o and containerd are passing K8S_POD_UID as a CNI
argument, alongside with K8S_POD_NAMESPACE and K8S_POD_NAME. As both
latter variables cannot be used to safely identify a pod in the API
(StatefulSet recreates pods with the same name), we were prone to race
conditions in the CNI code that we could only workaround. The end effect
was mostly IP conflict.

Now that the UID argument is passed, we're able to compare the UID from
the request with the one in the API to make sure we're wiring the
correct pod. This commit implements that by making sure to move the
check to the code actually waiting for the pod to appear in the
registry. In case of K8S_POD_UID missing from the CNI request, API call
to retrieve Pod is used as a fallback.

We also know that this check doesn't work for static pods, so CRD and
controller needed to be updated to include information if the pod is
static on the KuryrPort spec, so that we can skip the check for the
static pods without the need to fetch Pod from the API.

It's a common practice to have /tmp/ mounted separately with noexec
option. This effectively means no scripts can be executed from the
filesystem mounted to /tmp.

This patch explicitly calls sh binary to execute scripts from /tmp and
removes the executable flag from the scripts.

Follow up to Ib59c8bc2d8938eca18c943bb2e66ed185152a739, which stopped
downloads of the Cirros image in the seed jobs, but inadvertently
enabled DIB builds in the seed upgrade job. This is because
kolla-ansible sets create_image_via_dib to true in dib.yml, and that
file takes precedence over bifrost.yml.

This change fixes the issue by providing Bifrost overrides in CI using
dib.yml.

downloads of the Cirros image in the seed jobs, but inadvertently
enabled DIB builds in the seed upgrade job. This is because

This change fixes the issue by providing Bifrost overrides in CI using

Theses used to be used for building docs in the past and were made
obsolete with change Icc65afd5f6c0e22147b179c16d6a4fa5f47954ce.

A recent release of setuptools 61.0.0 introduced a breaking change [1]
which caused our openstack-tox-docs and openstack-tox-pep8 jobs to fail
with:

  error: Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout:
    ['specs', 'priorities'].

This removes setup.py and setup.cfg from use in tox.ini to resolve the
issue and they are not needed anyway.

It's a common practice to have /tmp/ mounted separately with noexec
option. This effectively means no scripts can be executed from the
filesystem mounted to /tmp.

This patch explicitly calls sh binary to execute scripts from /tmp and
removes the executable flag from the scripts.

Cruz,sombrafam,0,"Fix pre_live_migration rollback

During the pre live migration process, Nova performs most of the
tasks related to the creation and operation of the VM in the destination
host. That is done without interrupting any of the hardware in the source
host. If the pre_live_migration fails, those same operations should be
rolled back.

Currently nova is sharing the _rollback_live_migration for both
live and pre_live migration rollbacks, and that is causing the source
host to try to re-attach network interfaces on the source host where
they weren't actually de-attached.

This patch fixes that by adding a conditional to allow nova to do
different paths for migration and pre_live_migration rollbacks.

This change fixes the wrong section used by manila::network::standalone
to define the network_plugin_ipvN_enabled parameters.
Previously this usage resulted in duplicate resource declaration, and
made this resource type unusable.

This change also replaces usage of undef by $::os_service_default.
These two are effectively same but $::os_service_default is now
globally used.

In some cases it may be desirable to run libvirt daemon on the host. For
example, when mixing host and container OS distributions.

This change makes it possible to disable the nova_libvirt container, by
setting kolla_enable_nova_libvirt_container to false.

The stackhpc.libvirt-host role is used in order to install and configure
a libvirt daemon on compute hosts when
kolla_enable_nova_libvirt_container is false.

Create a Project section and move several previously
miscategorised reference pages to it.

Move the remaining previously miscategorised reference pages to
the software-contributions directory under the Community section.

Remove Reference section because there is no pertinent content
to put there. In the future, text leveraging the Charmhub to
cite software reference content will be added. This mostly
relates to charm actions and configuration options. The
metadata.yaml file may need to be manually explained due
to this data being missing from the Charmhub.

Add hierarchy to the Community section in terms of software
contributions and documentation contributions.

Rename a few pages (give them better names).

Adjust internal links accordingly.

Add redirects accordingly for older/established pages.

The contextfilter decorator was deprecated in jinja2 3.0.0, and has been
dropped in 3.1.0. This results in the following warning, and failed
attempts to use filters:

    [WARNING]: Skipping plugin (networks.py) as it seems to be invalid:
    module 'jinja2' has no attribute 'contextfilter'

This change switches to use the pass_context decorator. The minimum
version of Jinja2 is raised to 3 to ensure pass_context is present.

This backport also includes some changes to address issues with image
builds in CI, caused by CentOS Scream.

1. disable IPA image builds in seed deploy jobs

IPA image builds will be split out into a separate job. For now, disable
them.

2. copy a local file instead of downloading Cirros

This is a follow up to Ibc46a18d00c4c51b67ea18f24a4dd138ef59a4ff, which
did not work for the seed upgrade job when backported to xena. This is
because Wallaby did not support overriding dib.yml for bifrost.

This change works around the issue by copying a local file, instead of
downloading Cirros.

Users that don't set ``packages``, ``py_modules``, or ``configuration`` are
still likely to observe the auto-discovery behavior, which may halt the

To disable auto discovery, one can do below in setup.py

did not work for the seed upgrade job when backported to xena. This is
because Wallaby did not support overriding dib.yml for bifrost.

This change works around the issue by copying a local file, instead of
downloading Cirros.

In Rabbit terminology, not being durable\nis referred to as `transient`, and this means that the queue\nis generally held in memory.\n\nWhether OpenStack services create durable or transient queues is\ntraditionally controlled by the Oslo Notification config option:\n`amqp_durable_queues`. In Kolla-Ansible, this remains set to\nthe default of `False` in all services. The only `durable`\nobjects are the `amq*` exchanges which are internal to RabbitMQ.\n\nMore recently, Oslo Notification has introduced support for\nQuorum queues [7]. These are a successor to durable classic\nqueues, however it isn't yet clear if they are a good fit for\nOpenStack in general [8].\n\nFor clustered RabbitMQ deployments, Kolla-Ansible configures all\nqueues as `replicated` [1]. Replication occurs over all nodes\nin the cluster. RabbitMQ refers to this as 'mirroring of classic\nqueues'.\n\nIn summary, this means that a multi-node Kolla-Ansible deployment\nwill end up with a large number of transient, mirrored queues\nand exchanges.

Backport note: This patch has been updated to retain the existing
behaviour by default. A temporary variable,
rabbitmq_remove_ha_all_policy, has been added which may be set to true
in order to remove the ha-all policy. In order to support changing the
policy without upgrading, the the ha-all policy is removed on deploys,
in addition to upgrades.

When OpenStack is deployed with Kolla-Ansible, by default there
are no durable queues or exchanges created by the OpenStack
services in RabbitMQ. In Rabbit terminology, not being durable
is referred to as `transient`, and this means that the queue
is generally held in memory.

Whether OpenStack services create durable or transient queues is
traditionally controlled by the Oslo Notification config option:
`amqp_durable_queues`. In Kolla-Ansible, this remains set to
the default of `False` in all services. The only `durable`
objects are the `amq*` exchanges which are internal to RabbitMQ.

More recently, Oslo Notification has introduced support for
Quorum queues [7]. These are a successor to durable classic
queues, however it isn't yet clear if they are a good fit for
OpenStack in general [8].

For clustered RabbitMQ deployments, Kolla-Ansible configures all
queues as `replicated` [1]. Replication occurs over all nodes
in the cluster. RabbitMQ refers to this as 'mirroring of classic
queues'.

In summary, this means that a multi-node Kolla-Ansible deployment
will end up with a large number of transient, mirrored queues
and exchanges. However, the RabbitMQ documentation warns against
this, stating that 'For replicated queues, the only reasonable
option is to use durable queues: [2]`. This is discussed
further in the following bug report: [3].

Whilst we could try enabling the `amqp_durable_queues` option
for each service (this is suggested in [4]), there are
a number of complexities with this approach, not limited to:

1) RabbitMQ is planning to remove classic queue mirroring in
   favor of 'Quorum queues' in a forthcoming release [5].
2) Durable queues will be written to disk, which may cause
   performance problems at scale. Note that this includes
   Quorum queues which are always durable.
3) Potential for race conditions and other complexity
   discussed recently on the mailing list under:
   `[ops] [kolla] RabbitMQ High Availability`

The remaining option, proposed here, is to use classic
non-mirrored queues everywhere, and rely on services to recover
if the node hosting a queue or exchange they are using fails.
There is some discussion of this approach in [6]. The downside
of potential message loss needs to be weighed against the real
upsides of increasing the performance of RabbitMQ, and moving
to a configuration which is officially supported and hopefully
more stable. In the future, we can then consider promoting
specific queues to quorum queues, in cases where message loss
can result in failure states which are hard to recover from.

In change I11fb5d3ada7f27b39c183157ea73c8b72b4e672e, we started
delegating plugging of OVS ports to os-vif to work around a number of
bugs. However, this was only introduced for live migration. Plugging is
still handled by libvirt for spawn. This results in an odd situation,
whereby an interface of type 'bridge' will be use when creating the
instance initially, only for this to change to 'ethernet' on live
migration. Resolve this by *always* delegating plugging to os-vif. This
is achieved by consistently setting the 'delegate_create' attribute of
'nova.network.model.VIF' to 'True', which will later get transformed to
the 'create_port' attribute of the 'os_vif.objects.vif.VIFOpenVSwitch'
object(s) created in 'nova.network.os_vif_util._nova_to_osvif_vif_ovs'
and ultimately result in delegate port creation.

Note that we don't need to worry about making the setting of
'delegate_create' conditional on whether we're looking at an OVS port or
not: this will be handled by '_nova_to_osvif_vif_ovs'. We also don't
need to worry about unsetting this attribute before a live migration:
the 'delegate_create' attribute is always overridden as part of
'nova.objects.migrate_data.VIFMigrateData.get_dest_vif'.

Reason for revert: nova in Xena requires a newer version of
libvirt/clients than what comes with focal. Instead of building
custom nova images for X, let's wait for the next LTS which
is coming soon and then build X & Y releases off of that.

Use the coordination module to manage restarting the rabbitmq
services. This is to ensure that restarts are only
performed on one unit at a time. This helps prevent
situation which can cause the cluster to become split
brained (eg if two or more nodes are restarted at the same
time).

* Manually run _run_atstart & _run_atexit method when actions
  are run as this does not happen automatically and is needed by
  the coordination layer.
* Replace restart_on_change decorator with
  coordinated_restart_on_change. coordinated_restart_on_change
  includes logic for requesting restart locks from the coordination
  module.
* The coordination module works via the leader and cluster events so
  the hooks now include calls to check_coordinated_functions
  which will run any function that is waiting for a lock.
* Logic has been added to check for the situation where a hook is
  being run via the run_deferred_hooks actions. If this is the
  case then restarts are immediate as the action should only be run

Add the ability to replace an overcloud node that's running the etcd
service by updating the etcd cluster's membership to delete the old
node (the one being replaced) with the new replacement node.

etcd maintains its cluster membership using each node's name and it's
cluster peer address on the internal_api network. This data typically
changes when replacing an overcloud node. The cluster membership is
updated using a shell script that's triggered to run after etcd is
deployed on the new node.

A new EtcdInitialClusterState parameter is introduced. It defaults
to ""new,"" and only needs to be set to ""existing"" when the cluster
membership changes.

With setuptools release 61.0.0 sahara-image-elements' package build
command (python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel) started to fail:

error: Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout:
['roles', 'elements', 'playbooks'].

This bug is mentioned in setuptools issue 3197 [1], and the suggested
workaround is to disable auto-discovery by adding 'py_modules=[]' in
setup.py.

To unblock the gate the following needed to be updated as well:
- requirements constraints
- fix lower-constraints job constraints (only the 1st constraints is
  used by pip, which was upper-constraints.txt from install command)

With setuptools release 61.0.0 sahara-image-elements' package build
command (python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel) started to fail:

error: Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout:
['roles', 'elements', 'playbooks'].

This bug is mentioned in setuptools issue 3197 [1], and the suggested
workaround is to disable auto-discovery by adding 'py_modules=[]' in
setup.py.

To unblock the gate the following needed to be updated as well:
- requirements constraints
- fix lower-constraints job constraints (only the 1st constraints is
  used by pip, which was upper-constraints.txt from install command)
