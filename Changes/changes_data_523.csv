Tests for chunked backup drivers are using a randomly generated file to
test the compression, which means that in most cases due to the
randomization the generated file is bigger than the original one, so we
end up doing a non compressed backup, which defeats the purpose of the
tests.  More so when you want to test the decompression, since the
backup won't be compressed and there won't be any decompression.

To fix this we generate, for those cases, a simple file that can always
be effectively compressed.

Cinder doesn't propagate global request IDs internally, so any external
request that comes with it will have it logged at the API service and
then we'll lose this information in all the other services.

We are properly serializing this information on our RPC calls, but we
are not reconstructing the Context properly on the receiving end.

This patch ensures that the ""global_request_id"" field from the context
is properly added on RPC reception.

Our current mock_object method in TestCase does not behave as one would
expect, as keyword arguments will not work since the method is creating
the Mock object itself when one is not provided and the call to
mock.patch.object with provided keyword arguments will fail.

This forces the callers to create a mock.Mock object to pass the keyword
arguments.

This patch modifies mock_object method to properly accept keyword
arguments, resulting in:

- Consistent behavior with mock.patch.object and
  cinder.test.TestCase.pach methods.
- Increased readability for many cases in our tests since
    self.mock_object(os.path, 'exists', mock.Mock(return_value=False))
  becomes
    self.mock_object(os.path, 'exists', return_value=False)
- Reduction of lines of codes for existing and new tests.

While preserving behavior used in most of our tests, so all existing
method calls will still work except those passing new_attr argument as
keyword argument.

Volume attachment fails on StorageCenter API v3.1 because the backend

returns wWN, thus preventing the driver from finding the mapping.

if user passes 'volume_id' as null it will raise BadRequest(400)

will fail in this case. Also on master if user passes 'metadata' as
null then it is accepted. To maintain consistency we are allowing
'volume_id' and 'metadata' to be null in schema.

If we run two create encrypted volume from image serially (waiting for
one operation to complete before the making the next request) the first
operation succeeds while the second one will fail during the attach
phase.

The failure we see in the logs indicate that OS-Brick is unable to get
the WWN from the connected volume.

In reality the failure to attach the volume on the second operation is
caused by a failed cleanup of the first create, even if there's no error
in the logs.

The reason why OS-Brick didn't correctly do the cleanup of the first
volume is because didn't know that it was attaching an encrypted volume
and returned a real path (ie: /dev/sdf) that then go overwritten by the
unencrypted device mapper.

The solution is letting OS-Brick know that it's an encrypted volume
during the attachment phase so it will return a symlink to the real
device instead of the real device itself.

The manager's ""initialize_connection"" does this correctly, but the
method creating the volume from an image doesn't use the method of that
class and calls the driver's ""initialize_connection"" method instead,
which is missing the ""encrypted"" field.

This commit fixes the following volume image metadata
endpoints returning None following policy enforcement
failure:

  * ``os-set_image_metadata``
  * ``os-unset_image_metadata``

The endpoints will now correctly raise a 403 Forbidden
instead.

The kwarg `fatal=False` was dropped from
`context.authorize` for these APIs because the kwarg
is only useful when adding additional information to
the response body (if the user is authorized).

This commit:

  * makes the fix for the two endpoints above
  * adds unit tests for validating the new, correct
    behavior (as a side note, policy overriding
    in tests can be more easily accomplished via
    adoption of something like [0])

Also note that since the default policy rule
for these endpoints is ""admin_or_owner"" Tempest
doesn't validate this behavior by default.

unmanage assumes that you will be able to manage the

The built-in xml module has some vulnerabilities to several known
XML attacks. While the chances of this are limited with the way
it is being used by some of the volume drivers, it is still a
security risk that has been identified and has a mostly painless
way to be mitigated with the defusedxml package [1].

There are still some drivers performing XML parsing that are not
covered by this patch. They need closer analysis to see how to
best switch to the defusedxml equivalents.

This patch covers the instances where it was a mostly drop in and
replace from the native xml functionality to the defusedxml
alternatives.

The attachment_specs table is arguably not the best way to store

an online data migration routine to migrate existing attachment_specs
entries when a volume attachment object is loaded from the database.

Unmanaging encrypted volumes is problematic because
unmanage assumes that you will be able to manage the
volume again for later use, but, we have no mechanism
currently to keep track of the encryption key which
would be required for using an encrypted volume again.

While this may work out ok when using the conf_key
manager, this patch does not distinguish between conf_key
and barbican deployments.

The current implementation of ssh_utils never sends keepalive packets.
In ssh_utils.SSHPool, the socket timeout parameter is set to None
intending to keep ssh connections open.
However, when the parameter is set to None, ssh_utils does not run the
code to compare idle duration and keepalive interval.

This patch reverts the socket timeout parameter to default (0.1 sec).
The ssh_utils compares them every 0.1 seconds, and sends a keepalive
packet if idle duration > keepalive interval (= self.conn_timeout).

Unmanaging encrypted volumes is problematic because
unmanage assumes that you will be able to manage the
volume again for later use, but, we have no mechanism

This adds a bool column to volumes to notify consumers if
the backend hosting the volume utilizes shared_targets
or not.

We use the volume-drivers capabilities report to determine
this and default to True if a driver doesn't report anything.

The purpose of the column is to notify Nova that it needs to
do some sort of locking around connect/disconnect to be sure
other volumes on the same node aren't sharing the iscsi connection.

Using a default of ""True"" is safe because although locking and doing
the extra checks might be somewhat inefficient it works fine because
it will just appear that there's never any other volumes in use.

So this change adds the column to the DB as well as an online migration
to go through and update any existing volumes.  With this and the
service_uuid column consumers will have everything the need to:
1. determine if they need to lock
2. use the service_uuid as a unique lock name

That last remaining change in this set will be to add the fields to
the view-builder and bump the API version.

When creating a VMAX volume through cinder, a 'volume_identifier' is
set on the device on the backend. This takes the form 'OS-<cinderUUID>'.
There are a couple of issues with how this is currently being done:
1. When the VMAX driver retrieves the volume using the 'device_id' value
saved in the provider location, it checks that the volume identifier
matches OS-<cinderUUID>. However, the way this is currently being
checked can cause an issue if the create volume operation ends up being
retried in cinder - sometimes there can be two devices on the backend
with the same volume identifier, and the code may not pick up the
correct device.
2. On a deallocate operation, the volume identifier is not being unset
on the device. This patch rectifies these issues.

The Kaminario K2 driver uses the FQDN of the node that is doing the
attach as an unique identifier to map the volume.

The problem is that the FQDN is not always unique, there are
environments where the same FQDN can be found in different systems, and
in those cases if both try to attach volumes the second system will
fail.

One example of this happening would be on a QA environment where you are
creating VMs and they all have names like controller-0.localdomain and
compute-0.localdomain.

This patch adds a configuration option to the K2 driver called
`unique_fqdn_network` to support these kind of environments.

This patch is a minor reorg of existing code to facilitate subsequent
changes for migrating legacy keys to a modern key manager such as
Barbican.

volume/utils.py now supports these functions that manage the lifecycle
of an encryption key:
- create_encryption_key()
- delete_encryption_key()
- clone_encryption_key()

create_encryption_key() is an existing function, but it was not used
everywhere a key was created. All code that needs to create a key now
does so by calling this function.

delete_encryption_key() is primarily a small wrapper, but it will play
a larger role in a subsequent patches related to key migration. One
functional improvement in this patch is it no longer propagates an
exception when deleting an unknown key ID. This avoids needlessly
blocking attempts to delete an encrypted volume for fear that the key
could not be deleted.

clone_encryption_key() is a small wrapper that improves the transparency
of code that needs to create a new encryption key ID from an existing
key ID.

Fail requests to delete an encrypted volume when the associated
encryption key cannot be deleted. This avoids leaking an encryption
key when the volume is deleted but the key cannot be deleted.

This patch addresses situations where Barbican is the key manager,
and Barbican's security policy does not allow the user to delete
the key. Barbican has stricter rules on deleting secrets than Cinder
does on deleting volumes. For example, given two non-admin users X
and Y, Cinder allows user X to delete user Y's volume, but Barbican
does not allow user X to delete user Y's secrets.

If the encryption key cannot be deleted then the volume's status is
set to ""error_deleting"". To delete the volume, the volume's status
can be reset, and a user with suitable privileges (i.e. an admin or
the volume's owner) can reissue the delete request.

Since the switch to stestr, it appears any tests that output a large
amount of logging can cause subparser errors. One of the tests that
seems to occasionally trigger this is in test_exceptions where it
loads all classes from cinder/exception.py and asserts that attempting
to raise the class results in it being raised.

Many of the exceptions require message formatting values passed in.
The base CinderException handles this, but it also logs when this is
the case. So looping through all the exceptions results in a lot of
log messages for these missing format values.

Since all this does is assert that raising the exception raises the
exception, there is little value to this test. Arguably the only thing
it does is enforce that non-exception classes can't be added to
exception.py as those would raise a TypeError rather than the expected
exception, but that does not seem like something we should care about
enforcing. At least not in a unit test.

For some resources, due to their inheritance of the 'host' attribute
from the source where they are asked to create from, the 'CREATE'
request doesn't go through Cinder scheduler, thus missing the chance
to check if the storage backend still have capacity. Such resources
are snapshots, volume clones and potentially volume replication
clones. In some cases, current implementation is fine because those
new resource would end up being in 'error' state if backend is out
of capacity, but in the case where thin-provisioning is desired and
the backend has max over-subscription ratio set, this might cause
backend to serve more than it should if the backend doesn't enforce
simliar checks.

The solution in this change is simply passing all create requests to
scheduler even for those resource has known 'host'.

Alternative solution, which tries to add some scheduling logic into
volume manager is here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/437677
The fact that this change almost duplicates scheduler code in a very
unclean way makes it ugly, hard to maintain hence less preferrable.

Fail requests to delete an encrypted volume when the associated
encryption key cannot be deleted. This avoids leaking an encryption
key when the volume is deleted but the key cannot be deleted.

This patch addresses situations where Barbican is the key manager,
and Barbican's security policy does not allow the user to delete
the key. Barbican has stricter rules on deleting secrets than Cinder
does on deleting volumes. For example, given two non-admin users X
and Y, Cinder allows user X to delete user Y's volume, but Barbican
does not allow user X to delete user Y's secrets.

If the encryption key cannot be deleted then the volume's status is
set to ""error_deleting"". To delete the volume, the volume's status
can be reset, and a user with suitable privileges (i.e. an admin or
the volume's owner) can reissue the delete request.

The ONTAP drivers in Cinder (""7mode"" and ""cmode"") cannot
reliably and efficiently track provisioned_capacity_gb as expected
by the Cinder scheduler.

The driver authors originally assumed that provisioned_capacity_gb
is consumed space on the backend. This results in miscalculation of
over subscription in the Cinder scheduler.

The fix adopted here is to remove this wrong reporting and rely on
calculation of the provisioned_capacity_gb in the scheduler.

If you pass importutils.import_class a string that is not actually a
reference to a python class, you get an ""empty module"" error.
Cinder's keymgr.API call used to try to import the castellan backend
directly, but this was not necessary as the castellan key_manager.API
call will return the correct backend based on the api_class or backend
option in the config file. If no api_class or backend option is
specified, castellan key_manager API call will return a barbican backend
by default [1].

Castellan used to require the full class name to specify the backend (i.e.
api_class=castellan.key_manager.barbican_key_manager.BarbicanKeyManager),
so the import_class call in cinder was no issue. Recently castellan
was updated to use stevedore entry points and the config option name was changed
to ""backend"" [2]. The change in castellan is backwards compatible so that if
you use a full module name instead of the stevedore entry point name, it will
still get the correct backend. However, the cinder code was not updated accordingly,
so any time the shorthand stevedore entry point name for the backend is used
instead of the full module name, the import_class call in cinder will fail.

This change removes the unnecessary import_class call and adds an appropriate
unit test that shows the ""empty module"" error does not occur anymore.

Support for volume encryption of FS-based volumes is not
currently implemented in Nova.  Creating encrypted volumes
with these drivers can result in dangerous and undesired
behavior.  Block creation of encrypted volumes for these
drivers until this is supported.

This adds a per-driver switch which can be used to enable
this for individual RemoteFS drivers as they are tested.

There a number of use cases where it's desirable to do things with volumes
out of band (ie not under Cinders control). One example is external backups
without the use of c-backup.

It's pretty simple to signify these sorts of things from Cinder through
the use of extra-specs keys. For example, create a type 'daily-backup'
with extra-specs 'SFAttribute:backup=daily' which may instruct some automation
to query the SolidFire device for any volumes with the attribute
""backup=daily"" to be backed up on a daily schedule.

These attributes are just metadata and can be used for anything.
They don't effect Cinder's operation or change anything in how the volume behaves
from Cinders perspective, but instead add additional information and signals for
admins and automation outside of OpenStack/Cinder.

The only requirement is the use of a key delimiter, in this case `SFAttribute`
which instructs the scheduler to ignore the associated key for scheduling, and also
is used as a sentinal for the SF driver to determine what to store in attributes.

Detaching a volume in VMAX removes the volume from all its current

desired behaviour when the volume is a member of a generic volume group.
The volume should only be removed from the storage group associated

While adding a volume to ConsistencyGroup the failed with TypeError: sequence
item 0: expected string, tuple found.  This could have happened if the driver
did not find the specified LSS pairs matching that of the available volume
pools.  The driver intended to throw an error message with available_lss_pairs
but failed to concatinate the data to the error message with TypeError
exception.

The proposed fix attempts to address this issue by simplifying the
concat of available_lss_pairs as string and then adding to error message.

Current Kaminario K2 driver only supports iSCSI multipathing using
discovery (sendtargets), which in some cases may be undesirable, since a
broken primary path could prevent an attachment.

This code adds the possibility of not using discovery mode and return
all connection information when `initialize_connection` is called, which
should provide increased reliability.

Current RBD code is incorrectly reporting the stats of the pool in the
following ways:

- `provisioned_capacity_gb` contains physical space used by cinder created
  volumes.
- `free_capacity_gb` is not taking into account that pools can have quota
  restrictions and they should be used as the reference for the free capacity.
- `total_capacity` dynamically changes, which means that there is no way to
  have a fixed over provisioning capacity.

This patch fixes the stats reporting making sure we return the right
values in `provisioned_capacity_gb` and `free_capacity_gb`, and allows
us to use a static calculation of the `total_capacity` using
`report_dynamic_total_capacity` configuration option.

We don't report `allocated_capacity_gb` because this is something that
is calculated by the Cinder core code and should not be reported by
drivers, even if it's not currently working as expected [1][2].

The ONTAP drivers in Cinder (""7mode"" and ""cmode"") cannot
reliably and efficiently track provisioned_capacity_gb as expected
by the Cinder scheduler.

The driver authors originally assumed that provisioned_capacity_gb
is consumed space on the backend. This results in miscalculation of
over subscription in the Cinder scheduler.

The fix adopted here is to remove this wrong reporting and rely on
calculation of the provisioned_capacity_gb in the scheduler.

Our services ID column is still just an integer and that's *ok* for the

more meaningful and unique identifier to the users of services though.

This change adds an indexable UUID column to the services, this will
be useful for things like identifying backends without leaking

it looks that it can be up to 25.

For the stats reporting we have a decoupled implementation where the
gathering of stats from the backend and the submission of these stats to
the schedulers are run in independent periodic tasks.

The problem with this implementation is that we'll be getting old stats
all the time because of the threading model we are using.

Since we have greenthreads we will not switch threads until we do I/O,
so if the _publish_service_capabilities periodic task is invoked first
we won't switch to the _report_driver_status until we send the
capabilities update.  And even if we start the _report_driver_status
task first as soon as it does some I/O to query the backend we'll be
switching to sending the cached data to the schedulers.

It may not sound like a big problem, but when you are quickly creating a
great number of big volumes having an additional minute old data can be
problematic.

This patch changes the way we do the status reporting and ensures that
we are always sending the newest data.

There could only be 1 drawback to this change, and that is if a driver
takes longer than 1 minute to gather the stats, because in this case a
newly started scheduler will take a little longer to have stats for this
backend.  But it doesn't really happen, because the schedulers actually
request the volumes for their capabilities on start up.

Rally <0.10.0 was hardcoded to support only OpenStack platform. That is
why deployment config had a flat schema (i.e openstack credentials were
at the same top-level as other properties).

Rally 0.10 includes an attempt to unify deployment component for
supporting multiple platforms. The deployment config was extended with a
new top level property `creds` which was designed to include credentials
for different platforms.
Since Task and Verification components used deployment.credentials object
from database instead of using deployment config directly, Rally 0.10 did
not provide a database migration of deployment config.

While developing Rally 0.11.0 with new Environment component, we made a
wrong assumption and forgot about an old format. That is why a
7287df262dbc migration relied on ""creds"" property of deployment.config

If the database was created before Rally<0.10, the introduced assumption
leds to KeyError failure[0] for old deployment configuration:

  File "".../7287df262dbc_move_deployment_to_env.py"", line 137, in upgrade
       and (set(spec[""creds""]) == {""openstack""}
  KeyError: 'creds'

To fix this issue, we need to disable 7287df262dbc migration, introduce
a new migration for an old deployment format, return the code of
7287df262dbc in a new migration.

NOTE: This commit introduces several migrations at once. These
   migrations have downgrade methods which are not tested(we do not support
   downgrade, but these methods are mandatory). To make CI happy with these
   uncovered by unit tests lines we need to temporary increase the magic
   number in coverage job.

On startup, when we initialize the IDL we start receiving notifications
right away and processing them. There's a possibility that even though
the IDLs are initialized, post_fork_initialize has not yet created the
ovn_client object resulting in an exception (and also possible missing
DB updates) if attempted to be used.

This patch fixes this by converting ovn_client object in mech driver
into a property which initializes it if doesn't exist yet.

The ability to lock the pip configuration down has
now been extended so that it is possible to implement
a different index and to use find-links to achieve the
same goal.

The only replacement implementation could be to disable
the setting of an index if one wanted to *only* use
wheels, but that is unnecessary in OSA builds as we are
able to set the build to only use a specific set of
wheels through the pypiserver on the repo container.

As such, this variable has become useless and unused.
This patch therefore removes it.

In I2c50bb693dc5dc505bddce34ff45294ac44f7dc9 we applied changes
to the settings to repo_build_venv_command_options so that pip,
setuptools and wheel were not copied into the new virtualend on
creation, but rather installed into it later.

Unfortunately the patch missed that CentOS and SuSE platforms
have an override for the same variable, so the issue set out in
the patch still applies to those platforms.

This patch ensures that the overrides are removed and the
variable is only declared in one place, but the same functionality
which gave rise to the override for those platforms is still

This is a backport of:
- https://review.openstack.org/543588
- https://review.openstack.org/545503

The log directory for neutron has the default_t SELinux context and this
prevents rsyslog from accessing neutron's logs. This patch ensures that
the file contexts are set properly for neutron's logs.

This change also makes neutron's log directory configurable using the
`neutron_log_dir` variable.

one key at a time. But the implementation of the assertion actually
assumes it is given a list of string values. This commit fixes the
name of the assertion to be more clear and it also makes the
assertion iterate all values given, which ensures each key in the
list is valid, not just the first one.

By looking at the api-ref of other openstack projects, they don't
list the query parameters in the URL. Actually, the type of each
request's parameter has already been documented in the table so
it is necessary to list them in URL as well. Doing that will
make the API doc looks verbose.

The call to _update_resource_tracker from
_allocate_network is a carryover from old
times when _allocate_network would call
_instance_update which would update the
resource tracker generically for any state
change in an instance.

_update_resource_tracker calls rt.update_usage
which grabs the COMPUTE_RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE lock
which is the same lock used during claims and when
the update_available_resource periodic task runs.

The update_usage method can be a bit heavy weight
if you're not actually changing anything the
resource tracker cares about, because it's re-calculating
stats for the capabilities scheduler filter and it's
collecting new inventory from the virt driver and
potentially updating that inventory for the compute
node in placement.

So given all _allocate_network is doing is changing
the state on the instance, and the state it's changing
to has nothing to do with what the resource tracker
cares about (like deleting or shelve offloading an instance),
we shouldn't call rt.update_usage and hold that big
lock unnecessarily since it could hold up other
operations happening at the same time, like creating
instances.

epoch to signal a transition to sharding, and we shouldn't be

therefore be ok for a root container to be deleted, revived

This is a partial backport of [1] without the octavia
specific changes, and [2] combined with it.

Currently the pip_install role does not configure any
constraints when exercising the AIO bootstrap, creating
the possibility that the initial bootstrap may not have
the right software versions.

This patch ensures that the same constraints are used
for the AIO bootstrap as was done for the Ansible
bootstrap.

Tests assumed API v2 for most things, even though the current
supported API is v3 and all future work will go under that as
microversions.

This switches v3 to be the default enabled version and extends
tests to cover both v2 and v3 base functionality.

v3.0 is identical to v2. Since there is some concern about that
being true, and to plan ahead for the eventual removal of v2 at
some point in the future, all v2 tests just inherit from the v3
ones with only changes to the api_version.

To further support that these base APIs are the same, the v3
clients extend from the v2 clients and just extend them with
new functionality. This mismatch between conventions with the
clients and the tests are intentional.

The Cinder v2 API is deprecated and everything should now be moving to
the v3 API with support for microversions. The base v3 is identical to
v2.

This is a first patch in a series to move over to using v3 by default.
It adds the clients necessary for using the v3 API for all existing tests
and updates some client usage where a specific version was not necessary
to just use whatever the latest supported version is available.

Since the base v3 is the same as v2, these clients just inherit from the
v2 clients for now and override the api version value.

In https://review.openstack.org/535252 the installation
process for the role was simplified, but an unintentional
side-effect was to removed the previously included support
for installing the extra percona packages when installing
on the ppc64le platform.

This patch re-introduces that ability, but scopes it to
only execute on that hardware platform, and only for Ubuntu.

The download is, by default, facilitated through the deploy
node (rather than the target nodes) so that the download
is done once, then pushed to the targets. This can be
adjusted with the right parameters to download from the
targets instead.

Also, in https://review.openstack.org/543888 adjustments
were made to disable compression/qpress on architectures
other than x86_64, and to fail the role execution if it
was enabled on any other architecture. This has been
corrected to ensure that compression is enabled by default
for ppc64le on Ubuntu, and enabled by default for x86_64,
but disabled by default for all other combinations. The
fail task is adjusted appropriately and moved to the main
task file so that it executes and fails out before any
changes are made.

In https://review.openstack.org/547015 we adjusted
the apt installation process to ensure that the cache
update happens after the repository changes, but left
out the explicit instruction not to do it in the task
which changes the repo config.

This patch adds that, but also seperates out the cache
update into its own task so that the package install
task remains more readable.

If apt_repository fails to update the apt cache after updating the
configuration, retries don't register there was a change and so no
attempt is made to update the cache by the module on the second attempt.
This failure can result in a failure to install packages.

This change adds an apt module task to update the cache if the

will get retried on failure and no longer fail silently.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

The selection list arguments had a mutually exclusive flag set for no
reason. There previously was a limitation in how the flags were used
previously which made those flags mutually exclusive, however that
hasn't been the case for some time. At the same time the docs on
selection needed to be updated, because they showed incorrect internal
details (even prior to the stestr migration) for the blacklist file.
Instead of trying to detail the entire explanation, it now just links
to the stestr docs.
