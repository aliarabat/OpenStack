Currently rpc loop processes ports only in case polling is required
(message from ovsdb monitor) or there are port_updated notifications from
server or security group notifications.
In case of just port_deleted notifications port processing is not
triggered during rpc loop.
This may lead to agent accumulating a big amount of deleted ports
and processing all of them at once during next iteration when polling is
required or any notification from server, which might be quite tough for
the agent. Tough means agent will be irresponsive while processing deleted
ports.
The patch makes port deletion processing more gradual.

Currently Solum uses notion of assembly quite extensively in
worker/shell.py and deployer/heat.py. While we are introducing
the new workflow resource and related objects, we want to ensure that
we can start using the workflow resource without having to wait for
complete overhaul of worker and deployer.

So to achieve this goal we have introduced an apapter class
in the workflow_handler. The adapter class provides a method to
create a plan and an assembly. This method is invoked upon each
POST to workflow. A one-to-one association is maintained between
each workflow and the corresponding created assembly.

Finally, to complete the end-to-end deployment we have introduced
a method in the deployer/heat.py to update the 'app' corresponding
to the invoked workflow with the status and the url of the
deployed application.

While we are introducing the workflow resource and related objects, we
want to ensure that we remain backwards compatible with the assembly

within Solum. Especially, the worker/shell.py and deployer/heat.py make
heavy use of the assembly abstraction.

With this patch we are adding a weak one-to-one association between
workflows and assemblies.

We have also introduced the workflow_table and have added some required
fields to the app table.

This patch contains the following two fixes
because the gate job fails if they are not applied
at the same time.

1) Use OS::Heat::TestResource in test templates

Use OS::Heat::TestResource instead of OS::Nova::Server
in heat_minimal.yaml and heat_minimal_hot.yaml

2) Update path to subunit2html in post_test_hook

Per:

http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-August/072982.html

The location of subunit2html changed on the images in the gate
so update the path used in the post_test_hook.

Long-term we should just use what's in devstack-gate.

We have a basic implementation for a fallback mechanism that will use v1
rather than v2 when downloading schema files from glance-api fails.
However, this is not sound. If the schemas are cached already, we won't
check if v2 is available and fail to fallback.

This patch fixes the aforementioned issue by getting the list of
available versions from the server only when the API versions was not
explicitly specified through the CLI. That is, for all commands that
don't pass `--os-image-api-version 2`, we'll check v2's availability and
we'll fallback to v1 if it isn't available.

This patch also changes how we handle `/versions` calls in the client.
The server has been, incorrectly, replying to requests to `/version`
with a 300 error, which ended up in the client re-raising such
exception. While I think 300 shouldn't raise an exception, I think we
should handle that in a spearate patch. Therefore, this patch just
avoids raising such exception when `/version` is explicitly called.

This fallback behaviour and the check on `/versions` will be removed in
future versions of the client. The later depends on this bug[0] being
fixed.

A change[1] injected a direct route to metadata ip through a subnet's
default gateway to avoid Windows mac resolution. Such route is incorrect
when metadata proxy service is disabled on l3 agents and there is no way
to overload it because it's a route to a /32 subnet.

This change propose to replace current metadata proxy to router:
 destination=169.254.169.254/32,nexthop=router-ip
by:
 destination=169.254.169.254/31,nexthop=router-ip
And VMs will use dhcp metadata proxy service when available[2] and
router one when available[3].

Using different masklens avoid to define yet another complicated
configuration option enabling/disabling previous change[1] feature.

OpenSSH 6.8 changed the default hash method to SHA256. OpenSSH 6.7 and
older don't support the -E command line option to specify the hash
method.

First try without -E since most Linux distribution for OpenStack Kilo
still use OpenSSH 6.7. If OpenSSH 6.8 and newer is detected (hash method
specified in the output), call again ssh-keygen with -E md5 to hash the
fingerprint using MD5.

This change fixes the two following tests on Fedora 22:

* nova.tests.unit.api.ec2.test_cloud.CloudTestCase.test_import_key_pair
* nova.tests.unit.compute.test_keypairs.ImportKeypairTestCase.test_success_ssh

novaclient 2.27.0 introduced the API microversion discovery and client.Client
now wants an api_version argument to properly work out the correct API
version in use.  OSC needs to provide this when required.

Letting the compute client plugin do the version validity checking makes more
sense than encoding it into shell.py, so I've added a new OSC plugin interface
function check_api_version() that is called from shell.py if it exists.  If it
either does not exist or it returns False the previous version checking using
API_VERSIONS is still performed.

compute.client.check_api_version() conditionally imports the new
novaclient.api_versions module and uses it if successful.  Otherwise
check_api_version() returns False and the previous code path is resumed.

One side-effect of this is that it is now valid to use --os-compute-api-version
with any valid microversion supported by the installed python-novaclient.

to create symbolic links for these libraries instead of creating
a huge package which contains the same library as the distro provides

Now devstack upgrades the urllib3 to incompatible version,
but it leaves the requests unchanged because Fedora already has the
latest version.
The issue does not happens with Ubuntu because it has older requests
and devstack updates it as well.
The pip installed version contains a bundled urllib3 and the actually
installed urllib3 version does not matters.

This is not the `usual` distro package overrides pip installed package

Keepalived could be used to maintain a virtual IP address per VRRP protocol,
monitor a process as specified, and perform fail-over when it detects a failure
in the monitored process.

The role includes a default vrrp_script for monitoring haproxy and the provided
keepalived-install.yml playbook installs the keepalived to haproxy_hosts.
However, a variable named ""keepalived_instances"" needs be defined with
deployment details for keepalived otherwise the keepalived daemon will be

Previously such operation was defined for sequences only (implementations
of collection.Sequence with exception of strings and dicts - 
currently it is only list (tuple) - fixed-size indexable collections). 
Now it is defined for iterables (i.e. things you can iterate over

DVR routers with external gateway set has internal csnat
ports that are mapped to the SNAT namespace.
For every corresponding router interface there will be a
csnat interface configured in the SNAT namepsace.
When you delete or remove a router interface the corresponding
csnat interface should be removed from the SNAT namespace by
the agent.

Right now the csnat interface is not removed by the agent.

This was caused by the l3 agent refactor.

While installing the API service and Engine, sample configuration file
is needed to generate inside murano/murano using tox. Hence add cd
command.

While installing and running murano with devstack, environment
variable DEVSTACK_DIR is used. Add export command to set environment
varible. Neutron additional service is also required by murano which
do not come by default with devstack. It is mention and add command to
enable it.

ObjectStore used to replace object factories with actual objects
only after 2 passes instead of after first pass as it was before then.
Until that happened object could not be obtained from outside
despite it was already created by the 2nd pass so ID reference
resolution that happened on the second pass failed.

With this fix ObjectStore doesn't tries to hide partially-initialized
objects anymore. So if object A references object B by ID
it may get B after B has been loaded but before its .init was called.
That's not a problem because we just loading (relinking) model
and do not depend on anything that could be initialized in B's .init.
However because B is not owned by A and A is not owned by B
it may happen that .init of A will be executed prior to .init of B
so if A's initializer will see object B that wasn't initialized yet.
Generally this is unavoidable because there may be circular
references. So there were 2 options: either to do more that 2
passes and try to to avoid such situations for cases when
there are no circular references or just require classes not
to do anything with objects they don't own from .init.
Because .init is also called from GC and should not have
side effects at all the second options was chosen but
we may reconsider this in the future

The async_ping function returns a callable that returns True when all ping
futures are done. Since those futures are running for 10 secs, there was no
chance that the result of the callable was True.

The test was bailing out without calling bridge reset even a single time,
effectively leaving the feature untested in gate.

Another thing to note is that for some reason the patch fixed oslo rootwrap
errors in the test when executed locally. Since I still don't understand how
it's possible that it fixes the issue for me, I mark the bug as related only,
and will track logstash after it's merged to see whether it applies unknown
magic to gate jobs too.

As per https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/deprecate-v1-api
the Cinder API v1 was designated as deprecated in Juno and was meant
to be removed in Kilo, but appears to still be usable in Kilo.

This patch configures Nova to use the Cinder v2 API instead of the
v1 API.

This patch configures Tempest to test both the Cinder v1 and v2 API's
for now. Once the API is removed upstream we can change this.

If we don't explicitly set cinder as the service name, and then try and
install cinder onto a host that already has other services (such as
when you're installing cionder-volume ontobare metal where other
services exist), then the cinder plays get run with 'something else' as
the service name.  i.e., if installing ciner-volume onto a compute host
that has nova and neutron, then the cinder plays get run with neutron
as the service name.

This commit explicitly includes the cinder_all groups vars file, which
itself explicitly sets cinder as the service name.

This patch deals with the lock wait timeout and the deadlock errors
observed under high concurrency (api_workers >= 4) with the pymysql
driver. It includes the following changes:

- Stop setting dirty status for resource usage when creating
  reservation, as usage of reserved resources is not tracked anymore;
- Add a variable, increasing delay when retrying make_reservation
  upon a DBDeadlock error in order to reduce the chances of further
  collisions;
- Enable transaction retry upon DBDeadlock errors for set_quota_usage;
- Do not resync quota usage while making reservation. This puts a lot
  of stress on the database and is also wasteful since resource usage
  is very likely to change again once the transaction is committed;
- Use autonested_transaction to simplify logic around when the
  nested flag should be used.

Fix unit test errors caused by new mock version

This patch corrects a few errors that is currently breaking the gate
checks.  The trigger of these errors is an upgrade to Mock, but the
root is subtle issues with how Mock was being used.  All of these
changes will work correctly with the old and new versions of Mock.

1) Fix missing attribute errors (calls to non existing assert checks)
2) Fix use of assert_has_calls() (parameter should be a list)
3) Don't assume name of Mock instance
4) Upgrade to use of newer PBR to address import errors
       (this change will be forthcoming from an infra-bot)
5) Update versions based on CR 201162
6) Add python-subunit explicitly to test-requirements.txt
7) Remove extra pip install of tempest; use version from test-requirements

Attempt to fix the linked bug by initialising the mock instance for
Connection.delete_object before calling the SwiftService upload
method, so that the delete_object mock already exists before the
delete_segments jobs that run in multiple threads call it.  Otherwise
there is a risk that the delete_segment job threads could race while
creating either the delete_object mock or the
delete_object.return_value mock, resulting in each thread getting a
different instance. That would explain the intermittent test failures
reported in the bug.

LibreSwan checks for the presence of pid/ctl files when starting up and
will error out if they already exist. However, LibreSwan's usage of the
capabilities library removes the access required to cleanup .ctl and
.pid files on shutdown if any of the directories in the path are missing
explicit permissions for root. This is not considered a bug by the
LibreSwan maintainers, so the LibreSwan driver must work around it by
checking if it is okay to remove the files and removing them on
startup. It must also wait for shutdown to complete before restarting
the daemon on LibreSwanProcess.restart().

Introduces new configuration for retrying check for process shutdown.

This has some advantages over the heat.conf option, e.g it allows
for much easier customzation of the user configuration (additional
SSH keys, adding groups etc), and also in future if we support
deploying more than one overcloud you could specify a different
user per deployment.

The internal cache (common.filecache) uses dogpile.cache's dbm backend,
which uses the bsddb package from the standardlib (in py2 only). bsddb
however breaks with a TypeError if the cache key is a unicode string.

This change fixes this by using the ``key_mangler`` arg on cache
creation, which (according to the dogpile.cache docs) is to be used with
dbm/bsddb.

With the creation of the new openstack_config provider, some processing
that was done in glance_api_config has been centralized in
openstack_config.

The same changes apply for glance_registry_config and
glance_cache_config

Impacted methods are :

  * section
  * setting
  * separator

Also, this commit adds the fact that, when passing a specific string
(ensure_absent_val) the provider will behave as if ensure => absent was
specified. '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' is the default value for
ensure_absent_val.

The use case is the following :

glance_api_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => 'bar' } # will work as usual

glance_api_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' } # will mean absent

That means that all the current :

if $myvar {
  glance_api_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => $myvar }
} else {
  glance_api_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : ensure => absent }
}

can be removed in favor of :

glance_api_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => $myvar }

If for any reason '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' turns out to be a valid value for
a specific parameter. One could by pass that doing the following :

glance_api_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => '<SERVICE DEFAULT>',
ensure_absent_val => 'foo' }

This patch removes all SHA specifications for the OpenStack clients
so that any client requirement versions are determined solely from
the requirements of the OpenStack service and Global requirements
files.

This resolves issues where the client versions we carry are
incompatible with the services, resulting in unexpected failures.

The Tempest SHA configuration is moved into openstack_other so that
it can be addressed seperately when updating the SHA's. This will
be useful when master is branched to become liberty and all the
OpenStack services start to track an upstream stable/liberty branch.

The Global Requirements SHA configuration is shifted to
openstack_services for a similar reason. It will track an upstream
stable/liberty branch with all the openstack services.

This change replaces the cliff-tablib json formatter with an internal
replacement. It differs from the tablib formatter in the following ways:
- by default outputs with an indent of 2 spaces. The --noindent formatting
  argument outputs with no indentation, to save space or to pipe to tools
  which can't handle multi-line input.
- emit_one serialises a simple dict where the column name is the key
and the data item is the value (rather than a list of dicts with
'Field' and 'Value' keys)

The cliff release which contains this change will need a corresponding
cliff-tablib release which removes the json formatter from its setup.py
entry_points.

The rolling update code is capable of scaling the ResourceGroup down to the
correct size at the end of the rolling update, so allow it do so rather
than appending a separate scale-down step.

This change makes the _get_batches() function as simple as it can be - it
now differs from the one used by InstanceGroup only in that resources that
will later be deleted (because their indices are too high) are not counted
as updated.

This testcase may fail intermittently on 'Connection refused' error.
This could be due to the fact that the metadata proxy setup is not exactly
complete at the time the request is issued; in fact there is no
synchronization between the router being up and the metadata request being
issued, and clearly this may be the reason of accidental but seldom failures.

In order to rule out this possibility and stabilize the test, let's retry
on connection refused only. If we continue to fail, then the next step would
be to dump the content of iptables to figure out why the error occurs.

  aserver:
    type: OS::Nova::Server
    metadata:
      os-collect-config:

This technique may be useful to provide additional configuration data
to os-collect-config, other than the credentials etc heat provides
internally, so instead of overwriting the os-collect-config map
merge with anything defined in the template (if it exists).

Note if there are collisions between the template and the keys used
internally the internal data will take precedence (same as current
behavior but without overriting the entire map).

When calling delete we need the pci slot details to reset the VF rate. The problem
is that when the VM is deleted libvirt return the VF to the hypervisor and eswitch
manager will mark the pci_slot as unassigned so can't know from the mac which pci slot (VF)
to reset. Also newer libvirt version reset the mac when deleteing VM, so than it is
not possible at all.
The solution is to keep pci slot details locally in the agent since upon removal event
you cannot get pci_slot from the neutron server as it is for create/update since port
is already removed from neutron.

This patch pairs the mac and pci_slot for a device (VF) so when calling the extension
port delete api we can have the pci_slot and reset the VF rate.

It is also add a mapping between mac to port_id so we can pass the port_id
when calling the extention port delete api.

Service[ceph] was supposed to restart ceph daemons after ceph
package update, but fuel deploys packages before starting daemons.

Exec[service ceph reload] was supposed to reload monitors after
updating mon_host and mon_initial_members configuration parameters,
but this parameters used by the monitor only once, on the first start.

Actually they have already been noop for some time on upstart system,
due to wrong service name (one should use ceph-all instead of ceph).

It worked accidentaly on older releases beacuse ceph-deploy
incorrectly created sysvinit file on upstart systems, but now this
causes problems during upgrade.

This fix ensures that l3 route has been cleared
before we try to set default route. This is very
important for admin interface on the nodes that
do not have default gateway configured as they
need to go through admin node during deployment
stage.

This issue affects environments with subinterfaces
for admin interface as we cannot add new route
through new interface in runtime as we already
have default gateway through the different interface
which is eth0/eth1 almost each time.

E.g.

default via 10.109.17.1 dev eth1

should become

default via 10.109.17.1 dev br-fw-admin

But l3_clear_route does not understand that these routes
are different and thus does not clear the first one.
This in fact leads to inability to set default route
by puppet l3_ifconfig provider. Look into
https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1447638 for more
details.

This fix adds 'interface' property into l3_clear_route
puppet type which is a hacky w/a for l23network ip route
management.

It also ensures that if route iface is changed we need to
recreate the route.

This patch fixes a regression where, if neutron was loaded using
--config-dir, the service_providers option was no longer available.

We bring the logic back (removed by 61121c5f2af), alongside the ability
to load the option auto-magically. This is especially required for DevStack
deployments as of today, because neutron-server is only loaded by passing
--config-file (...)neutron.conf and --config-file (...)ml2_conf.ini

Currently Nailgun doesn't support declarative scale-down mechanism, and
therefore there's no way to trigger some task execution if some node has
been removed from the environment, and that's incredibly annoying for
plugin developers.

Plugin developers could come up with a workaround, and have a deal with
/etc/hiera/nodes.yaml. Unfortunately, this file isn't updated on node
removal event. This commit is going to fix it, and send two tasks on
execution if case of node removal:

* update /etc/hiera/nodes.yaml
* update /etc/hosts

When the switch was made to the Openstack CLI, the Identity API v3 was
being taken into account. And that's the way it worked when the CR was
introduced. But for some reason, the gate is now taking v2 into account
(Which was the original behaviur).

This is problematic in the sense that commands related to identity v2
have a different syntax than commands related to identity v3.

This CR sets v3 specifically in the problematic commands, since it's the
syntax that we were considering initially. And also the goal is to move
towards the usage of Identity v3 as much as possible.

Currently Nailgun doesn't support declarative scale-down mechanism, and
therefore there's no way to trigger some task execution if some node has
been removed from the environment, and that's incredibly annoying for
plugin developers.

Plugin developers could come up with a workaround, and have a deal with
/etc/hiera/nodes.yaml. Unfortunately, this file isn't updated on node
removal event. This commit is going to fix it, and send two tasks on
execution if case of node removal:

* update /etc/hiera/nodes.yaml
* update /etc/hosts

The thing is nodes when being provisioned have
'interfaces' field which contains all the information
about network interfaces. This field is formatted here
nailgun/nailgun/orchestrator/provisioning_serializers.py:serialize_interfaces
and we can use this field to find system in the Cobbler
with the same MAC addresses if there exist any.
However, deletion task contains nodes which
do not have 'interfaces' field. So, we can try to
find nodes by their MACs only during provisioning,
not during deletion.

Besides, this original bug #1491725 used to appear
only during provisioning and this MAC based hack should
only be used where it is really needed.

The thing is nodes when being provisioned have
'interfaces' field which contains all the information
about network interfaces. This field is formatted here
nailgun/nailgun/orchestrator/provisioning_serializers.py:serialize_interfaces
and we can use this field to find system in the Cobbler
with the same MAC addresses if there exist any.
However, deletion task contains nodes which
do not have 'interfaces' field. So, we can try to
find nodes by their MACs only during provisioning,
not during deletion.

Besides, this original bug #1491725 used to appear
only during provisioning and this MAC based hack should
only be used where it is really needed.

rbd is the only example of a currently supported image storage
backend where it makes sense to put the config drive in the
configured storage backend instead of local hypervisor disk. I
don't think this makes sense for LVM, where we would be creating
a LV for a tens of megabytes file, which seems like overkill to
me. The other storage backends use local disk for their data
already.

This use case was covered by the now reverted changes:
  228d0221763b12f11ecbacde4db38b1151f96e31
  0b01e846d40f3b343da9ebe1dae89cca8bc2ac66
  ecce888c469c62374a3cc43e3cede11d8aa1e799

Support this special case by moving the image to rbd once it has
been created in the local instance directory on the hypervisor.

I've tested this change in devstack and it works.

This will reduce coverage around legacy v2 code, but it should increase
coverage of the default configuration, where all extensions are always
turned on.

WIP - turns out this will be a massive change, might be for mitaka now

Right now it’s using a special built volume_updates dictionary that
contains some fields *and* a model update. We then glom all of them
together into an update dictionary for the volume model.

This change simplifies them into a single model update more in-line with
how the other volume API’s work for drivers.

It also fixes a bug where the model_update property of the volume_update
was not being applied to the db model.

Remove the specification in tox.ini that _ is a builtin so that
it will no longer assume that _ does not need to be imported.
This helps ensure that the _ from i18n is used.

Activating this check did not flag any violations.

This adds a pip install command to tox.ini that is only used when the
tox env is passed with the 'constraints' factor appended onto it.
As such this will not effect developer workflows or current unit tests.

The initial use of this will be in a non-voting job, to verify that the
constrained checks with tox are stable.  DevStack is already running
constrained jobs, as such problems are no expected.

To run a tox with pip using constraints on a developer system a
developer should run the desired tox environment with -constraints.
For example: $(tox -epy27-constraints)
Pip will pull the current version of the upper-constraints.txt file down
from the git.openstack.org, however this method can be overriden to use
a local file setting the environment variable ""UPPER_CONSTRAINTS_FILE""
to the local path or a different URL, it is passed directly to pip.

This is currently not enabled in the default tox run, however it is
possible to enable it as a default by adding it to 'envlist' in tox.ini
