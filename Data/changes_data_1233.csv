This patch enables check to make sure that murano-api.conf.sample
is always up to date. To make sure that your change keeps the sample
config in sync you can run:
$ tox -e pep8

It'll generate a config file from current source code and will
compare it with etc/murano/murano.sample.conf

getopt workaround for OS X users:
* install GNU getopt by using homebrew (brew install gnu-getopt) or
  macports (port install getopts);
* add it to the PATH before the actual getopt before running tox;
* if you'd like to make it default just add it to your bashrc/zshrc/etcrc,
  for example, for brew you should add:
  export PATH=$(brew --prefix gnu-getopt)/bin:$PATH

Side effects:
Turns out our code depends on posix_ipc through
openstack/common/lockutils.py. Added it to requirements.txt

The first paragraph of the building block section of the compute admin
guide implies that an ephemeral instance will loose it's state on
shutdown of the instance.  Shutdown may imply deletion, but as there
is a shutdown state that does not remove the ephemeral volume, it
is more appropriate to talk about the deletion of the virtual
instance.  This change addresses that inconsistency.

This change adds a minor refactor to the sahara.service.trusts module to
add generic creation and destruction methods as well as specific methods
used during transient cluster management.

These changes are in support of greater trust usage within the Sahara
code base. Previously only transient cluster management used trusts and
the creation/desutruction methods were customized to that end.

Changes
* renamed create_trust to create_trust_for_cluster
* renamed delete_trust to delete_trust_from_cluster
* added create_trust
* added delete_trust
* changed sahara.service.ops to use new _cluster specific trust methods
* added logging messages to trust creation and deletion
* changed delete trust to throw a DeletionFailed exception
* added CreationFailed exception

During Icehouse, we decided to pull the metadata out of the queue
endpoint by adding a new endpoint `/metadata`. This worked well because
we didn't have a clear view of what the scope of metadata is. Now that
we want to use it and make it a key piece of the queues, we've found
that the workflow is not as clear as we'd like. The reason being that
some key items of the metadata - flavor, for example - need to be
specified during the queue creation and not after.

Merging these endpoints together is enough to fix this issue.

With the acceptance of the v2 LBaaS object model we will be required to
support both the original v1 (soon to be deprecated) and v2
side-by-side. Not surprisingly these two modelsshare a number of object
types (ie. pools, members, etc.) In order to handle this overlap of
object names, the API prefixes v1 with /lb whereas v2 is prefixed with
/lbaas.

This presents a problem for python-neutronclient in that resource name
alone (until now) was adequate for the string interpolation that helps
derive the method name to be called. Now that we have, for instance,
two different ""pool"" objects, we need a way to handle each uniquely.

Therefore, in order to maintain backwards compatibility, and minimize
complexity, this change introduces the concept of a shadow resource.
This shadow recource is used to direct the client at the correct paths
and methods to call internally, get still leverage the same logic that
has enabled resources to be manipulated by the de facto resource name.

Shadow resources are only necessary when an API is in this particular
type of scenario: the deprecation of a previous and overlapping former
API. Otherwise, new and existing API's can continue to use the same
logic as before.

This change also moves the 'resource' attributes from the Neutron
subclasses into NeutronCommand itself  as they were common to all the
subcommands already.

Currently, user can lock/unlock an instance which is already locked/unlocked,

difference the lock/unlock action:

This converts all templates to be valid HOT.

Fn::Select is not converted in this change but this will actually
work with heat_template_version 2013-05-23. Fn::Select is converted

This change also sets the heat_template_version to 2014-10-16 which

To enable OSprofiler we should be able to add ""profiler"" notification
topic to ceilometer notification topics.

It won't add any overhead to Ceilometer until we start
using OSprofiler.

To use OSprofiler we have to add special trace information in
request headers that will produce actually trigger profiler,
that will send bunch of notifications.

This mostly will be used by Rally, and probably one of

The code was elevating context before requesting networks which
means that the project_only code is skipped and all networks
could be retrieved. This means that the default networks returned
by FlatDhcpManager could include networks that belong to other
projects.

This fixes the issue by requesting the network without elevating
the context, re-enabling the proper project checking. It includes
tests to verify that the proper exception is raised when an
illegal network is requested and that the context has not been
elevated by the compute manager.

This change adds common methods which allow resources
to handle client exceptions without needing to directly
import the exception types.

The most common client resource exception handling is:
* Detecting if an exception is a 404
* Raising any exception which is not a 404
* Detecting if an exception is a 413 (over limit)
* Detecting if an exception was raised by a particular client
  library

Subsequent changes will move to using these methods.

  tests must record which, how many, and in what order policy checks
  should be expected
* Test requests look more like actual requests; rather than calling the

  infrastructure and all input/output must be valid as far as the wsgi
  is concerned.

Previously, req_timeout and http_timeout were set to the same value
which is not correct. req_timeout is the total time limit for a cluster
request and  http_timeout is the time allowed before aborting a request on
an unresponsive controller. Since the default configuration allows 2
retries req_timeout should be double that of http_timeout because of this
this patch goes ahead and removes req_timeout as this should just be
http_timeout * retries.

Because prevouly req_timeout and http_timeout were the same this exposed
a corner case that when the nsx controller returned a 307 we would issue
the request against the redirected controller but in the case where the
session cookie had expire when the request was issued we would get a 401
response back and never retry the request. Now that the default values are
corrected this issue should no longer occur as the next time time we issue
the request we'll fetch a new auth cookie for the redirected controller.

This patch also bumps the timeout values to be higher. We've seen
more and more timeouts occur in our CI system largely because our
cloud is overloaded so increasing the default timeouts will *hopefully*
help reduce test failures.

This patch refactors the flush tokens functionality to have a pluggable
expiration range strategy that can be customized based on database
backend.  The batch size method has been replaced with a method that
will return an appropriate iterator for choosing expiration ranges.

This patch also allows MySQL to use the batch flush functionality to
alleviate problems with Galera replication and large write sets.  Galera
has a modest size limit (1GB) on how large write sets can grow and this
can be reached fairly easily if you run expiration infrequently, or just
have a high token issue rate.

This also changes the mechanism to do batch flushes to a more portable
mechanism that does not require subquery support w/LIMIT.  MySQL does
not support DELETE with a subquery that uses LIMIT.

The batch expiration strategy will return a timestamp each time it's
called.  The flush function will then delete all expired tokens up to
that timestamp.  It is possible that this will delete somewhat more than
the `batch_size` number of rows, but it is expected that it will
typically be close to that number, and will effectively chunk the work
into roughly equal size batches.

Currently, we have logic in the Resource.signal base-class implementation
which works out the reason string based on knowledge of some of the
signal-handling resources.  This is invariably going to be fragile, and it
won't work at all with any out of tree or contrib plugins.

So instead, move towards a model where we accept an optional return value from
handle_signal, and use that as the reason string instead.  Since no resources
yet return a reason, maintain the old logic as a fallback path, until this
gets migrated into the appropriate resources.

For some time now use_default_quota_class has been the
default setting for Cinder.  Cinder, however, has not been putting
any defaults for the default quota class into the database.  This
resulted in any command that queried for the default quotas to cause
the message ""Deprecated: Default quota for resource: <resource> is set
by the default quota flag: <quota flag>, it is now deprecated.  Please use
the default quota class for default quota.""

This commit resolves this issue by setting the default value for volumes,
snapshots and gigabytes in the quota_class table at migration time if there
is not already a class_name of 'default' in the quota_classes table.

Unit tests are included with this commit.

There is a remote chance that this operation may
be prone to DB integrity errors, in case the binding
is attempted on the same port twice.

Ideally getter methods should not create, but this
is a common Neutron (anti)-pattern that would be
difficult to eradicate (at least in a single patch);
so for now let's make this code more defensive.

Neutron currently does not implement the nova extension

the default security group when a tenant is onboarded. Implementing this
type of functionality should be done in neutron directly as proxying the
api calls to do this from nova is not possible as neutron creates the

When a gateway is set to a distributed router,
the router checks for the interfaces associated
with the router and based on the number of
interfaces the router creates ""csnat"" interface
ports that would be used by the SNAT service in
the Service Node.

When a gateway is cleared, the plugin should
delete the ""csnat"" interface ports. In the
current code, it is deleting the port and
re-creating the port with a different id.

A check need to be made before it creates a new
port to make sure that the router has a valid
gateway port.

This is a bug and this patch fixes this issue.

In the case where a stack that has a watch task associated with it is
being deleted and the engine successfully acquires a lock, no attempt to
stop the stack will be made since it has no action in-progress.  This
will result in orphaned watcher tasks being left behind, since the
watcher tasks are normally stopped as part of the call to
ThreadGroup.stop().

If config two backends on the same storage, but the protocol is
different, one is FC and the other is iSCSI,  that will create two
hosts on the storage.

When detaching the volume which is attached to the iSCSI host, the
driver will get FC host by default, that causes volume status keeps
'detaching'.

If we configure config_drive_cdrom=True in nova.conf,

I attempted to use this function and found a few problems.

We shouldn’t unlink the file after closing it, because someone else could lock
it in between.  Switch to unlink before close.

If someone else locked the file between our open and flock, they are likely to
unlink it out from underneath us.  Then we have a lock on a file that no longer
exists.  So stat the filename after locking to make sure the inode hasn't
changed or gone away.

We probably shouldn’t unlink the file if we time out waiting for a lock.  So
move that to before the finally block.

A long, long time ago, on a GET request, the proxy would go look on 3*
nodes for the requested thing. If one of the primary nodes was
error-limited, it'd look on two primaries and a handoff. Since this
indicated some failure somewhere, the proxy would emit a warning:
""Handoff requested (1)"". If two primaries were down, there'd be a
second message ""Handoff requested (2)"", and so on.

Some StatsD messages were emitted too.

A somewhat shorter time ago (commit d79a67eb), the proxy started
looking into handoffs if it got 404s from the primaries. While this
was a good idea, it resulted lots of ""Handoff requested (N)"" log spam;
you'd see these messages on every single 404. Also, the StatsD
handoff_count and handoff_all_count metrics shot way up and turned
into noise.

This commit restores the original intent (and usefulness) of the log
messages and StatsD metrics: if the proxy only looks at the normal
number of handoff nodes, nothing is logged. However, if a primary is
down, then the message ""Handoff requested (1)"" will be logged,
indicating that the proxy looked at one more handoff than it normally
would, and this happened because a primary node was error-limited.

This patch takes a first step towards support
for object system metadata by enabling headers
in the x-object-sysmeta- namespace to be
persisted when objects are PUT. This should be
useful for other pending patches such as on
demand migration and server side encryption
(https://review.openstack.org/#/c/64430/ and
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/76578/1).

The x-object-sysmeta- namespace is already
reserved/protected by the gatekeeper and
passed through the proxy. This patch modifies
the object server to persist these headers
alongside user metadata when an object is
PUT.

This patch will preserve existing object
system metadata and ignore any new system
metadata when handling object POSTs,
including POST-as-copy operations. Support
for modification of object system metadata
with a POST request requires further work
as discussed in the blueprint.

This patch will preserve existing object
system metadata and update it with new
system metadata when copying an object.

A new probe test is added which makes use of
the BrainSplitter class that has been moved
from test_container_merge_policy_index.py to
a new module brain.py.

RFC 2616 says that HTTP header fields are case-insensitive.  However, there are
some S3 clients who don't accept normalized header by Swift and Eventlet.  For
example, AWS Java SDK expects that an etag header is 'ETag', not 'Etag'.

This patch disables Eventlet's header capitalization so that the swift3
middleware can normalize the response headers as those clients expect.

Note that this change requires a fix for Eventlet, which will be included in

This change looks for the use of 'password' in the data that
is sent and uses mask_password() to remove the actual password
text.  This change will prevent debug output that is being
saved from saving passwords.

A test case is added to verify that password output is being removed.

Resources which go into an unknown or error state currently
raise an Error exception. There are cases where Error is too
generic to make decisions on, so 2 new exceptions have been
created:
* ResourceInError: raised when a resource goes to a status which
  is known to represent an error for that resource
* ResourceUnknownStatus: raised when a resource goes to a status
  which heat is not aware of. If ResourceUnknownStatus is ever raised
  then this is a heat bug, since this is a status which heat is not

Any resource which go into an in-progress state has been updated to
raise ResourceInError and ResourceUnknownStatus where appropriate.

Commit 1e1915aaaca38b5691794e0e052a42b9d95dd3c2 introduced a new
utility method to shutdown a VM. This will now be moved to vm_util
similar to refactoring in blueprint vmware-spawn-refactor.

This patch does the following:
1. Creates a vm_util method - power_off_instance.
2. Corrects the unit test for the unrescue. That did not correctly validate
   the correct vm ref for the power off
3. Added specific tests for the new method that has been added
4. Drops the test test_power_off_suspended as this is not a valid test
   case.

The initial commit to allow graphviz images in documentation used
a sphinx extension relying on googlechart (which just sends the .dot files
to a google API and let's them render it). It turns out google's
implementation of the .dot renderer is quite out of date, and there's a
better module we can include which doesn't rely on this third party service
anyway.

This patch takes a first step towards support
for object system metadata by enabling headers
in the x-object-sysmeta- namespace to be
persisted when objects are PUT. This should be
useful for other pending patches such as on
demand migration and server side encryption
(https://review.openstack.org/#/c/64430/ and
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/76578/1).

The x-object-sysmeta- namespace is already
reserved/protected by the gatekeeper and
passed through the proxy. This patch modifies
the object server to persist these headers
alongside user metadata when an object is
PUT.

This patch will preserve existing object
system metadata and ignore any new system
metadata when handling object POSTs,
including POST-as-copy operations. Support
for modification of object system metadata
with a POST request requires further work
as discussed in the blueprint.

This patch will preserve existing object
system metadata and update it with new
system metadata when copying an object.

A new probe test is added which makes use of
the BrainSplitter class that has been moved
from test_container_merge_policy_index.py to
a new module brain.py.

ovs vxlan become supported on most distribution and provides
isolated `multi tenant` networking without special `vlan` aware switch.

In single node deployment you will just see the br-tun ovs bridge
created.

In multi-node setup you might need to adjust the MTU settings.

If your physical switch supports >=1550 MTU size
 probably you will not see any issue.

If your guest image honors the MTU size offered via dhcp,
you can adjust your dnsmask settings with the correct (likely 1450 byte)
MTU size.

cirros (udhcp) does not honors these setting, you might need to
set lower MTU size on br-ex and/or adjust network_device_mtu option
in your local.conf.

The default changed, because it will be used with the multi-node neutron
jobs.

If you want the original behavior for whatever reason add these to your
`local.conf`:
ENABLE_TENANT_TUNNELS=False
Q_ML2_TENANT_NETWORK_TYPE=local

This patch adds the openstack policy integration bits which we can use to
enforce which congress api calls can be made by a normal tenant
vs admin tenant. Today the default policy.json defaults to requiring an
admin to make an API call. Though, for example, one could add the following
to policy.json to allow a non-admin tenant to create a data-source:

""create_data_sources"": ""rule:regular_user""

This patch also renames Context to RequestContext and drops some unneeded code.

In order to continue using the Kafka High Consumer API, the disruptor
was removed. This allows a direct call to to kafka to commit the offsets
when items are flushed.

Different ConsumerConnectors had to be created for Metrics and Alarms
so the offsets could be committed separately

Changed configuration to match the new model.  Remove configuration
parameters that were no longer needed

Changed the name Disruptor to Pipeline

Allow only one EventHandler per pipeline

Added code to flush the Metrics and Alarms, and shutdown the Kafka ConsumerConnections on a normal shutdown. This keeps the persister from losing Metrics and Alarms.

Made measurementTimeStampSimpleDateFormat not static since SimpleDateFormat is not thread safe

Changed some logging debug statements so Strings weren't created if debug not on

Created FlushableHandler as a base class and moved duplicate code into it from MetricHandler and AlarmStateTransitionHistoryHandler

The domain name gets added to the initiator name used by the host
if it's an Active Directory member.

Currently the method which gets the initiator name does not take
this into account when retrieving the default initiator name.

Trying to use a wrong initiator name will lead to an exception when
trying to log in to the according iSCSI target.

This patch simply appends the domain name (when the host is an AD
member) to the initiator name used to log in to iSCSI targets.

This change adds an EDP engine for a Spark standalone cluster.
The engine uses the spark-submit script and various linux
commands via ssh to run, monitor, and terminate Spark jobs.

Currently, the Spark engine can launch ""Java"" job types (this is
the same type used to submit Oozie Java action on Hadoop clusters)

A directory is created for each Spark job on the master node which
contains jar files, the script used to launch the job, the
job's stderr and stdout, and a result file containing the exit
status of spark-submit.  The directory is named after the Sahara
job and the job execution id so it is easy to locate.  Preserving
these files is a big help in debugging jobs.

A few general improvements are included:
* engine.cancel_job() may return updated job status
* engine.run_job() may return job status and fields for job_execution.extra
in addition to job id

Still to do:
* create a proper Spark job type (new CR)
* make the job dir location on the master node configurable (new CR)
* add something to clean up job directories on the master node (new CR)
* allows users to pass some general options to spark-submit itself (new CR)

There was a bug in the code that checked to see if the
appropriate WWPN for a preferred node was available on the storage
host in intialize_connection.  It was assumed that there would only
ever be one preferred WWPN.  The code just checked to see if the list of
preferred WWPNs was in the list of available WWPNs.  This would only work
if all of the WWPNs were available on the storage host.  This resulted in
volumes not being able to be mounted when they should have been
available.

This fix changes the check of the preferred WWPNs to check each
item in the list until one is found.  The first one found is used
as the target WWPN.  If no match is found, the old default behavior
of selecting the first available WWPN is used.  I have added a
warning message for this case as it is quite possible that this
won't work in the user's environment as was the case that uncovered
this bug.

Note that this change is only relevant for systems that are not using
multipath as systems that use multipath don't choose one WWPN, they
just send the whole available list back.

Several jobs fails with [OSError] Cannot allocate memory,
but it is not clear why. Is  it caused by multiple run away process,
or just on process become fat.

Adding line to cleanup_host to save the final process list including
the memory usage.

During compute manager startup init_host is called. One
of the functions this carries out is to delete instance
data that doesn't belong to this host this function only
checks if the local instance belongs to the host or not.
It doesn't check the task_state. This could result in the
loss of all instance data if it occured at the wrong
point during live migration.

This change checks if the task_state of the instance to
be deleted is MIGRATING and if so it does not delete the
instance. Similarily for the task state RESIZE_MIGRATING.

This change adjust little about the unit test according to
actual code path in icehouse.

Since we use jquery-migrate, Horizon will work both with jquery older
than 1.10 and newer. We don't use any 1.10-specific features, so it's
fine to allow older jquery versions.

This lets us package Horizon both for Debian (with jquery 1.7.2) and
for Fedora (with jquery 1.10.2).

haproxy reload can lead to haproxy returning
