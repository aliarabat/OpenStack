True.  Additionally, it didn't really make sense to me anyway given

The auth_token middleware was marking a token invalid in the cache
on any otherwise-uncaught exception, not only when it has really
determined that the token is invalid. This will fix that by being
better about using the InvalidToken exception only when the token is
really invalid, and only marking invalid in the cache when that
exception occurs.

This fix uncovered a bug in the auth_token unit test
test_composite_auth_delay_invalid_service_and_user_tokens, so that has
been addressed as well. It was attempting to use ""invalid-user-token"",
which was not initialized, where it meant to use ""invalid-token"". This
was leading to a NoMockAddress exception. Prior to this fix, the code
turned all unexpected exceptions into InvalidToken exceptions, masking
this issue.

It also uncovered DeprecationWarnings raised in _identity.py for usage
of logging.warn rather than logging.warning in py34. That has also
been fixed. As above, prior to this fix those would have been turned
into InvalidToken exceptions (incorrectly).

This patch asserts the ""One file per thing"" best practice
for the storage services. It also removes the $$secureStorage
component, since it doesn't actually exist, or is a thing that
browsers actually do.

The behavior of the storage API has also been changed. Instead
of returning 'null' when a key is not found, it expects a return of
'undefined'. Unit tests to assert all edge cases have been added,
and the coverage threshold for the webclient has been raised.

This change reworks the tests for the openstack module so they actually
function. This change includes basic tests for the
openstack::{logging,logrotate,controller,compute} classes. Additionally
some minor lint issues have been addressed to fix errors that were
preventing the syntax checker from passing.

This change is necessary so we can properly test changes when we need to
replace or upgrade some of the module dependencies for the openstack
module.

This patch aims at creating Rally scale tests for VPNaaS.
It tests the full stack creation of VPNaaS -creating actual
networks/routers etc.,

(a)vpn_utils.py contains a set of standalone utility methods to
   create/delete networks, nova instances etc.,
(b)vpn_base.py holds the vpn specific functions to create, delete
   and verify vpn connectivity.
(c)test_vpn_connectivity.py holds the actual scenario.
(d)rally_config.yaml file is the input configuration file

To test this patch:
(1) Install devstack with rally plugin.
(2) Create the following folder structure.
    sudo mkdir /opt/rally
(3) Create a symlink to the plugins directory.
    cd /opt/rally
    sudo ln -s /opt/stack/neutron-vpnaas/rally-jobs/plugins
(4) Run the test
    rally task start <path-to-input-file>
    To see the debug logs,
    rally -vd taks start <path-to-input-file>

Note:
This patch also includes the commit ID cb5e1708 of vpn_utils.py

Rackspace puts neutron in the service catalog but it does not work (404s
the endpoint) While it's easy enough to try/except around network calls,
it's also a known fact and can be communicated clearly. Allow things
that want to short-circuit read the value from the config and react
accordingly.

Note: This is not a value going in to the defaults, because the fact
that this is happening at all is highly strange and hopefully something
that can be solved by collaborating on future iterations of DefCore.
However, communicating clearly that it's a known issue is helpful for a
class of users.

IPv6 support is detectable, so rather than having a user opt-in to it,
provide a flag that can be provided to tell it that detected IPv6

1.  Modules in oslo_service uses eventlet, but they are not monkey_patched.
    This patch add monkey_patch to all unittest code.
    The original unittest code does not really work, it muddles through.

2.  According to what Elena Ezhova said, there is a bug about patching os module on
    windows [1]. As a result, the monkey patch bypass os module on windows.

3.  subprocess module is not monkey_patched by default, we should use
    eventlet.green.subprocess explicitly.

4.  test_stop_immediately() does not work as expected, the reason it passes is because
    foo() never get a change to run, if foo get a change to run, the blocking version
    time.sleep() in it will block the main thread. We should give it a chance to run
    so that the test counts.

Occasionally a Purity host can be deleted out from underneath Cinder.
When this happens if cinder is attempting to disconnect a volume from
that host we should treat it as a ‘success’ since if the host is gone,
it is disconnected already (as far as Purity is concerned).

To prevent one cause of this, the disconnect method will now be locked
with the connect ones so that can’t delete a host we intend to re-use.

With the removal of ceilometer from devstack we need to update the
way in which tempest jobs are started for ceilometer: New jobs are used
to start tempest tests with the right backends and with the devstack
plugin in place. The 'integrated-gate' jobs are no longer used as
those do not start ceilometer so are not useful.

With this change we add the following jobs:

 gate-tempest-dsvm-ceilometer-mysql-neutron-full
 gate-tempest-dsvm-ceilometer-mysql-full
 gate-tempest-dsvm-ceilometer-postgresql-full

which effectively replace:

 gate-tempest-dsvm-full
 gate-tempest-dsvm-postgres-full
 gate-tempest-dsvm-neutron-full

The jobs are set up so that future expansion should not be too
terribly difficult.

Note: These have not been added as experimental because
ceilometer currently has no tempest coverage in the gate.

It's possible for a VM deploy to fail before the vfc mappings
have been created. If this happens the revert attempts to
remove the mappings, but find_vios_for_port_map will return
None because there aren't any mappings.

Also, instead of using find_vios_for_port_map which finds using

finds the vios based off of the WWPNs.

so that it is clearer as to which specs have been
approved (but not implemented) and which specs

Since specs that were approved, but not implemented in the same

We would like to continue to keep using one single job to run Puppet
unit tests, whatever branch we are running.

For history, Puppet modules have a specific matrix of Puppet versions
support:
 +------------------------------------------+
 |        Puppet versions support matrix    |
 +------------------------------------------+
 | puppet | icehouse | juno | kilo | master |
 +------------------------------------------+
 | 3.x    |   yes    | yes  | yes  | yes    |
 | 4.0    |   no     | no   | yes  | yes    |
 | latest |   no     | no   | no   | yes    |
 +------------------------------------------+

This patch aims to keep the logic we have in Zuul layout for regular
(that will be dropped in near future) which take care of branches & what
to run, but in Jenkins jobs itself by using ZUUL_BRANCH.

That way, we have one single experimental job able to detect what we
actually need to run and fail in consequence of a failing test for a
specific version.

This patch also adds debug messages at the end of the job so we can
easily know what is failing or not, regarding Puppet versions.

use v3. It also adds two new configuration options so swiftclient can

New configurable options:
 - glance_swift_store_auth_version
   This is the Keystone API auth version to use. The previous default
   was 2, but this patch changes it to 3.

 - glance_swift_store_user_domain
   This is the Domain ID for the user used to authenticate to Swift.

an empty character to finish the iteration. This is no longer the case

It's possible to create multiple security groups with the same name,
and then launching an instance will error with ""Error: Multiple

The solution is to use the group id instead of group name in the form.

This only works with Neutron, because Nova-Network not only requires the
groups to be passed by name, but also passes them by name internally in
several places.

There are several commonly used MuranoPL-specific yaql functions
that were extension methods (i.e. those that can be called as both as functions
(foo($x)) and as methods ($x.foo())) before Murano switched to yaql 1.0
(because this was the only option for yaql 0.2). To keep backward compatibility
they remain such after migration to 1.0 but only for MuranoPL/1.0 format.
The new approach was to make them pure functions and auto convert to
extension methods for MuranoPL/1.0. However due to error both original
and auto-generated versions of the same functions were placed in the same
yaql context. As a result when attempts to call them as a functions
(say id($this)) caused AmbiguousFunctionException to be thrown because
both function versions would satisfy this syntax.

There were early yields in the DHCP agent to handling skipping
lease setup for certain IPv6 addresses. However, the setup for
name resolution in _output_addn_hosts_file depends on the same
function so certain IPv6 addresses weren't getting name resolution.

This patch adjusts the function to return a flag indicating that
DHCP isn't required for the port so the callers setting up reservations
can skip based on that and the name resolution setup can continue
as normal.

they remain such after migration to 1.0 but only for MuranoPL/1.0 format.
The new approach was to make them pure functions and auto convert to

yaql context. As a result when attempts to call them as a functions

both function versions would satisfy this syntax.

This change adds alternative logic for handling package updates
on a pacemaker managed node.

""yum list updates"" is now run and this script exits early if
there are no packages to update.

If the pacemaker service is not running then the previous puppet
logic remains, so a package update is performed which excludes packages
managed by puppet, and a flag is set to indicate that puppet should
perform an ensure=>latest on all packages it manages.

However if the pacemaker service is running, the following occurs:
- pcs cluster stop is run for this node
- a full yum update is performed
- pcs cluster start is run for this node
- pcs status is run until the hostname for this node appears in the
  Online list

This means that puppet is not involved in the package update process when
the node is managed by pacemaker.

This change updates yum_update.sh so that we set set a boolean
output when ""managed"" packages should get updated. The
output is named 'update_managed_packages' and for the
puppet implementation it is wired up so that it
directly sets tripleo::packages::enable_upgrade to
control whether packages are updated.

It also modifies yum_update.sh to build a yum update excludes list for
packages managed by puppet. The exclude lists are being
generated via puppet-tripleo as well via the new 'write_package_names'
function that is now wired into all the role manifests.

This change does not actually trigger the puppet apply. The fix for
Related-Bug: #1463092 will be used to trigger the puppet run when the
hiera changes. As a minor tweak to this logic we append the
UpdateIdentifier to the config_identifier so that we ensure
puppet gets executed on an update where other (non-related)
hiera changes also occur.

This patch adds the variable 'pip_install_options' which is passed to the pip
install module as extra arguments in order to allow the use of options like
'--force-reinstall' when executing playbooks.

eg: openstack-ansible -e pip_install_options=""--force-reinstall"" \
        setup-openstack.yml

This is required due to constant upstream changes in dependencies which
result in python wheel version upgrades and downgrades between tagged
versions of openstack-ansible.

The intention is that this can be used whenever a deployer switches between
tags for both upgrades and downgrades.

The `test_trans_add` test in `manila.tests.test_hacking.HackingTestCase`
consistently failed on our CI system, which is based on Ubuntu 14.04.
Contrary, on my development machine running Fedora 22, all tests
succeeded. Whilst the test dispatches on Python version (`if six.PY2`)
to select which `hacking` errors are expected, at which line/column
pair, I noticed our CI system returned the expected values for Python 2,
not the Python 3 ones, which differ in column numbers only.

After verifying versions of dependencies, stepping through the code and
whatnot, the only difference left turned out to be the version of Python
being used: 3.4.2 on my workstation, 3.4.3 on our CI system. As a last
resort, I opened the Python 3.4 ChangeLog [1] and noticed a suspicious
entry::

    Issue #21295: Revert some changes (issue #16795) to AST line numbers
    and column offsets that constituted a regression.

Looking at those issues, it becomes clear this is the cause. Supposedly
the Python 3 specific expected values were created on a Python 3.4
version containing the original patch of #16795 [2], and this is also
what's running on the OpenStack CI system. Our CI system runs a build of
Python which contains the revert of #21295 [3].

This patch fixes the version-specific expected error calculation by not
simply dispatching on Python 2 or 3, but specifically limits the custom
version to 3.4.0 <= Python < 3.4.3.

This change will make it possible to map block devices to be used for
the Ceph OSDs filesystem or for its journal. It defaults to store
objects in /srv/data as it was before but it allows for usage of
non-homogeneus hardware, where the name and number of block devices is
not the same across all the Ceph storage nodes.

Mapping can be passed via the NodeDataLookup parameter in the
per_node.yml.

Example would be

```
resource_registry:
  OS::TripleO::CephStorageExtraConfigPre: puppet/extraconfig/pre_deploy/per_node.yaml

parameter_defaults:
  NodeDataLookup: | {""SYSTEMUUID"": {""ceph::osds : {""/dev/sdc"": """"}}}
```

This will ensure Ceph OSD will be created on /dev/sdc on the node that
output of $(dmidecode --s system-uuid) matches SYSTEMUUID.

When handling create_share_from_snapshot with glusterfs
volume layout, we do a snapshot clone gluster operation
that gives us a new volume (which will be used to back
the new share). 'snapshot clone' does not start the
resultant volume, we have explicitly start it from Manila.
So far the volume layout code did not bother about it,
rather the 'vol start' was called from glusterfs-native
driver. That however broke all other volume layout based
configs (ie. glusterfs driver with vol layout).

Fix this now by doing the 'vol start' call in the vol
layout code.

This patch adds the variable 'pip_install_options' which is passed to the pip
install module as extra arguments in order to allow the use of options like
'--force-reinstall' when executing playbooks.

eg: openstack-ansible -e pip_install_options=""--force-reinstall"" \

This is required due to constant upstream changes in dependencies which
result in python wheel version upgrades and downgrades between tagged
versions of openstack-ansible.

The intention is that this can be used whenever a deployer switches between
tags for both upgrades and downgrades.

This contains the create, delete, update, show, and list client APIs for
the new VPN endpoint group API.

The API syntax is:

vpn-endpoint-group-create [--name name] [--description desc] \
    --type {subnet|cidr|vlan} --value <value1> [--value <value2>...]

vpn-endpoint-group-delete <name-or-uuid>

vpn-endpoint-group-show <name-or-uuid>

vpn-endpoint-group-update <name-or-uuid> [--name name] [--description desc]

vpn-endpoint-group-list

Notes:

Using prefix ""vpn-"" on commands, so that there is no conflict with other
neutron commands.

Note: Using --type and --value, instead of --endpoint_type and --endpoint,
which are already used (and must be globally unique). For example, if latter
re used, see error ""Must specify new values to update endpoint_group"".

The --value may be repeated multiple times, as a list of endpoints can be
added to a group. There must be at least one.

For --type=subnet, the user may enter the name or UUID of subnet, which
must already exist. Client will translate names to UUIDs.

As shown, the endpoints cannot be modified. A new endpoint group must be
formed, and then can be used by VPN (once support is in place).

When updating, either name or description must be provided (otherwise
there is nothing to update).

Added unit tests for the new API.

Currently, in the Instance.save method, if an ObjectField is dirty,
it will be updated in the db before the instance record is updated
(separate transaction). If the instance does not have a row, the
foreign key constraint fails and DBReferenceError is raised from
oslo.db. This scenario can happen in cells if an instance delete
request comes in before it's scheduled, during the broadcast to
delete in all cells. This is expected and InstanceNotFound is
caught and handled.

This change catches DBReferenceError and raises InstanceNotFound.

Conflicts:

NOTE(mriedem): The test conflict is because we don't have commit

not needed for this bug fix.

A few things here: 1) we need to check if the client class even
has a 'resource_class', in the case of glanceclient, it does not.

2) If everything fails we should print a better error message,
rather than a ""find"" failed, since some clients don't support find.

This patch adds a SSL/TLS listener to RabbitMQ without disrupting the existing
plaintext TCP listener.  Various services that use RabbitMQ will have the
option to encrypt messaging traffic with this change.  Documentation is
included for this change.

By default, it will create a self-signed certificate for the user, but users
have the option to specify their own existing certificates as well.

This makes it easier to bring RabbitMQ (and the services which talk to it)
into compliance with PCI DSS 3.1's Requirement 2.2.3.

In addition, this change is recommended within the OpenStack Security Guide.

`_parse_block_device_mapping` method was design to support both
bdm v1 and v2. The implementation is based on the fact that API side
ignores unknown/incorrect parameters, so `_parse_block_device_mapping` compose
equal parameter for bdm v1 and bdm v2. Since Nova V2.1 contains schema checks,
such implementation stoped working.
Despite the fact that novaclient.v2.servers contains separate logic for bdm v2,
we can make `_parse_block_device_mapping` works only with legacy bdm and
in future patches make it works for both bdm v1 and bdm v2.

The 'git-repo-manifests' project will hold manifest files which can be
used with the git-repo program to clone multiple projects at once.

git-repo also known as repo is developed hand-in-hand with Gerrit by
Google.  https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo

Manifest files are XML documents used to specify multiple git
repositories that are associated with each other. This will allow being
able to pull down all git repositories associated with a master project. For
example the Ironic project has multiple git repositories associated with
it. For example:
    - openstack/bifrost
    - openstack/coreos-image-builder
    - openstack/ironic
    - openstack/ironic-inspector
    - openstack/ironic-lib
    - openstack/ironic-python-agent
    - openstack/ironic-specs
    - openstack/ironic-webclient
    - openstack/python-dracclient
    - openstack/python-ironic-inspector-client
    - openstack/python-ironicclient

With a correct manifest file and git-repo installed could do the
following to check out all the repositories:
 $ repo init -u https://review.openstack.org/openstack/git-repo-manifests -m ironic
 $ repo sync -c

This will be purely optional for usage by developers.

While testing the cDOT driver at high concurrency (12), we observed a few
occasional errors that were difficult to explain until we noticed that
some APIs were being sent to the wrong vserver. Root cause is that the
protocol helpers are cached and reused despite being stateful. There is
virtually no performance benefit to caching the helper classes, so the
simplest fix is to stop caching them.

This will enable update-preview to see if the resource will be replaced

Note: This change will result in fewer cases where an update to the
existing resource is allowed. However, this is currently the best
solution, given that:

1) It will result in an accurate update-preview operation,
2) Rebuilding an AlarmDefinition resource shouldn't take long, and
3) Implementing a proper _needs_update() would require copying
   expression parsing logic from Monasca into Heat.

This feature is already implemented, but not enabled because it
has strange behavior when the image list is filtered by removing aki

The pagination for images view should be enabled since the filtering
image code was removed in: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/59935/

Because the ImagesTable is the only one being incorporated into the
images view, there is no need to include table.name attribute into

between).
