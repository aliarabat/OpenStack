In db API when we process filters, we didn't
use deepcopy. In cases of ""tags"" and ""not-tags""
we used pop to get the first tag, filtered out
results, and then joined with other tags for
later filtering. When we did pop(), the original
value was deleted, the key ""tags""/""not-tags"" remains.

In the cell scenario, both single cell(we will
query cell0 and the other cell) and multicell,
as we have to query all the cells in a loop and
the tags list in the filter will keep popping,
this will lead to either a HTTP 500 error(popping
from an empty list) or incorrect result(when
number of tags in the list is larger than cell
number, no HTTP 500 will show, but the filter
results for each cell will be different as
each loop will pop one tag).

Conflicts:
      nova/tests/functional/regressions/test_bug_1682693.py

NOTE(mriedem): The conflict on the functional regression test
is due to I65bdfadd406368775c794ee4d8a16302a8a134bc not being
backported to Newton. That was not backported simply because it
relies on too many fixtures to stub out a real cells environment
that trying to get it to work in Newton is not worth it. This
fix is still unit tested which is sufficient.

Starting from version 1.3.5, Libvirt allows to set a vlan tag for macvtap
passthrough mode on SR-IOV VFs. Libvirt also removes any vlan tags that
has been set externally, by the ip link command.

In order to support the older libvirt versions, this code will make
the behaviour backward compatible by checking the libvirt version.
This can be completely removed once the minimum libvirt version will increase.

NOTE(mriedem): There is a slight modification in the test in Newton
because 6a6457b5a6563b6cb4bf7673b00773d8208f5900 is not in Newton.

The systemd unit 'TimeoutSec' value which controls the time
between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived
sessions to drain while preventing new ones from starting
before a restart or a stop.

The 'RestartSec' value which controls the time between the
service stop and start when restarting has been reduced from
150 seconds to 2 seconds to make the restart happen faster.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides
variables which use the config_template task to change template
defaults.

away from the system slice allowing us to better optimise resource

Tools like ``systemd-cgtop`` and ``systemd-cgls`` will now give us
insight into specific processes, process groups, and resouce consumption
in ways that we've not had access to before. To enable some of this reporting
the accounting options have been added to the [Service] section of the unit

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a
known bug [1] in Ansible's apt module which does not
update the cache properly if the cache update and the
install are combined in a single task.

The systemd unit 'TimeoutSec' value which controls the time
between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived
sessions to drain while preventing new ones from starting
before a restart or a stop.

The 'RestartSec' value which controls the time between the
service stop and start when restarting has been reduced from
150 seconds to 2 seconds to make the restart happen faster.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides
variables which use the config_template task to change template
defaults.

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a
known bug [1] in Ansible's apt module which does not
update the cache properly if the cache update and the
install are combined in a single task.

It is possible that _update_port_binding_for_instance() is called
without a migration object, such as when a user unshelves an instance.

If the instance has a port(s) with a PCI device binding, the current
logic extracts a pci mapping from old to new devices from the migration
object and migration context.  If a 'new' device is not found in the
PCI mapping, an exception is thrown.

In the case of an unshelve, there is no migration object (or migration
context), and as such we have an empty pci mapping.

This fix will only check for a new device if we have a migration object.

The systemd unit 'TimeoutSec' value which controls the time
between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived
sessions to drain while preventing new ones from starting
before a restart or a stop.

The 'RestartSec' value which controls the time between the
service stop and start when restarting has been reduced from
150 seconds to 2 seconds to make the restart happen faster.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides
variables which use the config_template task to change template
defaults.

When adding multiple subnets on a single network the
DHCP agent will set dhcp-options to advertise
""on-link""/""same-segment"" classless static routes to
all the subnets. This change adds a new Network model
attribute, 'onlink_subnet_routes', that allows the
operator to disable the creation of the ""on-link""
routes. Default value is True.

According to RFC 3442 configuring the DHCP server to
specify these routes is optional.

 Local Subnet Routes

     In some cases more than one IP subnet may be configured on a link.
     In such cases, a host whose IP address is in one IP subnet in the
     link could communicate directly with a host whose IP address is in a
     different IP subnet on the same link. In cases where a client is
     being assigned an IP address on an IP subnet on such a link, for each
     IP subnet in the link other than the IP subnet on which the client
     has been assigned the DHCP server MAY be configured to specify a
     router IP address of 0.0.0.0.

Tools like ``systemd-cgtop`` and ``systemd-cgls`` will now give us
insight into specific processes, process groups, and resouce consumption
in ways that we've not had access to before. To enable some of this reporting
the accounting options have been added to the [Service] section of the unit

The callback modules have been available in neutron-lib since commit [1]
and are ready for consumption.

As the callback registry is implemented with a singleton manager
instance, sync complications can arise ensuring all consumers switch to
lib's implementation at the same time. Therefore this consumption has
been broken down:
1) Shim neutron's callbacks using lib's callback system and remove
existing neutron internals related to callbacks (devref, UTs, etc.).
2) Switch all neutron's callback imports over to neutron-lib's.
3) Have all sub-projects using callbacks move their imports over to use
neutron-lib's callbacks implementation.
4) Remove the callback shims in neutron-lib once sub-projects are moved
over to lib's callbacks.
5) Follow-on patches moving our existing uses of callbacks to the new
event payload model provided by neutron-lib.callback.events

This patch implements #1 from above, shimming neutron's callbacks and
removing devref + UTs. Rather than shimming using debtcollector, this
patch leaves callback constants as-is, and simply references the lib
class/function in its respective neutron callback module. This allows
consumers to test callback types without changing code. For example,
an except block block like that below continues to work even though
the raised exception now lives in lib::

try:
     neutron_cb_registry.notify(...)
except neutron_cb_exceptions.CallbackFailure:
     handle_exception()

In addition this patch contains minor UT updates to support the shim
approach.

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a
known bug [1] in Ansible's apt module which does not
update the cache properly if the cache update and the
install are combined in a single task.

Commit 15ed2ec42ce5 (""bindep.txt: Use RedHat and SUSE platforms in
bindep.txt"") added support for the new 'redhat' and 'suse' families
in bindep. However, this broke the SUSE case because the ndg-httpsclient
package name is different between RedHat and SUSE so we need to use
separate packages for these families.

resetting the state of an instance/cluster can be dangerous.
Any user should still be able to force delete an instance/cluster.

Since, force delete calls the reset status command and then the

dib is now going to have to be installed explicitly for us to actually
run the gate. the old method of just cloning the repo won't work with
dib v2.

There are other ways to accomplish this but I'm choosing this approach
knowing that it isn't ideal. First, what's the downside? This means
that dib gets installed wherever trove control plane is installed. Is
that necessary, NO. Is it the end of the world, NO.

What are the options?

- do what Octavia did and have a second requirements.txt in a folder
  called diskimage-create. Would this work, yes but we don't have such
  a mechanism right now and nothing would keep this requirements.txt
  file in sync with g-r that I know of.

- hardcode the pip install command somewhere in the devstack
  plugin. yes, this would work but this would also have no ability to
  sync with g-r.

So, while the solution proposed here isn't ideal, it strikes me as not
bad, and much less risk than the other two options.

We also need to figure out where the elements are and fix the path for
disk-image-create.

Some pep8 failures appears to have crept in as well, those are
addressed.

The CONTENT_LENGTH environ can be present, but empty, which returns
None, and causes a ValueError when attempting to use .int().

This patch removes the setting of CONTENT_LENGTH to an integer, but
instead ensures that if CONTENT_LENGTH is not empty it is an integer, to
prevent a situation where a bogus ""CONTENT_LENGTH"" header is specified.

Additionally, as the CONTENT_TYPE environ can similarly be present but
empty, we should .get() it in a similar fashion to ensure it isn't
present but None when CONTENT_LENGTH is specified.

When you execute nova-manage commands, oslo logs to the following
location (file name is dynamically created based on command name).

Because puppet-nova is executing these commands as root,
nova-manage.log is owned by root:root, preventing the 'nova-manage
db archive_deleted_rows' entry in nova's crontab from executing.

    Permission denied: '/var/log/nova/nova-manage.log'

This log file is also an outlier, as all other log files in
/var/log/nova/ are owned by nova:nova.

Follow-up patches will need to chown this log file for the upgrade
case. It might also make sense to just explicitly touch this file
in the install case too since this bug keeps coming back (here are
a few of them).

By registering functions directly we cut off the dependency of the
""resource extend"" functions on the plugin. This is a step towards
the goal of removing the CommonDbMixin mixin class.

Also, we register all ""resource extend"" functions at plugin create
(in __new__) instead of in the class definition (which caused the
hooks to be registered on import). This ensures the ""resource
extend"" functions are only registered for the plugins/mixins that
are actually used.

Note that decorators are used to register ""resource extend"" methods,
similar to the callback receiver decorators.

This commit removes the skip condition with flavor_ref and
flavor_ref_alt when the resize feature is enable. Because when
resize feature is enable, the flavor_ref and flavor_ref_alt should be
set properly, otherwise, it is a misconfiguration. So we should fail
but not skip at the situation.

1. What is the problem?
As discussed in the spec[1], we lack support of one deployment
scenario that each OpenStack cloud provides external network
for north-south traffic and at the same time east-west networking
of tenant networks between OpenStack clouds are also enabled.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
Implement a new layer-3 networking model discussed in the spec[1].

3. What features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
to realize the solution?
Xmanager is modified to properly configure router interface, router
extra routes and subnet host routes for the new model.

use dict.items instead, as it will return

use the hostname to get node address through cloud provider. But when
not using openstack cloud provide, k8s can not get node address if
--hostname-override is set to be hostname rather than IP.

Nova offers a ""serial console"" as an alternative to graphical consoles
like VNC/SPICE/RDP. This is useful for platforms which don't have
graphical consoles, for example the ""IBM system z"" platform.

This change introduces a test which ensures that the interaction with
the serial console is possible before and after a live-migration.
As the unified remote console API is available since microversion 2.6,
I use this as a base for the tests. This made id necessary to update
the schemas.

This change introduces a config option to enable new test cases for
the serial console.
A Nova change (see I7af395a867e0657c26fa064d2b0134345cd96814),
which uses the hook for live-migration testing, will use the config
option of this change to alter the testing system on the fly to
enable the testing of the serial console.

Python Argparse supports the 'append' action [1] which is super handy to allow
a user to repeat several times the same argument, each time with different
values.

This doesn't work with occ that tries to ""fix argv"" but raises this error:

os_client_config.exceptions.OpenStackConfigException: The following options
were given: '--foo,--foo' which contain duplicates except that one has _
and one has -. There is no sane way for us to know what you're doing.
Remove the duplicate option and try again

This patch tweak the _fix_argv() function so that it doesn't explode
if the duplicate option has no '_' not '-' in its name.

When the percona-cluster charm sets an access-network but the default
unit-get address is not on that network extra shared-db relations get
executed. This is specifically a problem when running upgrades and
trying to avoid API downtime.

The root cause is that the access-network is not checked until the
SharedDBContext is consulted. But then db_joined function will
change it back to the wrong ip on subsequent runs.

This change adds a check for access-network on the relation during the
db_joined function and pushes IP selection off to get_relation_ip.

Charm helpers sync to pull in changes to get_relation_ip.

Currently os-net_config will map nics from a user-supplied mapping file
only if the nic is active (operstate = up).  This can cause problems
if a nic is in a bond and one of the bond's nics has no carrier.
This fix will map the nic from the mapping file if the nic is defined
on the system, regardless of the operstate status.

The fix implements a new function to return a list of available nics
(no check of operstate) for use if a mapping file is supplied.  The
list of active nics must still be used in the default case when
numbering nics (no mapping file supplied).  There is also some
cleanup to check if a user-supplied mac is in the mapping file before
attempting to convert the mac to a nic.

Many attribute in the request schema are defined with
allowed enum values. But schema does not specify those
enum as string type.

enum in json schema is defined in such a way that it
allows any type not just string so defining each enum type
as string explicitly makes schema more readable and consistent
with other API schema.

Note- this does not change any behavior or does not fix any issue.
This is just for consistency with other schema definition and readability.

The cause for that fix is that pre-fix approach works with
rhel root but not rhel non root.

The veth_pair name was partially configurable, however eth0's
veth pair naming scheme was hard coded.

This change accomplishes:
- veth pair prefix templating is now consistent across all interfaces
  generated by the role.
- no change is made to the default configuration of veth pair naming,
  it only allows more reusability of the role by allowing the veth
  pair naming to be configured by the role's consumers.
- eth0 veth pair naming scheme can be configured just as other
  interfaces could be before.

This patch add '/servers' related routes by a plain list, instead
of using stevedore. After all the Nova API endpoints moves to
the plain routes list, the usage of stevedore for loading the API
will be removed from Nova.

To remove the servers extension from stevedore, all the extensions
which depend on servers needs to be removed together. Those
extensions are about the servers API response extension and the action
extension.

Also note that the original 'ProjectMapper' use the 'routes.Mapper.resource'
to create a set of routes for a resource which comform to the Atom
publishing protocol. It includes some of URL mappings we didn't document
before. This patch will remove those URL mappings, also remove the
corresponding URL mappings for 'os-volumes_boot' endpoint. For the detail,
please reference:

We should only deploy it in the nodes containing the keystone service

Currently, a validation error is thrown if we find any PCI device
records which have not populated the parent_addr column on a nova
upgrade. However, the only PCI records for which a parent_addr
makes sense for are those with a device type of 'type-VF' (ie. an
SRIOV virtual function).  PCI records with a device type of 'type-PF'
or 'type-PCI' will not have a parent_addr.  If any of those records
are present on upgrade, the validation will fail.

This change checks that the device type of the PCI record is
'type-VF' when making sure the parent_addr has been correctly
populated

This patch rehomes the extra_dhcp_opt extension
from neutron.extensions into the API definitions
within neutron-lib. As part of the rehome some
refactoring is done:
- The DHCP opt exceptions are removed; one is never used [1]
and the other extends InvalidInput and is only used in the
validator [2] and can be replaced by a vanilla InvalidInput
exception.
- The validator is refactored and moved into validators.
- The 'id' EXTRA_DHCP_OPT_KEY_SPECS is removed as its
unused.
- The validator in lib is registered as type
'type:list_of_extra_dhcp_options' which is slightly
different than the original type. This is intentional to
ensure the rehome/consume goes smoothly and the
same validator is not registered multiple times.

UTs + release note also included.

In addition a bugfix is included that's required for the validator
herein. The problem is that if data is passed into
_validate_list_of_items that is a list of dicts, a TypeError is
raised because dicts are unhashable.

This api-def is used in stadium sub-projects such as
networking-ovn and is therefore a candidate for
rehoming.

The description of scope parameter in the API docs is inconsistent for
scoped and explicit unscoped authorization. It doesn't explain clearly
when the parameter should be set to keyword 'unscoped' (explicit
unscoped authorization) and when to include ID/name of the project/
domain (scoped authorization). This patch covers the required update
for the scope parameter by introducing separate descriptions for the
above mentioned cases.

For explicit unscoped authorization, the keystone server specifies
scope value as 'unscoped' whereas in some old versions of keystoneauth
the value is {'unscoped': {}}. Added a comment to keystone/auth/schema.py
to make sure the type of scope parameter is object and not string, so
that it is consistent with older versions too.

In v3 API docs the case for token authentication with explicit unscoped
authorization is missing. Added documentation and request example for
that case.

no longer made sense. I think it was an incomplete

Using ansible_user_id to determine the primary group for a user implies
that such a group exists in the first place. Unfortunately this is not
always the case. For example, openSUSE does not create a new group for
every user but places all of them in the 'users' group. As such, avoid
using ansible_user_id and switch to ansible_user_gid which provides a
numeric value for the user's primary group.

This change adds an `include` statement to bring in the extra
functionality available from the existing puppet-ssh module in
already available in RDO.

By using puppet-ssh it provides a framework to allow the passing in of
server options using just hiera values under ssh::server_options.
For example, sshd_config banner can now be passed a server option, as
well as all the new parameters outlined in the launchpad issue that
the patch references for Closing. For this reason, the former augeas
setting for `Banner /etc/issue` is now managed by the main puppet-ssh
module instead.

The change also allows population of MOTD text to `/etc/motd` as
well as `issue.net`.

$bannertext is refactored in accordance with patch [1]

Currently you can only provide one IP address for the Ironic conductor
and conductor TFTP service to use. This doesn't work if you scale out
your conductors because every conductor needs a different address. This
patch allows the operator to provide a CIDR in cloud.yaml and the
ironic-conductor service will pick the IP address the host has in that
network.

The Horizon spinner was using a spinner generated and animated
entirely out of JavaScript. Since CSS3 provides animates and we have
access to icon fonts, doing everything with JavaScript is not
necessary and actually taxing on the browser. Plus, all of the
spinner options were being passed in and around with JavaScript,
including the colors.  This makes it supremely difficult to use the
theme to style the spinner.

The new spinner is just defined by a handful of templates now. There
are two clientside templates to support Legacy Horizon, and one
template in the Angular to support spinners going forward.  Legacy
Horizon had two forms of spinners, so it was broken up. Angular as
not yet made use of the inline spinner, but should follow the same
markup when it is made.

There are two types of spinners, inline spinners (those shown when a
dynamic tab content is loading) and modal spinners (various other
places).  These are consistent with each other for the 'default'
experience, but their experience can be entirely customized separate
from each other.  'material' has been augmented with loaders defined
within their design spec to show the power of this new feature.

horizon.templates.js was augmented with this refactor to support only
having to compile one tempalte at a time (instead of all of them) and
caching that template so that all of them can be recompiled later.
Also, horizon.loader.js was added to house template compilation code
that was repeated in several locations.

To test overwriting page modal spinner and inline-modal spinner
examples, please follow the instructions in _loading_inline_exmaple.html,
_loading_modal_example.html under
openstack_dashboard/themes/material/templates/horizon/client_side
