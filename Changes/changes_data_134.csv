This commit adds a new configuration option `default_branch`, which is
used to specify the default/base branch a repository is using.
Previously reno assumed the default branch was always named 'master'
which causes commands such as 'reno lint' to fail when it is run on a
repository that uses a different default branch name such as 'main'.
This config option gives users an option to specify which branch should
be used for cases like that.

TLS client verification used to be accidentally disabled in libvirt.
This was fixed in libvirt-6.10.0-1.
Which means, once you're using libvirt-6.10.0-1 or higher, a client
certificate is mandatory during live migration with TLS.

If we simply create the client certificate, this will fix live-migration
of newly created instance but will not fix already created instances.

This change will allow us to keep client certificate validation disabled
during the train release cycle and re-enable it from Wallaby and onward.

As stated in the official ansible docs[0]:

When running fetch with become, the slurp module will also
be used to fetch the contents of the file for determining
the remote checksum. This effectively doubles the transfer
size, and depending on the file size can consume all available
memory on the remote or local hosts causing a MemoryError.
Due to this it is advisable to run this module without become
whenever possible.

This is mostly problematic when transfering big files and the
/var/lib/mysql folder tends to be big in long deployments.

This patch removes the become from the fetch task and changes
the archive permissions before the fetch in order to make it
possible. To cover this functionality a new test is added
huge_file which creates a 10G file in the source container,
as well as updates some molecule specific parameters which
were outdated.

TLS client verification used to be accidentally disabled in libvirt.
This was fixed in libvirt-6.10.0-1.
Which means, once you're using libvirt-6.10.0-1 or higher, a client
certificate is mandatory during live migration with TLS.

If we simply create the client certificate, this will fix live-migration
of newly created instance but will not fix already created instances.

This change will allow us to keep client certificate validation disabled
during the train release cycle and re-enable it from Wallaby and onward.

TLS client verification used to be accidentally disabled in libvirt.
This was fixed in libvirt-6.10.0-1.
Which means, once you're using libvirt-6.10.0-1 or higher, a client
certificate is mandatory during live migration with TLS.

If we simply create the client certificate, this will fix live-migration
of newly created instance but will not fix already created instances.

This change will allow us to keep client certificate validation disabled

Keystone's update_user() method in the SQL driver processes a lot of
information about how to update users. This includes evaluating password
logic and authentication attempts for PSI-DSS. This logic is evaluated
after keystone pulls the user record from SQL and before it exits the
context manager, which performs the write.

When multiple clients are all updating the same user reference, it's
more likely they will see an HTTP 500 because of race conditions exiting
the context manager. The HTTP 500 is due to stale data when updating
password expiration for old passwords, which happens when setting a new
password for a user.

This commit attempts to handle that case more gracefully than throwing a
500 by detecting StaleDataErrors from sqlalchemy and retrying.  The
identity sql backend will retry the request for clients that have
stale data change from underneath them.

And we could make the update the ansible-module to support both the list/dict stucture and just an IP. I guess the list/dict structure was put there because it mirrors neutron, less data transformation hassles.\n\nI wonder if allowing a boolean flag to enable/disable use of neutron would make sense, to address your desire to just specify anything.\nSomething like:\n  RedisVirtualFixedIPs: [{\'ip_address\':\'1.2.3.4\', \'use_neutron\': false}]\n\nwdyt?

I think it needs to be decoupled so that Heat never has to talk to the Neutron API.\n\nYeah, I was kind of hoping we could hack it with a custom heat resource that would work for the create only mode of ephemeral Heat, so that users are\'nt overwhelmed with another UX change. But I understand from Rabi\'s feedback on that patch that ephemeral Heat won\'t be able to talk to anything keystone, neutron etc. So, yes I\'ll work out a way for the other VIPs as well.'}, {'account_id': 6469, 'date': '2021-03-08 22:02:39.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1\n\n(1 comment)'}, {'account_id': 24245, 'date': '2021-03-08 22:06:03.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 4: Workflow-1\n\n(1 comment)'}, {'account_id': 24245, 'date': '2021-03-11 00:34:32.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 5.'}, {'account_id': 24245, 'date': '2021-03-11 00:44:52.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 6.'}, {'account_id': 24245, 'date': '2021-03-16 20:41:47.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 7.'}, {'account_id': 24245, 'date': '2021-03-17 08:53:24.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7: Workflow-1\n\nCI error, depends-on need fixing - https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tripleo-ansible/+/779883\n\n2021-03-16 22:23:43.536675 | fa163e6c-8a2e-3ef9-7ab5-0000000000eb |      FATAL | create ovn_dbs virtual ip | undercloud | error={""changed"": false, ""error"": ""Auth plugin requires parameters which were not given: auth_url"", ""msg"": ""ERROR: Failed creating service virtual IP!

With this change a Heat resource is no longer used to
create an undercloud neutron API port resource for the
redis and ovn_dbs service virtual IPs. Instead an
external deploy task at step 0 in the individual service
template uses the ""tripleo_service_vip"" ansible module
to mange a neutron API port resource for each service.

The interfaces to control the IP address and service
network (RedisVirtualFixedIPs, OVNDBsVirtualFixedIPs
and ServiceNetMap) remains the same.

It is also possible to include the 'use_neutron' boolean
in the FixedIPs parameter to instruct the ansible module
not to create a neutron API resource, and simply ""echo""
the ip_address given in the FixedIPs parameter. For
example:
  RedisVirtualFixedIPs:
    - ip_address: 1.0.0.5
      use_neutron: false

Alternatively the fixed-ips can be set using the
'ServiceVips' parameter, like this:

 ServiceVips:
   redis: 1.0.0.5
   ovs_dbs: 1.0.0.6

NOTE: If the neutron service is not available the
      tripleo_service_vip ansible module will ""echo""
      the IP provided in %service%VirtualFixedIPs.

Now that we have object audit watchers, let's have the ability to create
database audit watcher. That is account and container watchers.

Instead of a see_object, db watchers have a see_broker(broker).

There is also a very experimental bucket inventory container watcher
that by defaults puts the inventory in an object called .inventory in
the said container. On sharded containers this will be an SLO (once I
get it working). This inventory is just a json-ifyed version of the
object table.

The multipart document handling in the proxy is consumed via iteration,
but the error handling code is not consistent with how it applies
conversions of IO errors/timeouts and retry failures to StopIteration.

maintain I've added comments and additional tests as well as tightening
up StopIteration exception handling.

Manila's CephFS driver that we're testing
in scenario004 started supporting
snapshots and snapshot cloning, and our
tempest opts are incompatible.

Since tempestconf has a way to detect
the right options, lets stop overriding

There have been problems with centos7 lately with py2/py3.
Ansible's pip module used python2 instead of python3 for
creating virtual venv which lead to dependency issues with
infrared which should be installed only by py3.

This changes also bumps the linters, removing yamllint which is now
included in ansible-lint.

has broken the nagios user creation due to not setting the password.

This patch creates the nagios user and passord at the same time.  The
updating of the password is only done if the account already exists.

The change also corrects the nagios password store in leader-settings to
the 'mysql-nagios.passwd' key instead of 'nagios-password'.  This was an
unfortuante error when the nagios change password was introduced.  The
charm detects if the 'nagios-password' key is used on charm-upgrade and
moves it to 'mysql-nagios.passwd'.  This enables the key to work with
the standard MySQLHelper functions.

Finally, the ALTER command (on percona) doesn't update non-InnoDB tables
and thus needs to be run for each unit when the nagios password is
changed via the action.  The changes in percona_utils.py enable this to
happen.

Whilst the change looks large it ONLY affects the nagios password parts
of the charm.

The related bug is a tracking bug to serve as a reminder to fix this in
charm-helpers and this charm (i.e. make the charm-helpers code work to
change a password for any user other than root, and then enable this
charm to use that code).

In order to check how the ""nftables"" binaries work with Neutron, two
new jobs have been added to the periodic queue:
- neutron-tempest-plugin-scenario-linuxbridge-nftables

do, so perhaps we can deprecate this in the future. For now though,
simply document the thing. While we're here, we make some additional
related changes:

TLS client verification used to be accidentally disabled in libvirt.
This was fixed in libvirt-6.10.0-1.
Which means, once you're using libvirt-6.10.0-1 or higher, a client
certificate is mandatory during live migration with TLS.

If we simply create the client certificate, this will fix live-migration
of newly created instance but will not fix already created instances.

This change will allow us to keep client certificate validation disabled
during the train release cycle and re-enable it from Wallaby and onward.

If you enable zun docker config, it ends up in globals.yml used by the seed. The specific failure is that the cluster-store config option is used on the seed, but contains no etcd hosts, causing docker to fail to start.\n\nMore generally, we should only apply docker config for zun where it is required, i.e. on zun-compute and zun-cni-daemon hosts.""}, {'account_id': 14826, 'date': '2021-02-03 12:34:40.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 1:\n\nTested that this fixes the kayobe issue in https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/kayobe/+/773857'}, {'account_id': 30491, 'date': '2021-02-03 15:50:36.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2\n\nI am sold then'}, {'account_id': 14826, 'date': '2021-04-21 09:18:58.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 2.'}, {'account_id': 14826, 'date': '2021-04-21 10:42:57.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 3: Published edit on patch set 2.'}, {'account_id': 30491, 'date': '2021-04-21 11:37:18.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2 Review-Priority+1\n\nbugfix to release'}, {'account_id': 22629, 'date': '2021-04-21 11:39:22.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2 Workflow+1'}]","[{'created': '2021-02-03 09:18:44.000000000', 'message': 'Apply Zun configuration for Docker based on inventory\n\nIf docker_configure_for_zun is set to true, then Zun-specific\nconfiguration for Docker is applied to all nodes.

If docker_configure_for_zun is set to true, then Zun-specific
configuration for Docker is applied to all nodes. It should only be
applied based on the relevant inventory groups. In some cases this can
cause Docker to fail to start. See

This change applies the configuration based on the zun-compute and
zun-cni-daemon groups. It also modifies the expression to not assume
that these groups exist in the inventory.

This patch removes reference to TripleO packages.

It also brings a better testing coverage through Molecule.

This patch also refactors the module itself, so it now process
the packages in one go, and reports results to ansible.

Futhermore, validation will now check for appropriate package
arhchitecture, instead of assuming they are all the same.

Validation now also determines the package manager itself,
assuming it isn't provided one by ansible.
Default fact gathering is thus no longer needed,
potentially saving storage and improving performance.

We are seeing an error raised by older Neutron's

 400: Client Error for url: <cloud>/v2.0/security-group-rules,

This field was added unconditionally with
I50374c339ab7685a6e74f25f9521b8810c532e13 but, per above, appears to
cause problems for older Neutron instances.

To work around this, remove the argument from the body when blank by
overriding the _prepare_request function of SecurityGroupRule.

Two tests where this are used are updated; one checks the body is not
sent when None and the other is modified to send a
remote_address_group_id value to validate the other path.

TLS client verification used to be accidentally disabled in libvirt.

certificate is mandatory during live migration with TLS.

During the VM booting process Nova asks Neutron for the security groups
of the project. If there are no any fields specified, Neutron will
prepare list of security groups with all fields, including rules.
In case if project got many SGs, it may take long time as rules needs to
be loaded separately for each SG on Neutron's side.

During booting of the VM, Nova really needs only ""id"" and ""name"" of the
security groups so this patch limits request to only those 2 fields.

This lazy loading of the SG rules was introduced in Neutron in [1] and
[2].

Pylint raises E1120 on all many of our migrations because the insert
call is missing the dml parameter:

  cinder/db/sqlalchemy/migrate_repo/versions/123_cinder_init.py:870:9:
  E1120: No value for argument 'dml' in method call

The dml parameter is automatically added by sqlalchemy using a
decorator, like this:

    @util.dependencies(""sqlalchemy.sql.dml"")
    def insert(self, dml, values=None, inline=False, **kwargs):

This patch adds the decorator to the pyling configured
signature-mutators to remove these errors from incorrectly showing.

Router_info class and metadata agent's driver are using same
instance of the iptables manager class and it could happend that
sometimes e.g. nat rule which packets send to 169.254.169.254:80
redirects to the port 9697 so haproxy can process them, can be missed as
they will be overwritten by the Router_info class manipulating other
rules in the same 'nat' rules list.

This patch fixed that by adding lock for methods which are changing
rules in iptables_manager's nat table in both router_info and
the metadata agent's driver.

Currently if the baremetal boot mode is unknown and the driver doesn't
support setting the boot mode then the error is logged and deployment
continues.

However if the BMC doesn't support getting or setting the boot mode
then setting the boot mode raises an error which results in the deploy
failing. This is the case for HPE Gen9 baremetal, which doesn't have a
'BootSourceOverrideMode' attribute in its system Boot field, and
raises a 400 iLO.2.14.UnsupportedOperation in response to setting the
boot mode.

This is raised from set_boot_mode as a RedfishError. This change
raises UnsupportedDriverExtension exception when the 'mode' attribute
is missing from the 'boot' field, allowing the deployment to continue.

It got supported starting from 3.42 [1].\n\nI think there\'re no test cases in cinder-tempest-plugin that specifies API version, yet.\nManila project folks solved similar problems in the manila-tempest-plugin tests [2][3] by specifying the share API version to be used. We might take it as an example.\n\nAlternatively, we could specify volume.min_microversion=3.42 in tempest.conf, but it would leave older microversions untested.\n\n[0]

As per the community goal of migrating the policy file
the format from JSON to YAML[1], we need to do two things:

1. Change the default value of '[oslo_policy] policy_file''

When setting the boot settings on Supermicro BMCs, the
BootSourceOverrideEnabled must be set to the desired
value whenever the BootSourceOverrideTarget is set or
it will revert to the default value (Once).  This is
different than what is currently implemented for other
BMCs in which the BootSourceOverrideEnabled is not set
if it matches the current setting.

This change uses the vendor setting to determine if it's
a Supermicro BMC.

Get rid of the TODO in the code and prepare for more management
interfaces supporting detect_vendor(). Vendor detecting now runs
during transition to manageable and on power state sync (essentially
same as before but for all drivers not only IPMI).

Update the IPMI implementation to no longer hide exceptions since
they're not handled on the upper level. Simplify the regex and fix
the docstring.

Add the Redfish implementation as a foundation for future
vendor-specific changes.

When setting the boot settings on Supermicro BMCs, the
BootSourceOverrideEnabled must be set to the desired
value whenever the BootSourceOverrideTarget is set or
it will revert to the default value (Once).  This is
different than what is currently implemented for other
BMCs in which the BootSourceOverrideEnabled is not set
if it matches the current setting.

This change uses the vendor setting to determine if it's
a Supermicro BMC.

We attempt to parse the 'DBDuplicateEntry' exceptions raised by oslo.db
in the event of an integrity error to provide more useful information to
the user about what they did wrong. To do that, we're looking at the
'columns' attribute of this exception, which should list the conflicting
column(s), and extracting entries from the user-provided data based on
these columns names. However, on MySQL 8.x this does not return a column
name but rather a constraint name. This results in a KeyError when we
attempt to show the offending data by pulling it out by ""column"" name.
For example:

  KeyError: 'resource_providers.uniq_resource_providers0name'

The solution is simple. Since there are only two unique constraints for
the 'ResourceProvider' model, we can simply check for these and map them
to their corresponding columns if found. The existing code can be
retained as a fallback for other database backends and legacy MySQL
versions.

With the merging of the pcs on host patchset for train we are seeing a
problem with FFUs on Instance HA environments.

Preamble:
Tripleo keeps the stonith-enabled cluster property set to false until the puppet step 5

With the pcs on host patchset the enablement happens still at step 5 but
it gets triggered during tripleo_ha_wrapper deployment task of
cinder-volume which tries to restart the cinder-volume service (during
the leapp of the first controller) and this hangs forever because
pacemaker is in the following transition:
- stonith-fence_compute-fence-nova is configured
- pacemaker wants to call stonith on for controller-0 (which is probably
  dumb, but it is unlikely we'll be able to change that in the right
  timeframe as it seems a potentially involved change in behaviour)
- Any other action, like cinder-volume restart in this case, is stuck
  and the FFU fails.

If we simply move the stonith resource creation (and change nothing else
in the stonith-enabled property being set at step 5) to step 2, we
fix this.

Tested and with the injection of this puppet-tripleo review into the
FFU queens->train upgrade on an IHA system, now the FFU passes.
Also applied this patch to a Train based IHA deployment and verified
that deployment, redeploy, minor update and scaleup all keep on working.

This change uses dnf to build the container image for Centos-8
using dnf locally rather than rely on an external image that is
downloaded and unpacked.

The existing image prestage commands are made conditional, and
an operating system specific command can be provided via role
variables to build a chroot in /var/lib/machines.

During the transition from Centos-8 to Centos-8-Stream, the
vars files are separated, with vars/redhat.yml covering Stream,
and vars/centos-8.3.yml covering legcay Centos-8.

In addition, the systemd-logind service is masked from the base
image. This is masked in the previously downloaded container base
image, so we ensure that the same is done for locally built chroots.

DHCP notification is done after each create/update/delete for
network, subnet and port.
This notification currently has to retrieve network from DB almost
every time, which is a quite heavy DB request and hence affects
performance of port and subnet CRUD.

This patch suggests 2 optimizations:
- do not fetch network if not needed (only fetch when schedule needed)
- for port and subnet AFTER_CREATE event pass network dict from plugin

According to Rally tests these changes improve performance:
- port create ~20%
- port update ~20%
- subnet create ~15%
- port delete and subnet update/delete - not tested

Whilst we wait for further information to understand the root cause

Commands in the Ceph driver are directed at the mon
daemon instead of at the mgr daemon.

The driver's rados_command() calls json_command() and,
by default, json_command() calls the python
rados client's mon_command() instead of mgr_command().

By passing the target as mon-mgr, the python rados
client's mgr_command() is called as desired, and we
avoid the need of extra MON write caps.

Router_info class and metadata agent's driver are using same
instance of the iptables manager class and it could happend that
sometimes e.g. nat rule which packets send to 169.254.169.254:80
redirects to the port 9697 so haproxy can process them, can be missed as
they will be overwritten by the Router_info class manipulating other
rules in the same 'nat' rules list.

This patch fixed that by adding lock for methods which are changing
rules in iptables_manager's nat table in both router_info and
the metadata agent's driver.

""nftables"" compatible binary, ""ebtables-nft"", is not 100% compatible
with the legacy API, as reported in LP#1922892.

This patch fixes the following issues when using ""ebtables-nft"" (while
keeping compatibility with legacy binary):
- When a new chain is created, a default DROP rule is added at the end
  of the chain (append). This will prevent the error code 4 when the
  chain is listed.
- The chain rules are added at the begining of the chain (insert),
  before the default DROP rule. This will prioritize the port rules.
- The MAC rules are cleaned before the new ones are added. That will
  prevent the deletion of any new needed rule, now added after the
  deletion.
- The ""ebtables"" command will retry on error code 4. This is the
  error returned when the chains are listed and no rule is present
  in a new created chain (reporeted in LP#1922892).

This code is backwards compatible, that means it works with the legacy
""ebtables"" binary; this is currently installed in the Neutron CI [1].
In order to test with the new binary, ""ebtables-nft"", two new CI jobs
are added to the periodic queue [2].

Commands in the Ceph driver are directed at the mon
daemon instead of at the mgr daemon.

The driver's rados_command() calls json_command() and,
by default, json_command() calls the python
rados client's mon_command() instead of mgr_command().

By passing the target as mon-mgr, the python rados
client's mgr_command() is called as desired, and we
avoid the need of extra MON write caps.

This patchset makes the current ceph-client helm test more specific
about checking each of the PGs that are transitioning through inactive
states during the test. If any single PG spends more than 30 seconds in
any of these inactive states (peering, activating, creating, unknown,
etc), then the test will fail.

Also, if after the three minute PG checking period is expired, we will
no longer fail the helm test, as it is very possible that the autoscaler
could be still adjusting the PGs for several minutes after a deployment
is done.

Currently if the baremetal boot mode is unknown and the driver doesn't
support setting the boot mode then the error is logged and deployment
continues.

However if the BMC doesn't support getting or setting the boot mode
then setting the boot mode raises an error which results in the deploy
failing. This is the case for HPE Gen9 baremetal, which doesn't have a
'BootSourceOverrideMode' attribute in its system Boot field, and
raises a 400 iLO.2.14.UnsupportedOperation in response to setting the
boot mode.

This is raised from set_boot_mode as a RedfishError. This change
raises UnsupportedDriverExtension exception when the 'mode' attribute
is missing from the 'boot' field, allowing the deployment to continue.

sometimes e.g. nat rule which packets send to 169.254.169.254:80
redirects to the port 9697 so haproxy can process them, can be missed as

The thing that OpenStack offers that nothing else really can is hard multitenancy. But hobbyist developers working on their own don't need hard multitenancy. Even small teams don't need hard multitenancy. The minimum size of organisation that requires OpenStack is one that has to cater to mutliple individuals or groups that mutually distrust one another. People who don't need hard multitenancy have always had other solutions available, from oVirt through to Kubernetes. The - widely prevalent - hope that armies of hobbyist developers are going to show up to work on OpenStack has always been a fantasy, because by design OpenStack does not offer them anything they need. All of the use cases you mention here would be better served by something like k3s IMHO.\n\nThere *is* something to be said for being able to spin up a small local cloud that you can test against prior to deploying your applications against a real (expensive) public cloud.

But I\'d argue that the tinkerer usually has the luxury to be opinionated, and can therefore deploy more specialized single-tenant infrastructure. So I don\'t expect that many ""production"" use cases.\n\nI\'m not sure what would technically need to be done to better support that lower end.

Timemaster service uses /etc/chrony.conf and /etc/ptp4l.conf to create
runtime instance for these 2 timeservices. These 2 time services sync to
their respective time source. Timemaster provides HA between chrony
and PTP (between different PTP domains as well which is not part of
this patch).Timemaster compares all time sources and use the best
sources to synchronize the system clock. if chronyd commuication breaks
then timemaster will set system time with PTP grand master's provided
time and vice a versa.

It still makes sense to carry a variable for defining dns_domain
since deployers will be able to control them with single variable
for all services.

Use localhost and container1 as proper targets for the test playbook
rather than a combination of import_tasks/delegate_to for container1.

The previous code did not run the imported tasks against container1,
but instead a second time against localhost. This makes the handlers
checking the output from ansible diff fail as on the second run
against localhost there are no changes, giving an empty diff.

Changing the test play targets to localhost:container1 makes it more
obvious that the whole test playbook should be run against the host

the host to a container.
