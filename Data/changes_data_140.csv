If a live migration without a specific destination has been requested,
the conductor will get a list of potential destinations from the
scheduler. The conductor will then proceed to check if the destination
can accommodate the instance by calling check_can_live_migrate_destination.

However, this call is made in _find_destination by calling
_call_livem_checks_on_host, which will then remotely call the method
mentioned above, and passing it self.limits, which at that point is still None.

On the nova-compute side, check_can_live_migrate_destination will also create
the resource claim, which also includes the soon-to-used NUMA topology that
will be used by the live-migrated instance. For this, the function
numa_fit_instance_to_host is called, which will return the first match that
will fit the instance NUMA topology. This function will also receive those
limits from the conductor, and because it's always None, CPU and memory
allocation ratios are never respected for the NUMA node 0, so NUMA node 0
is always a valid candidate for Live Migrations, which means that with
every Live Migration the NUMA node 0 will get more and more overcommited,
eventually causing VMs to get into OOM as well.

This commit simply passes those limits received from the scheduler onto
nova-compute, so they can be used to make sure we don't overcommit NUMA nodes.
Those limits are created by the NUMATopologyFilter.

This patch adds new authorization protocol - jwt_token.
It allows to access endpoint '/v3/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/{IDP_NAME}/protocols/jwt_token/auth' (and obtain keystone auth token) using JWT token in Authorization header field.
Header value is checked against proper formating and JWT token is extracted from it.
Then, token is validated against proper signature, issuer, expiration date and others.
Then, if this end with success, payload from token is supplied to mapping engine, when new user is created.

This can be usefull in CLI-like API access to openstack with connection to OAuth or other IdP provider.
You can supply env like
	export OS_IDENTITY_PROVIDER=""idp_name""
	export OS_PROTOCOL=""jwt_token""
	export OS_AUTH_TYPE=""v3oidcclientcredentials""
	export OS_ACCESS_TOKEN_ENDPOINT="".../oauth/token""
	export OS_CLIENT_ID='...'
	export OS_CLIENT_SECRET='...'

In this scenario, JWT token is obtainer from oauth endpoint and then supplied to keystone, where is beeing parsed, validated.
New user is created (according to mappings) and access is given.

This patch adds new authorization protocol - jwt_token.
It allows to access endpoint '/v3/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/{IDP_NAME}/protocols/jwt_token/auth' (and obtain keystone auth token) using JWT token in Authorization header field.
Header value is checked against proper formating and JWT token is extracted from it.
Then, token is validated against proper signature, issuer and expiration date and others.
Then, if this end with success, payload from token is supplied to mapping engine, when new user is created.

In neutron CI queues we were running tempest-slow-py3 and
tempest-ipv6-only jobs which are defined in tempest repository and runs
all tests, e.g related to Swift or Cinder.
This patch defines new jobs: ""neutron-tempest-slow-py3"" and
""neutron-tempest-ipv6-only"" which inherits from the tempest jobs but
disables Cinder and Swift services.
Additionally ""neutron-tempest-ipv6-only"" job now runs only
""integrated-networking"" tox_envlist.

Originally in master branch it was done in patch [1] but due to
completly different structure of zuul config files in stable/ussuri in
newer branches, there is no point to do regular cherry-pick to
stable/train branch from there. So this patch is doing similar change
but it's valid only for stable/train and older branches.

Currently mapping engine can map multiple projects for user  (as stated in https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/pike/advanced-topics/federation/mapping_combinations.html), but this support
lacks from (a) dynamic mapping projects from assertion (for ex. projects ids are in assertion) and (b) mapping engine cannot map to list from assertion (if in asertion we have
""some_field"": [ id1, id2, ..., idN ] - then using this field by substitution - eg ""{1}"" wont map this to whole needed structure of projects in mapping).

In patch I extend mapping schema by adding new field ""projects_spec"" of type string.
This field contains string formated like
  project1ID:role1:role2:..:roleN,project2ID:role1:...:roleN,...
and this is mapped into proper structure { ""projects"": [  { ""id"": .., ""roles"": [ ... ] }, ... ] }

this allows the identity provider to supply permission-like informations about what projects user should have access to.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect
rule on releases.openstack.org so that anyone working on this branch
will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/wallaby branch, tests will
continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

It appeary running the tmpwatch from the cron.daily location isn't
possible: the way cron/anacron is running things appears to break
SELinux context at some point, leading to SELinux denials caused by a
weird need for dac_override.

In order to NOT allow this dac_override (security hazard), and after
extensive testing, it seems it's better to push the job directly in
root's crontab.

We have a separate doc page for middlewares that pulls the docstring
from each middleware's docstring[0]. This makes it easy to look up the docs
in our documentation and easy to find the middleware doc by looking in
the code of the middleware itself.

This patch does the same with the audit watchers. There is now a page
that generates a list of audit watchers, even though currently it's only
one, and pulls the docs from their docstrings. Giving us an easy way to
maintain each audit watcher doc along with it's code.

The common playbooks for cinder, neutron and nova have an initial
facts gathering step.

This patch switches from implicit gather_facts to direct use of
the ansible setup module. The minimum set of facts are gathered,
and an additional filtered set of facts about the target processor
count is gathered. The processor count is used in many service
templates to set the number or threads/processes used.

This approach significantly reduces the size of the gathered
facts which cannot be achieved directly with a gather_subset
of '!all,min,hardware'.

In addition, all uses of ansible facts are converted to
ansible_facts[].

It appeary running the tmpwatch from the cron.daily location isn't
possible: the way cron/anacron is running things appears to break
SELinux context at some point, leading to SELinux denials caused by a
weird need for dac_override.

In order to NOT allow this dac_override (security hazard), and after
extensive testing, it seems it's better to push the job directly in
root's crontab.

We keep worrying about the memory footprint involved in adding a ring to
a service that does not currently use one. Why not have an isolated
process per node which is solely responsible for doing ring lookups?

We can continue to do things like plumbing object-update targets through
to the object-server from the proxy -- if it makes sense, do it! But
now:

  - We don't have to worry about loading up rings in a container-server
    to answer questions about the state of its ring, and
  - We can reduce the overall memory overhead by removing rings from
    background daemons in favor of querying the ring service.

TODO:
  - Figure out a way to (cheaply) resume handoff enumeration rather than
    always requesting ""a bunch""
  - Think about other useful questions to ask of rings (maybe ""what are
    all the partitions this device is responsible for?"", for example)
  - Have backend daemons include response headers indicating whether
    they think they're a primary for a resource

It appeary running the tmpwatch from the cron.daily location isn't

SELinux context at some point, leading to SELinux denials caused by a
weird need for dac_override.

In order to NOT allow this dac_override (security hazard), and after

Sometimes we get an unexpected failure on the lvs command where it exits
with code 139, which is not one of the 5 predefined ones in the code
ECMD_PROCESSED, ENO_SUCH_CMD, EINVALID_CMD_LINE, EINIT_FAILED, or
ECMD_FAILED.

We've seen this happen mostly on CI jobs when deleting a volume, on the
check to see if the volume is present (``_volume_not_present``) and
makes the whole operation unexpectedly fail.

When looking at the logs we can find other instances of this same exit
code happening in other calls, but those are fortunately to be covered
by retries for other unexpected errors such as bug #1335905 that seem to
make the call eventually succeed.

The stderr of the failure is polluted with debug and warning messages
such as:

  [1] /dev/sda1: stat failed: No such file or directory

      This has been removed [2] from the LVM code indicating it's
      somewhat troublesome, but doesn't explain how.

  [3] Path /dev/sda1 no longer valid for device(8,1)

  [4] WARNING: Scan ignoring device 8:0 with no paths.

But the real error is most likely:

  [5]: Device open /dev/sda 8:0 failed errno 2

On failure we see that error twice, because the code retries it in LVM
trying to workaround some kind of unknown udev race [6].

Since the LVM code indicates that a retry can help, we'll retry on error
139 when calling ``get_lv_info``.

To narrow down the retry we'll only do it on error 139, so we modify the
existing ``retry`` decorator to accept the ``retry`` parameter (same as
the tenacity library) and create our own retry if the
ProcessExecutionError fails with a specific error.

This pattern seems better than blindly retrying all
ProcessExecutionError cases.

Previously we managed to get away with starting FRR during deployment
tasks at step1. This worked because puppet config tasks (which need
all nodes to be reachable due to pacemaker) ran after deployment step
task 1. In our testing also TLS-E setups worked okay, but that was
likely mainly due to coincidence because the IPA registration tasks
were also run at step1 of the deployment tasks and came after FRR.
FRR is needed to be up in order to reach nodes like freeipa in a BGP
based deployment.

https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/+/771832
moved IPA role from deployment_step 1 to external_deployment_step 1 and
this broke TLS-E deployments with FRR, because FRR is not up already
during external deployment step 1.

So we simply make this more robust by moving the FRR container
configuration during the host_prep_tasks. This requires that we
duplicate the deploy-steps-tasks-step-1 tasks (kolla configs,
container-startup-configs) and the podman host_prep_tasks when using
the FRR service.

Note: We also duplicate the podman host_prep_tasks here because
we have no strict guarantee that they run before ours.

Tested as follows:
- Deployed an FRR-enabled TLS-E environment from master (was previously
  failing)
- Deployed an FRR-enabled without TLS-E from master

quay.ceph.io is maintained by the Ceph organization and can

As noted in previous discussions, glance should clean its staging
directory on startup. This is important for scenarios where we
started an import operation, but failed in the middle. If, when we
recover, the image has already been deleted from the database, then
we will never remove the (potentially very large) residue from disk
in our staging directory.

This is currently a problem with web-download, but will also occur
with glance-direct once we have the non-shared distributed import
functionality merged.

OS-Brick disconnect_volume code assumes that the use_multipath parameter
that is used to instantiate the connector has the same value than the
connector that was used on the original connect_volume call.

Unfortunately this is not necessarily true, because Nova can attach a
volume, then its multipath configuration can be enabled or disabled, and
then a detach can be issued.

This leads to a series of serious issues such as:

- Not flushing the single path on disconnect_volume (possible data loss)
  and leaving it as a leftover device on the host when Nova calls
  terminate-connection on Cinder.

- Not flushing the multipath device (possible data loss) and leaving it
  as a leftover device similarly to the other case.

This patch changes how we do disconnects, now we assume we are always
disconnecting multipaths, and fallback to doing the single path
disconnect we used to do if we can't go that route.

The case when we cannot do a multipathed detach is mostly when we did
the connect as a single path and the Cinder driver doesn't provide
portal_targets and portal_iqns in the connection info for non
multipathed initialize-connection calls.

This changes introduces an additional call when working with single
paths (checking the discoverydb), but it should be an acceptable
trade-off to not lose data.

Also includes squash to add release note from:

When the replicator update method calls diskfile._get_hashes on a
local partition the partition path can be unicode [1]. If _get_hashes
does a listdir then os.listdir will return unicode values, and any new
suffixes will be written to the hashes.pkl as unicode. When the
hashes.pkl is next read, these unicode suffixes would previously fail
the valid_suffix check and read_hashes would return {'valid': False},
causing a rehash.

When _get_hashes is called from an object server REPLICATE handler,
the device path is bytes and any listdir would return suffixes as
bytes, so the suffix would then be written to hashes.pkl as bytes, and
not cause an error when read_hashes was next called.

This patch modifies diskfile.valid_suffix to allow suffixes to be
unicode or byte strings.

[1] the replication job device is set from the ring devs, and rings
can have unicode device values.

This reverts commit d5da2121f875109a94809eeb8aa271fd5a0b3edd. This was
done incorrectly. The 'D1_D2_SETUP_ARGS' dictionary modified here is a
mapping of distutils (and by extension, setuptools) supported options to
their legacy distutils2 equivalents, and is used to transform the latter
to the former. For example, consider the following entry:

  ""long_description"": (""metadata"", ""description""),

This will transform an entry like so in a 'setup.cfg' file:

  [metadata]
  description = ...

Into the following equivalent call to setuptools' 'setup' function:

  setup(
      ...,
      long_description='...',
      ...
  )

By that measure, the entry added in this change, namely:

  ""requires_python"": (""metadata"", ""python_requires""),

Will result in a 'requires_python' argument being added to the 'setup'
call. That's not what we want. Rather, we likely want to transform a
'[metadata] requires_python' entry to a 'python_requires' argument to
'setup'.

The change is reverted here in expectation of a forthcoming proper fix.

Previously the tempest plugins were driven by the legacy
`cycle-automatic` model. However this model have been abandoned.

The cycle-automatic release model is now better described by the
`cycle-with-intermediary` model combined with `stable-branch-type: none`

The `cycle-automatic` model was used by specific technical deliverables
that needed to be automatically released once at the end of a cycle.

the tempest-plugin are branchless and `cycle-with-intermediary`
however our process doesn't handle them at the end of the cycle
like did the `cycle-automatic`.

These changes clarifying that point.

uninstalled.
This commit move the stop_redis step to the octavia_stop step and
ensures that stopping redis doesn't fail.

Keystone's update_user() method in the SQL driver processes a lot of
information about how to update users. This includes evaluating password
logic and authentication attempts for PSI-DSS. This logic is evaluated
after keystone pulls the user record from SQL and before it exits the
context manager, which performs the write.

When multiple clients are all updating the same user reference, it's
more likely they will see an HTTP 500 because of race conditions exiting
the context manager. The HTTP 500 is due to stale data when updating
password expiration for old passwords, which happens when setting a new
password for a user.

This commit attempts to handle that case more gracefully than throwing a
500 by detecting StaleDataErrors from sqlalchemy and retrying.  The
identity sql backend will retry the request for clients that have
stale data change from underneath them.

We have discovered that if an exception is raised at any point during
the running of the init_application WSGI script in an apache/mod_wsgi
Daemon Mode environment, it will prompt apache/mod_wsgi to re-run the
script without starting a fresh python process. Because we initialize
global data structures during app init, subsequent runs of the script
blow up as some global data do *not* support re-initialization. It is
anyway not safe to assume that init of global data is safe to run
multiple times.

This mod_wsgi behavior appears to be a special situation that does not
behave the same as a normal reload in Daemon Mode as the script file is
being reloaded upon failure instead of the daemon process being
shutdown and restarted as described in the documentation [1].

In order to handle this situation, we can move the initialization of
global data structures to a helper method that is decorated to run only
once per python interpreter instance. This way, we will not attempt to
re-initialize global data that are not safe to init more than once.

There are a few places where we have a play with one task that uses the
group_by module to generate groups that are used in a subsequent play.
These plays do not need to gather facts for their target hosts.

In particular, the kolla-openstack.yml playbook should really be able to
operate without access to remote hosts.

This change also adds changed_when: false to all group_by tasks, since
they show as changed but haven't really made any changes outside of
Ansible.

If a live migration without a specific destination has been requested,
the conductor will get a list of potential destinations from the
scheduler. The conductor will then proceed to check if the destination
can accommodate the instance by calling check_can_live_migrate_destination.

However, this call is made in _find_destination by calling
_call_livem_checks_on_host, which will then remotely call the method
mentioned above, and passing it self.limits, which at that point is still None.

On the nova-compute side, check_can_live_migrate_destination will also create
the resource claim, which also includes the soon-to-used NUMA topology that
will be used by the live-migrated instance. For this, the function
numa_fit_instance_to_host is called, which will return the first match that
will fit the instance NUMA topology. This function will also receive those
limits from the conductor, and because it's always None, CPU and memory
allocation ratios are never respected for the NUMA node 0, so NUMA node 0
is always a valid candidate for Live Migrations, which means that with
every Live Migration the NUMA node 0 will get more and more overcommited,
eventually causing VMs to get into OOM as well.

This commit simply passes those limits received from the scheduler onto
nova-compute, so they can be used to make sure we don't overcommit NUMA nodes.
Those limits are created by the NUMATopologyFilter.

It appeary running the tmpwatch from the cron.daily location isn't
possible: the way cron/anacron is running things appears to break
SELinux context at some point, leading to SELinux denials caused by a
weird need for dac_override.

In order to NOT allow this dac_override (security hazard), and after
extensive testing, it seems it's better to push the job directly in
root's crontab.

There are a few places where we have a play with one task that uses the
group_by module to generate groups that are used in a subsequent play.
These plays do not need to gather facts for their target hosts.

In particular, the kolla-openstack.yml playbook should really be able to
operate without access to remote hosts.

This change also adds changed_when: false to all group_by tasks, since
they show as changed but haven't really made any changes outside of
Ansible.

TrivialFix

In commit 7c1d964faa we fixed how we disable greendns. This patch adds
a test for this. It also lays down the groundwork for future tests
of how we manage eventlet's monkeypatching.

How and what eventlet monkeypatches can be controlled by environment
variables that are processed by eventlet at import-time (for exmaple,
EVENTLET_NO_GREENDNS). Nova manages all of this in nova.monkey_patch.
Therefore, nova.monkey_patch must be the first thing to import
eventlet. As nova.tests.functional.__init__ imports nova.monkey_patch,
our new test can go in the functional tree.

OS-Brick disconnect_volume code assumes that the use_multipath parameter
that is used to instantiate the connector has the same value than the
connector that was used on the original connect_volume call.

Unfortunately this is not necessarily true, because Nova can attach a
volume, then its multipath configuration can be enabled or disabled, and
then a detach can be issued.

This leads to a series of serious issues such as:

- Not flushing the single path on disconnect_volume (possible data loss)
  and leaving it as a leftover device on the host when Nova calls
  terminate-connection on Cinder.

- Not flushing the multipath device (possible data loss) and leaving it
  as a leftover device similarly to the other case.

This patch changes how we do disconnects, now we assume we are always
disconnecting multipaths, and fallback to doing the single path
disconnect we used to do if we can't go that route.

The case when we cannot do a multipathed detach is mostly when we did
the connect as a single path and the Cinder driver doesn't provide
portal_targets and portal_iqns in the connection info for non
multipathed initialize-connection calls.

This changes introduces an additional call when working with single
paths (checking the discoverydb), but it should be an acceptable
trade-off to not lose data.

Also includes squash to add release note from:

Some node network_config options defined in the baremetal
deployment yaml definition can't be stored on neutron resources
as tags, because tag strings has a limited max lenght.

In the triple-ansible change https://review.opendev.org/772766
the baremetal deployment workflow put's this data into a config
file. With this change the config in the file source is merged
into the generated ansible inventory.

Backend creation should happen on the last host in the group, instead
of the first one, since we put LB in MAINT state during deployment, while
other containers are not ready yet. Thus we should be creating backends
at the very end of the deployment, when all containers are set.

This patch adds basic configuration for tox-ansible[1].

Tox-ansible is a plugin for tox which auto-generates tox environments
for running quality assurance tools like ansible-test or molecule. This
tool is rather tightly integrated for the official Molecule testing tool
that integrates with Ansible.

At first, it will allow us to list very quickly all the Ansible Molecule
tests for each roles with their scenario(s):

Example:

    $ tox -l
    ...
    roles-ceph-ceph-ansible-installed
    roles-ceph-default
    roles-check_kernel_version-default
    roles-check_network_gateway-default

I0c3f14100a18107f7e416293f3d4fcc641ce5e55 introduced new logic when
extending LUKSv1 encrypted rbd volumes. As part of this qemu-img is used
to probe the rbd volume to determine the size of the LUKSv1 header.

The URI used to point to the rbd volume did not provide a user and
assumed that n-cpu/privsep would have access to the admin keyring. This
isn't always the case in most environments and would result in a failure
to probe the disk when the admin keyring wasn't available.

This change resolves this by appending the `id:$username` option to the
end of the URI provided to qemu-img using the `auth_username` found in
the connection_info from Cinder.

During an assisted volume snapshot delete request from Cinder nova
removes the snapshot from the backing file chain. During that nova
checks the existence of such file. However in some cases (see the bug
report) the path is relative and therefore os.path.exists fails.

This patch makes sure that nova uses the volume absolute path to make
the backing file path absolute as well.

Adds a repair command that reads shard ranges from the container DB,
identifies overlapping shard ranges and recommends how overlaps can be
repaired by shrinking into a single chosen path.  Prompted user input
or a '-y' option will then cause the appropriately modified shard
ranges to be merged into the container DB.

The repair command does not fix gaps in shard range paths and can
therefore only succeed if there is at least one unbroken path of
shards through the entire namespace.

Also adds an analyze command that loads shard data from a file and
reports overlapping shard ranges, but takes no action.  The analyze
command is similar to the repair command but reads shard data from
file rather than a container db and makes no changes to the db.

e.g.:
  swift-manage-shard-ranges <db-file-name> repair
  swift-manage-shard-ranges <shard-data.json> analyze

to see more detail:
  swift-manage-shard-ranges -v <shard-data.json> analyze

For consistency with the new repair command, and to be more cautious,
this patch changes the user input required to apply the compact
command changes to the DB from 'y' to 'yes'.

There are a few places where we have a play with one task that uses the

These plays do not need to gather facts for their target hosts.

In particular, the kolla-openstack.yml playbook should really be able to
operate without access to remote hosts.

they show as changed but haven't really made any changes outside of

Keystone's update_user() method in the SQL driver processes a lot of
information about how to update users. This includes evaluating password
logic and authentication attempts for PSI-DSS. This logic is evaluated
after keystone pulls the user record from SQL and before it exits the
context manager, which performs the write.

When multiple clients are all updating the same user reference, it's
more likely they will see an HTTP 500 because of race conditions exiting
the context manager. The HTTP 500 is due to stale data when updating
password expiration for old passwords, which happens when setting a new
password for a user.

This commit attempts to handle that case more gracefully than throwing a
500 by detecting StaleDataErrors from sqlalchemy and retrying.  The
identity sql backend will retry the request for clients that have
stale data change from underneath them.

When SolidFire is under heavy load or being upgraded, the
SolidFire cluster may automatically move connections from primary
to secondary nodes, in order to rebalance cluster workload.

Although this operation ocurrs very quickly, if an operation is made
to a volume at the same time it's being moved, there might be a
chance that API calls such as create snapshot could fail with
xNotPrimary error. Normally this will succeed on a retry of the
operation.

This patch fixes this issue by adding the xNotPrimary exception to
our list of retryable exceptions in the SolidFire driver.

The SolidFire driver retries API requests in case a connection
error occurrs. When network is unstable, there may be the
possibility that the SolidFire backend successfully receive
and process a create volume operation, but fail to deliver the
response back to the driver.

When this scenario occurrs, the SolidFire driver automatically
resends the request, creating a second volume and leaving a
duplicate unused. Although this doesn't affect
driver functionality at first moment (the volume id from the
cluster is always correctly associated to cinder provider id),
further operations may hit the unused volume, leading to
unexpected hehavior.

This patch fixes this issue by:

1. Checking if the volume name already exists in the
backend before trying to create it. Volume creation will
raise a exception and abort in case of a volume is found.

2. Checking for volume creation right after a read timeout is
detected, preventing invalid API calls.

3. Adding option ´sf_volume_create_timeout´ to the SolidFire
driver, to allow users to set the appropriate timeout value for
their environment.

Some hardware is very well intentioned. However this intention
can result in the UEFI NVRAM table being full which prevents us
from adding new records to the table. We can't be sure what to
delete, so in this case some operators just need the ability to
tell ironic ""it is okay if this fails, it will still work.""

The added ``ignore_bootloader_failure`` option adds
this capability which can be set per-node either in the agent
configuation via the ramdisk image, or in the pxe_append_params
configuration parameter for the node itself with a
``ipa-ignore-bootloader-failure`` option in order to prevent
the failure from being raised.

Ironic's sample configuration page previously did not render any
of the items in the default section, except for those items added
by other libraries. This was because we were trying to use an iterator
instead of a list.

Using an iterator, in theory should have worked, and did work for
normal invocations, but didn't work when it came to sphinx generated
output.

Instead of trying to use itertools to assemble everything, we just
now instead assemble the list and use a list_opts method like some
of the other more complex groups to add values.

Confirmed in local build output that the sphinx generated output
works as expected now.

The unit test 'tackerclient.tests.unit.osc.v1.test_vnflcm_op_occs.
TestListVnfLcmOp.test_take_action_with_filter' is failing with below
error message,
DEBUG: TypeError: Object of type 'FormatComplexDataColumn' is not
JSON serializable

Background:
In class TestListVnfLcmOp definition, ""create_vnflcm_op_occs"" function
is called and list of fake vnflcm op occs dictionary is store in
vnflcm_op_occs_obj.
Now this dictionary is used in two unit test cases ""test_take_action""
and ""test_take_action_with_filter"".
In order to evaluate test results, in ""test_take_action"" test case,
""get_vnflcm_op_occ_data"" function is called using ""vnflcm_op_occs_obj""
which appends the data in dictionary.

Later this dictionary ""vnflcm_op_occs_obj"" is again used in
""test_take_action_with_filter"".

Implementation:
This patch creates a separate list of fake vnflcm op occs dictionary for
both the test cases.

Ports with device_owner like:

So there is no need to reload dnsmasq every time when such port is

The ALPN for pools patch introduced a bug that causes amphora to
fail if the HAProxy version running inside the amphroa does not
support ALPN on backend members (bionic images for example).
This patch adds compatibility support for those older HAProxy versions
by removing the ALPN configuration settings if the HAProxy version
is too old to support the functionality.

Currently in TripleO we are implementing tls support for memcached,
which requires puppet-memcached >= 3.7.0. This change bumps version of
puppet-memcached used during tets to the one with tls support, so that
we can use the proper version of puppet-memcached in unit tests of
puppet-tripleo.
Because there are no changes made until 3.7.0 which is likely to
break interfaces used in current puppet modules it is considered to
be safe to bump that minor version at this moment.

safe removing the device classes coverage.

Normally, when the root container leader decides that a shard should
shrink, it pushes two piece of information to the shard replicas:

  * its state is now shrinking, and
  * knowledge of the shard range it should be shrinking into.

If the root fails to push that information, there isn't too much harm --
it'll try again on the next round. But the if the shard runs its sharder
before then, currently it will fetch and updates its own range from the
root, giving it the first piece of information but not the second.

Interestingly, the response from the root will include *both* shards,
since both overlap the range the shard is responsible for. There's an
opportunity for an optimization: when our own shard (as retrieved from
the root) is shrinking or sharded, we can save all of the shards we
received and get to work immediately, without waiting for the root to
push to us.

Also, only expand the acceptor's shard range if the donor transitioned
to sharding -- if it was already there, leave it alone.

Between the two, we can now recover from a sharding split-brain. A root
DB can be fixed-up offline (currently, likely via some manual, in-a-REPL
broker adjustments), the shards will pull down all the information
needed to sort themselves out, and the root will leave the shard bounds
alone the next time it goes looking for shrinking candidates.

During the live migration trunk subports where updated only based
on the ""host_id"" field. But when rpc message to update subports
is send trunk's port is still bound to the old host and has
""migrating_to"" field in binding:profile set to the new host.
Because of that binding:host_id for the subport's port wasn't updated
proberly and port was set to DOWN on the new host.
That could even cause connectivity break if L2population is used in the
cloud.

This patch fixes that by updating subport's binding:host_id field based
on the migrating_to field if that is available and not empty.

Chart upgrading was failing due to some immutable fields are needed to upgrade before the jobs can be upgraded. For solving this issue, we
have added the helm.sh/hook annotations with post-install and post-upgrade values.
As for hook-weight annotations, we have added these to control the flow of the jobs with hook creation as the jobs are dependent. Like,

The .pdf documentation could not be build without errors because the
source code of the documentation contained errors. In addition, there
were other problems:

    - The readme section of the documentation was in .md format
      instead of .rst format. As a result, the created documentation did
      not look good.
    - The .html documentation used deprecated oslosphinx theme instead
      of openstackdocstheme.

This patch fixes the above-mentioned problems and makes sure that
the documentation is generated properly.

Also, this patch updates nodejs4-docs to nodejs10-docs because the
nodejs4-docs was using deprecated nodejs-npm-run-docs job [1].

This change introduces a new option to define the region to which
the Barbican endpoint belongs. This is required if the deployment has
multiple regions and a single Keystone instance stores multiple
Barbican endpoints for different regions.
This change also ensures that the same interface and region are used
in endpoint detection and api version detection.

""_TestWalkMigrations.test_walk_versions"" is inherited in other classes
to check a specific DB revision upgrade. The goal is to, from the
previous DB revision, create a testing condition and then upgrade to
the related DB revision. If the upgrade is correct, the test should
pass.

This patch reduces the number of Neutron DB upgrade operations to
just three:
- Upgrade the DB to the previous DB revision to check.
- Upgrade the DB to the related DB revision, after setting the testing
  conditions.
- A final upgrade up to the latest DB revision.

In a testing deployment, this reduces the execution time from 60 seconds
to 35 seconds, without reducing the testing scope.

If plugin ""network_segment_range"" is not enabled and a new segment
is required, if no segmentation ID is provided in the request, the
segmentation ID assigned is randomly retrieved from the non
allocated segmentation IDs.

The goal is to improve the concurrent network (and segment) creation.
If several segments are created in parallel, this random query
will return a different segmentation ID to each one, avoiding the
database retry request.

The relinker currently blindly calls get_hashes on partitions in the
new, upper half of the partition space, which can cause extra handoffs
to be created if you're rerunning the relink step for safety.

Even if the relinker were smarter, though, there's no reason that a
curious operator should end up creating empty handoffs just because
they're poking devices with REPLICATE requests

Drive-by: be a little more strict about the ""suffixes"" we're willing to
put in hashes.invalid and read out of hashes.pkl.

This policy governs manila APIs that are meant to
be cross tenant - so it should default to system
scope in the new secure rbac system.

Also reformat the policy.py file so that we are
consistent with using ""rules"" as we were doing in
the older releases. Rules abstract keystone
concepts such as roles and scopes.

Lower bounds testing was an optional thing to test but
projects raised question over maintaining it
- http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-discuss/2021-January/019659.html
- http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-discuss/2021-January/019672.html

During the discussion on ML and in the TC meeting, it is decided to
clarify that it is optional to test, and projects can drop it
if they want.
- http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/meetings/tc/2021/tc.2021-03-18-15.01.log.html#l-146

This commit makes few sentence updates about optional lower bounds testing.

Currently in TripleO we are implementing tls support for memcached,
which requires puppet-memcached >= 3.7.0. This change bumps version of
puppet-memcached used during tets to the one with tls support, so that
we can use the proper version of puppet-memcached in unit tests of
puppet-tripleo.
Because there are no changes made until 3.7.0 which is likely to
break interfaces used in current puppet modules it is considered to
be safe to bump that minor version at this moment.

When using the automatic quota refresh via `until_refresh` and `max_age`
configuration options the calculated quota usage by the refresh will not
be correct if there are temporary volumes (such as those created from
snapshots for backups).

Normal quota usage calculation does not work like this, as it has admin
metadata stating that those are temporary volumes and are not used to
increase/decrease quota usage.

This patch fixes this by modifying existing filter that ignores
migrating volumes so it can also ignore temporary volumes based on their
admin metadata.

source/target of the config-download dir for the consistent working dir
from new->old instead of old->new.

We want the old location at ~/config-download/<stack> to be a symlink to
the new location, and store the actual files in the new location. The
symlink is for backwards compatibility. A migration is added for any
files at the old location to the new location, if the new location does
not yet exist.

This patch also changes the default working dir to be a directory under
~/overcloud-deploy for the stack name instead of
~/overcloud-deploy-<stack>. Given multi-stack and multi-overcloud
support, defaulting to using a single directory is a more
straight forward approach and easier to collect.
