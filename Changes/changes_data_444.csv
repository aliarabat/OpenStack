This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

Recently, Keystone renamed ""Member"" role to ""member""
(case-sensitive) with https://review.openstack.org/#/c/572243/14

Case-sensitivity role requirement in Keystone was recently
formalized with https://review.openstack.org/#/c/576640/

From the above reference:

""Role names are case-insensitive. for example, when keystone
bootstraps default roles, it creates `admin`, `member`, and
`reader`. If another role `Member` (note the upper case 'M') is
created, keystone will return a `409` Conflict since it considers
the name ""Member"" == ""member"". Note that case is preserved in these

It follows that Tempest should use ""member"" role by default.

It could happen that instance does not have a host set, e.g.
when its creation failed before it was scheduled.
During online_migration, populate_missing_availability_zones tries to
add missing AZs to all instances. However for instances without a host
there's no reasonable value for AZ (we can't use a logic that bases
the value on a host) so let's skip this kind of instances completely.

On hosts with dvr_snat agent mode, after restarting OVS agent,
sometimes the SNAT port is processed first instead of the distributed port.
The subnet_info is cached locally via get_subnet_for_dvr when either of these ports
are processed. However, it returns the MAC address of the port used to query
as the gateway for the subnet. Using the SNAT port, this puts the wrong
MAC as the gateway, causing some flows such as the DVR flows on br-int
for local src VMs to have the wrong MAC.

This patch fixes the get_subnet_for_dvr with fixed_ips as None for the csnat port,
as that causes the server side handler to fill in the subnet's actual gateway
rather than using the port's MAC.

The Neutron OVS agent logs can get flooded with KeyErrors as the
'_get_port_info' method skips the added/removed dict items if no
ports have been added/removed, which are expected to be present,
even if those are just empty sets.

This change ensures that those port info dict fields are always set.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

Not debating its validity, just curious about the\n > process.\n\nI think a bit of it can be found in the neutron spec and its comments, but let me summarize here:\n\nOriginally we thought of using the UUID of the neutron agent (as in openstack network agent list) also for the agent RP UUID. However the agent UUID may change (it's rare though, eg. after openstack network agent delete and re-create). As soon as we have allocations on some of the RPs we can't just delete and re-create the RPs. We would need to re-parent RPs. That we wanted to avoid.\n\nIt also helps to keep the communication needs low if both a neutron agent and the server is able to deterministically generate RP UUIDs from inputs they already have (via v5 UUIDs). For example if neutron-server had generated an RP UUID we could have needed a new message to send it back to the agent too.""}, {'account_id': 8313, 'date': '2018-08-06 12:45:38.000000000', 'content':

The Placement API has the concept of resource provider generations to
enable the co-ordination of multiple API clients, so they can avoid
accidentally overwriting each other's updates.

However when we know that a single client writes certain resource
providers then the generation handling becomes an unnecessary extra
API round-trip. Ideally the Placement API would give us a chance to
express our ignorance about multi-client coordination (accepting that
a single client can overwrite its own previous updates).

Until the Placement API gives us such a feature we implement it in
the client lib, by making 'resource_provider_generation' parameters
optional.  This is inferior to the API doing the same because we may
still see GenerationConflict exceptions even when we said
method(..., resource_provider_generation=None).

Later changes for the minimum guaranteed bandwidth
feature need 'resource_provider_generation' to be
optional for 'update_resource_provider_traits' and
'update_resource_provider_inventories'. For the sake of consistency
we do the same to 'update_resource_provider_inventory'.

Like change Ia584dba66affb86787e3069df19bd17b89cb5c49 which
came before, is port binding fails and we have a ""binding_failed""
vif type in the info cache, we'll fail to plug vifs for an
instance on compute restart which will prevent the service
from restarting. Before the os-vif conversion code, this was
handled with VirtualInterfacePlugException but the os-vif conversion
code fails in a different way by raising a generic NovaException
because the os-vif conversion utility doesn't handle a vif_type of
""binding_failed"".

To resolve this and make the os-vif flow for binding_failed behave
the same as the legacy path, we implement a translation function
in os_vif_util for binding_failed which will make the plug_vifs
code raise VirtualInterfacePlugException which is what the
_init_instance code in ComputeManager is already handling.

Admittedly this isn't the smartest thing and doesn't attempt
to recover / fix the instance networking info, but it at least
gives a more clear indication of what's wrong and lets the
nova-compute service start up. A note is left in the
_init_instance error handling that we could potentially try
to heal binding_failed vifs in _heal_instance_info_cache, but
that would need to be done in a separate change since it's more
invasive.

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

In Pike[1], we introduced a user_group auto detection for haproxy.

we support as a base for Amphorae.

user_group remained as an option for admins but was also
marked deprecated in Pike[2].

In https://review.openstack.org/493057/ it was noticed that we
had made a mistake in a previous stable branch addition where
we missed setting stable/newton upgrading to stable/ocata. We
were going to follow up with a different patch to fix it, but

This is really of limited use now since newton is EOL, but

soon.

The direct deploy interface looks promising in the scale tests so far,
but it prevent local testing and PoC with nodes with less than 8 GiB
RAM because it has to convert the overcloud-full image in memory.

This change changes back to the iscsi deploy interface, leaving
the direct deploy interface fully configured and opt-in.

This patch will likely be reverted in Stein.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

As part of sprint 16 we want to remove tripleo.sh usage from ci in
particular the invocation of bootstrap-subnodes [1].

This was initially proposed as stand-alone role in [2] but discussion
has led us to keeping only creation of the ceph loop device, added
here as ansible tasks in a tripleo-ci/ceph.yaml. This is included
in the pre-run for the tripleo-ci-base job (zuul-v3) but not for
legacy jobs. That needs to wait for [3] and related testing/other
changes.

This removes any calls to tripleo.sh --bootstrap-subnodes from the
templated .j2 version of toci_gate_test and common_functions and
adds the new tripleo-ci/ceph.yaml in pre-run of tripleo-ci-base

Non templated scripts can be changed in a followup after [3].

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

This adds a v2 storage interface as well as a gnocchi backend for it to
cloudkitty. This new interface will allow us to implement the v2 API, which will
be more metric-oriented.

This new storage uses the new dataframe format ('desc' is now split up into
'groupby' and 'metadata', following the collect logic); and supports grouping,
filters and pagination.

Modifications:

  * The tenant/scope state management isn't handled by the storage backend
    anymore. A StateManager object has been added.

  * All internal interactions with the storage backend use the v2 interface.
    An adapter class has been added to ensure retrocompatibility with the
    v1 interface.

  * A base class for functional tests testing the v2 storage interface has been
    added. It contains generic tests, which should allow easier testing for new
    v2 backends.

  * Some developer documentation explaining how to implement a v2 storage
    backend has been added. User documentation will be updated once the v2
    storage backend is considered stable.

The v1 is still the default storage version. Note that this new version is
considered unstable and should only be used for upstream development.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run

However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

In order to reduce the packages required to pip install on to the hosts,
we use service delegation to octavia_service_setup_host so that instead
of installing software on the target host, and putting credentials on
every target host, we isolate the software and credentials to a single
host.

In this patch we finally remove octavia_requires_pip_packages as it is
no longer required given that all services use delegation to the
octavia_service_setup_host now. We also remove the task which used to
install them.

We also remove the meta dependency on the openstack_openrc role because
the target host does not require openrc/clouds.yaml any more.

We remove the variable 'octavia_ansible_endpoint_type' as it is no longer
used.

We finally remove the python-pip package from the distro packages, as
with these changes, pip is no longer required on the host - everything
installed by pip is isolated into a venv.

when these interfaces do not come up properly during host preparation.

This change makes the build fail if either:

* The network bridges do not come up after creation
* The new interfaces eth12/13/14 are not up after host bootstrap

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements

The default quotas are often not sufficient for a side wide
load balancing service. This will adjust them to some more
reasonable values.

The os_quota module of ansible assumes an installed
block storage service so it is not suitable for our
tests which don't install cinder. Therefore we
are using the openstack client straight.

Backport note:
Due to changes in master, this is not a clean cherry-pick.
This patch is a re-implementation in a slightly different
way.

This ensures that once the master branch becomes a stable

Under certain conditions detaching a multipath device may result on
failure when flushing one of the individual paths, but the disconnect
should have succeeded, because there were other paths available to flush
all the data.

OS-Brick is currently following standard recommended disconnect
mechanism for multipath devices:

- Release all device holders
- Flush multipath
- Flush single paths
- Delete single devices

The problem is that this procedure does an innecessary step, flushing
individual single paths, that may result in an error.

Originally it was thought that the individual flushes were necessary to
prevent data loss, but upon further study of the multipath-tools and the
device-mapper code it was discovered that this is not really the case.

After the multipath flushing has been completed we can be sure that the
data has been successfully sent and acknowledge by the device.

The issue is resolved for Dell EMC PowerEdge 13th and 14th generation
servers. It is not resolved for PowerEdge 12th generation and earlier
servers.

Prior to this change, the set_boot_device() function in
ironic.drivers.modules.drac.management could successfully set a boot
device that would persist during future boots only when the server's
boot mode was configured to be BIOS. The root cause was that function
understood only a single persistent boot mode, BIOS, and it was hard
coded.

PERSISTENT_BOOT_MODE = 'IPL'

Initial Program Load (IPL) is a synonym for legacy BIOS boot mode.

The iDRAC does not report nor make visible the boot source lists for
persistent boot modes that are not configured as the server's current
boot mode. Only the list associated with the configured boot mode is
reported and can be modified. So, when the boot mode is configured to be
UEFI, the iDRAC permits only its boot source list to be modified.
However, set_boot_device() had been capable of only modifying the boot
source list for BIOS (IPL), which was not reported. Its attempt to
access the wrong, unreported boot source list failed.

This change fixes the issue by determining the configured persistent
boot mode at run-time and modifying its boot source list. The hard
coding of a persistent boot mode has been eliminated. Now, nodes managed
by the iDRAC hardware type successfully boot in either persistent boot
mode, BIOS or UEFI. More information about using the iDRAC for boot
management is available in the ""Dell EMC BIOS and Boot Management
Profile"", Version 4.0.0, section 7.2 Boot Management, pp. 44-47 [1].

The way the iDRAC hardware type deploys the operating system, by copying
it to a disk, posed an additional challenge to this fix. UEFI discovers
new boot sources during the next boot. How could the server be
configured to directly boot into the newly deployed operating system
when its boot source is unknown? It was overcome by using new iDRAC BIOS
attributes named 'SetBootOrderFqddNN' [2]. Those make it possible to
specify the boot source for the next boot without requiring it to be
present in the current boot's boot source list. The server is configured
to directly boot from the disk on which the operating system was just
deployed. An additional reboot is not required. Note that those new
attributes are presently available on only 13th and 14th generation

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run

However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

We've observed error messages in the gate during this test:

   Failed to delete volume: 16f9252c-4036-463b-a053-60d4f46796c1 due to
   Invalid input received: Invalid volume: Volume status must be
   available or error or error_restoring or error_extending and must
   not be migrating, attached, belong to a consistency group or have

Upon investigating, I found that it's the deletion of the first server
in the test that fails for ""Invalid volume"" and it's because we delete
the server *after* we've created a snapshot of it (which creates a
volume snapshot). So the first volume, backing the first server, has a
snapshot and that first volume cannot be deleted until the snapshot is
deleted.

This adds a deletion of the volume snapshot and moves the deletion of
the first server after it.

This patch delivers the first working version of a distributed
scheduler implementation based on local and persistent job
queues. The idea is inspired by the parallel computing pattern
known as ""Work stealing"" although it doesn't fully repeat it
due to a nature of Mistral.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing for details.

Advantages of this scheduler implementation:

* It doesn't have job processing delays when a cluster topology'
  is stable caused by DB polling intervals. A job gets scheduled
  in memory and also saved into the persistent storage for
  reliability. A persistent job can be picked up only after a
  configured allowed period of time so that it happens effectively
  after a node responsible for local processing crashed.
* Low DB load. DB polling still exists but it's not a primary
  scheduling mechamisn now but rather a protection from node crash
  situations. That means that a polling interval can now be made
  large like 30 seconds, instead of 1-2 seconds. Less DB load
  leads to less DB deadlocks between scheduler instances and less
  retries on MySQL.
* Since DB load is now less it gives better scalability properties.
  A bigger number of engines won't now lead to much bigger
  contention because of a big DB polling intervals.
* Protection from having jobs forever hanging in processing state.
  In the existing implementation, if a scheduler captured a job
  for processing (set its ""processing"" flag to True) and then
  crashed then a job will be in processing state forever in the DB.
  Instead of a boolean ""processing"" flag, the new implementation
  uses a timestamp showing when a job was captured. That gives us
  the opportunity to make such jobs eligible for recapturing and
  further processing after a certain configured timeout.

TODO:

* More testing
* DB migration for the new scheduled jobs table
* Benchmarks and testing under load
* Standardize the scheduler interface and write an adapter for the
  existing scheduler so that we could choose between scheduler
  implementations. It's highly desired to make transition to the
  new scheduler smooth in production: we always need to be able
  to roll back to the existing scheduler.

This commit adds servers schema for microversion 2.8 [0]:

Add ‘mks’ protocol and ‘webmks’ type for remote consoles.

The appropriate api_schema files are updated with the
2.8 microversion changes.

Note that no test is added to cover this new microversion
since it isn't possible to test mks protocol in Tempest
gates so as per REVIEWING documentation [1] we shouldn't
add such a test. So, we could only cover the vnc protocol
for 2.8 but this would also not be of much value since
the vnc value (instead of mks) would be returned by the
server.

With the current scheduler architecture, it is possible that a
recurring/periodic delayed call is invoked by the scheduler and the original
call is deleted from the DB but the rescheduling cannot happen
due to any kind of errors. This can cause workflow execution integrity
checks to stop executing and, as a result, the execution to stuck
in Running state.

This change enables the _check_and_complete method to reschedule itself
before the execution is started which brings the deletion of the original
call and the insertion of the new one much closer in time; therefore,
decreasing the possibility of inconsistence. As a side effect of the
insertion and the deletion not being in the same transaction, it may
happen that the call is scheculed more than once, in case the deletion
fails.

'expected_error_codes' are filled with defaults error code[1]
in base class which is nothing but to fill required number
of error codes with 403.

Few tests override the 'expected_error_codes' with 403 itself which
is confusing and inconsistent with other tests.

This commit removes those default overridden values.
