It seems the object server never respected the client_timeout value
since the beginning of Swift. This is normally fine since the proxy does
and will normally hang up on the backends. But if the proxy has a bug or
if there's network issues or whatever, the object server should be smart
enough to enforce this timeout as well.

Our operations guys noticed this problem when older processes would
never exit after a reload. They started investigating and saw that the
object server had open tmp files that hadn't been touched in quite some
time. Sometimes the tmp files didn't even exist anymore since the
reclaimer deletes really old untouched tmp files.

methods to return REQUEUE, but if a driver does not support this we
raise NotImplementedError when the application attempts to requeue
a message.

This requeuing behaviour might only be used by an application in
unusual, exceptional circumstances and catch users by surprise.

Instead, let's require the application to assert that it needs this
feature in advance and raise NotImplementError at that point if the
driver doesn't support it.

Implements: blueprint hyper-v-rdp-console

Currently graphical console access to Nova instances is limited to
clients which are part of Nova itself (novnc, xvpvnc, spice-html5).
The mentioned clients verify the validity of a console access token
with the following private API:
nova.consoleauth.rpcapi.ConsoleAuthAPI.check_token

The usage of a private API precludes the possibility of employing
external graphical console clients, including FreeRDP-WebConnect, used
to connect to Hyper-V instances via RDP.

This change adds a public API method that wraps the aforementioned
check_token private API. This allows external clients to obtain the
necessary protocol connection information by providing a token
previously obtained with calls to get_vnc_console, get_spice_console
or get_rdp_console.

Includes V2 and V3 API implementations.

It is currently possible to create new volume types. These volume types
get default values and they show up in the defaults tab. However, it is
not possible to change those default values. This fix will allow an
admin to change the default values of these new volume types.

The only draw back is that the ordering of the list is somewhat random
due to the nature of a dictionary. The other potential draw back is that
the dialog can grow very large if admin define many new volume types.

contrib/ directory does not follow any standards and will make it
harder to programmatically install plugins on devstack.  The current
structure can also cause namespace collisions when loading them.

This moves all plugin modules to a folder with the same name under
their directory (e.g. contrib/rackspace/rackspace), allowing
requirements, readmes, and other files to be separate from the
actual code.

This also helps to avoid namespace collisions when loading all the
plugins, since all plugins will be under their namespace in the heat
package.  Example:
  heat.engine.plugins
  heat.engine.plugins.docker
  heat.engine.plugins.marconi
  heat.engine.plugins.rackspace

Since plugin packages are now in a folder one level under contrib/,
testr.conf is also updated so that all plugins are discovered
correctly.

Its currently hard to discover what existing calls there are to
XenAPI, and the *_utils.py are getting very large.

Also, with the move to mock, it is becoming hard work testing multiple
calls to call_xenapi within a single method. Moving to this more object
oriented way of calling XenAPI should make writing tests with mock much
easier, and give us an obvious place to move some of simpler helper
methods in vm_utils and volume_utils.

This is the very first step in this direction. Dependent patches will
show how this can be used.

Voelker,mvoelker,"Parameterize cpu_mode

The libvirt cpu_mode setting in nova.conf currently isn't exposed
via the compute::libvirt class, but can be very useful in nested
virtualization situations (as are common in development labs).
The nova default value for the cpu_type parameter if left unspecified
is dependent on the value of the virt_type setting, and both
the virt_type and cpu_mode settings exist within the [libvirt]
section of nova.conf.  This patch adds a parameter allowing users
to set cpu_type with appropriate defaults based on the value
of the libvirt_virt_type parameter.

Based on Change-Id: I0136f15621f616787aba1bbcbf68208bc8f9a1b1 but
not a clean cherry-pick due to a change in the way nova.conf
is organized between Havana and Icehouse.

Closes-bug: #1276510

Although this code error is part of the `ping_listener` tests, it was
missing from the list of known - and ignored - connection errors.

The code error 2013 refers to a connection lost during a query, see:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/error-messages-client.html#error_cr_server_lost

Without this error code, the session won't try to reconnect to mysql,
which makes `max_retries` useless.

This commit makes the reseller admin role configurable. Previously the
swift tests which used the reseller admin role had hardcoded the role
to be the default ResellerAdmin. However the role is configurable, so
this commit adds a new config option which can be used to set the role
to something besides the default.

requirements.txt is only appropriate for libraries that are
always needed, as they will be installed all the time. However
if actually trying to run multinode you won't have databases or
database access on the compute nodes.

So you can't pip install -r requirements.txt on those environments.

For an example, see Nova.

The PAM identity backend has not been maintained nor could it have
functioned since (at least) the grizzly release of OpenStack as the
signatures of the authenticate method (among other methods) do not
match the required signature for the rest of Keystone to utilize it.
With the code bit-rotting and unusable for over two releases it
appears that we could re-evaluate the need for a PAM backend and
implement an auth-plugin that would provide the same basic auth
functionality if there is a demand for it.

If a nova-compute machine restarts when openvswitch comes up it logs the
following warning messages for all tap interfaces that do not exist:

bridge|WARN|could not open network device tap2cf7dbad-9d (No such device)

Once the compute-node starts it recreates the interfaces and re-adds them
to the ovs-bridge. Unfortunately, ovs does not reinitialize the interfaces
as they are already in ovsdb and does not assign them a ofport number.

This situation corrects itself though the next time a port is added to the
ovs-bridge which is why no one has probably noticed this issue till now.

In order to correct this we should first remove interface that exist and
then readd them.

able to make a call to ""/:tenant_id/stacks?global_tenant=true"" and get
all stacks in Heat, and not just the ones owned by the user,
effectively bypassing tenant scoping.

Resource.updated_time is currently being treated as modification time
of the object in the database.  Since it's not a very useful thing to
have and the CFN API treats this value as ""the last time an update
call was issued"", it makes sense to have the same behavior here as
well.

This changes the current real-time retrieval of created_time and
updated_time in favor of the attributes already present in the
resource and changes the information stored in these two fields to be
the time the resource was created and the time the resource was last
updated by the user, respectively.

This change converts the software_config config column to Json

Voelker,mvoelker,"Parameterize cpu_mode

The libvirt cpu_mode setting in nova.conf currently isn't exposed
via the compute::libvirt class, but can be very useful in nested
virtualization situations (as are common in development labs).
The nova default value for the cpu_type parameter if left unspecified
is dependent on the value of the virt_type setting, and both
the virt_type and cpu_mode settings exist within the [libvirt]
section of nova.conf.  This patch adds a parameter allowing users
to set cpu_type with appropriate defaults based on the value
of the libvirt_virt_type parameter.

When booting an instance, the API layer already fetches the image
from glance and passes it to the compute manager. Right now, that
info is ignored and the compute node has fetches the image metadata
again from glance if booting from an image. This is a problem when
booting from a volume, because most of the properties that the volume
keeps when it has been created from an image won't be considered.

With this patch, the image metadata passed to run_instance from the API
will be used if present instead of asking glance again.

Nova currently sends exists notifications only when the resize/rebuild
operations begin. When resize/rebuild span audit periods, this causes
some values from the period between the time that the previous audit
period ended to the time at which the rebuild/resize finishes, to be
ignored. This commit fixes that by sending another exists notification when
the resize/rebuild operations finish.

   specific ports and create custom rule

   which allows access to 3306 port - here comes bottleneck,

Changes:
 - Rules are not optional any more, because empty

 - Adding option group for a specific datastore (mysql, redis);

If we try to delete an rbd volume that has 'watchers' on it
i.e. client connections that have not yet been closed
possibly because a client crashed, the remove() will throw an
ImageBusy exception. We now catch this exception and raise
VolumeIsBusy with a useful message.

If the volume delete fails in this way it will now stay as
'available' instead of going to 'error_deleting' so that the
delete can be retried (since it is expected to work on a
retry after waiting for the connection to timeout).

During long stress runs the WMI query that is looking for
the iSCSI device number can incorrectly return no data.
If the query is retried the appropriate data can then be
obtained.

This commit adds a retry loop, calling
basevolumeutils.get_device_number_for_target to avoid this situation.
It also handles the case where the devices list returned in
get_device_number_for_target is empty.  The retry loop is
implemented with new mounted_disk_query_retry_count and
mounted_disk_query_retry_interval configuration options.

Unit tests have been added to check the good and bad paths for
get_mounted_disk_from_lun.

Currently, a snapshot operation always produces a preallocated
disk type. When the snapshot is uploaded to glance, the source
image metadata is uploaded with the new snapshot and then some
of the metadata properties are updated. The update doesn't
include the disk_type property, this can be problematic. If
the original image has a sparse disk type and a snapshot is
taken, then the snapshot which is a preallocated disk type is
uploaded to glance with the disk_type property set to sparse,
which creates a disk type mismatch and causes errors when a vm
is spawned from that snapshot. This patch addresses the issue
by correcting the image metadata used when uploading a snapshot
to glance.

Also, the image_upload function in vmwareapi/fake.py has been
modified to address the change. Any function call to
image_upload (from the unit tests) will assert that the
metadata for the image to be uploaded must have the disk_type
value to be preallocated.

Fixes bug 1286187

Neither execute_get_output() nor execute() would wait for the process to
fully finish executing. This could potentially create a race condition
where commands execute in a different order than intended.

Also, for execute() it could cause a process to never finish executing if
it generates enough output to block writing to the pipe.

being set on the new object, so the result was a normal object with

There was already a mechanism by which middlewares could modify COPY
requests; this commit extends that so they can set headers on the new

db_plugin.delete_ports() can lead to long transaction
if plugin.deleete_port talks with external system.
This commit removes a transaction in delete_ports and
allows NEC plugin to use more granular db transactions
in delete_port. It greatly helps db race conditions and
timeouts in delete_port operations.

To avoid to impact other plugins/drivers by changing
db_plugin.delete_ports directly and to land this patch soon,
this commit overrides delete_ports() in NEC plugin.
Further disssion on transaction in delete_ports will be
discussed under bug 1282925.

In order to prepare for moving the API part of booting instances to BDM
objects, this patch removes block device mapping from being sent to the
conductor when booting instances.

There are several reasons for this - when starting several instances, we
would really need to send a list of lists of block devices, as they are
unique per instance once we switch to objects (they have the database
ID), but this information is not useful for scheduling (they are only
sent as part of request_spec dict), so it's wasteful. Also, once the
request gets to a compute service, it will disregard the block devices
it received in the request_spec and get instance specific block devices
from the database, as it needs to update them and has to have the correct
DB id's.

Also it is a step towards decoupling the data that is passed to the
scheduler from the Nova internal bookkeeping.

Port from nova https://review.openstack.org/#/c/26020/

We added a field to the table of service to log a reason when a
service has been disabled.

We added a new API extension called os-extended-services.

The new extension will extend the os-services extension adding a
method for disabling a service and specify a reason for that:
PUT /v2/{tenant_id}/os-services/disable-log-reason

When the os-extended-extension is loaded the call:
GET /V2/{tenant_id}/os-services
will return the list of services with disable reason information
if that exists.

Related-to: BP wider-aggregate-range

Certain DB functions required by the selectable aggregates
feature (e.g. stddev_pop) are not supported by sqlite.

In order to allow scenario tests exercising this functionality to
be run against mongodb in the normal case, or even against mysql,
we need to gracefully skip the test when run against sqlite.

This is achieved by means of a decorator applied to the
corresponding method on the sqlalchemy driver. The decorator
peeks ahead in the generator and maps exceptions matching some
criteria, allowing certain OperationalErrors to be mapped to
NotImplementedError, which in turn causes the test to be
skipped as required.

The behavior of the code being replaced was failing
with '-o errexit' should that, as in the common case,
the image has not been uploaded into Glance.

While we could workaround this using a '|| :', the existing
code also happened to overwrite the DOCKER_IMAGE global
which is used elsewhere. It seemed prudent to either change
this variable name or remove it altogether.

Finally, using 'glance image-show' is more deterministic
than grepping the output of 'glance image-list'.

Implement an EC2 Controller that returns a V3 token when invoked
via the V3 pipeline. Moved all code except the `authenticate` method
into a common base class mixin. `authenticate()` has become an
abstract method. Shared code from `authenticate()` was moved into
`_authenticate()`.

V3 specific router definition added that makes use of the new V3
specific controller.

For upgrade purposes:
* The paste.ini for keystone will need to be modified to include
  the new V3 ec2credentials in the pipeline as is documented in
  the updated sample paste.ini.
* Policy.json updated to provide rules for the new V3 EC2credential
  CRUD as show in the updated sample policy.json and
  policy.v3cloudsample.json

For authentication that occurs via the V3 ec2credential system,
the response auth_method (encoded in the token) will be
""ec2credential"". This should have no impact on using
or consuming the token itself but can be used to identify if
the token was issued via the Ec2ControllerV3.authenticate
method.

The V2 version of ec2credential controller has been marked
as deprecated to keep in line with the rest of the V2 API
being deprecated (slated for removal in K).

Because libvirt lvm volumes are based on instance['name'], it means
that the actual names used in lvm storage are based on an operator
configuration variable: instance_name_template (default is
'instance-%08x').

However this is site changeable, and changeable at any time. This
creates 2 failure modes.

1. Operator changes this, the result is all volumes created before the
change are no longer able to be cleaned up by nova

2. Operator has changed this to something that includes end user
input, like %(display_name), which would allow one user to impact
another (user A has display name ""bob"", user B has display name
""bob_joe"")

This changes the lvm backend to use instance['uuid'] as it's
identifier which we know is unique, non overlapping, and not
changeable based on whims of site policy.

It also provides limited backwards compatibility for cleaning up old
disks if the installation was using the default template (which is
safe), otherwise it logs a warning about possibly leaking a disk which
will need to be manually cleaned up. That should be removed once we
open the Juno tree.

UpgradeImpact - while there is no operator action required to upgrade
over this change, if the nova install included a non default value for
instance_name_template then old lvm volumes will need to be cleaned up
manually after old guests are destroyed.

test code doesn't need it widely. If we keep it on the list of

which is caused by the out-dated tablib module doesn't support python 3.

This patch removes the cliff-tablib and fixes the corresponding problem
of '-f json' to support py33 unit test, note that '-f json' needs
cliff-tablib for json formatter support, and this is the only part
cliff-tablib is needed.

Note that this patch only aims at enabling py33 virtual environment
setup, there are still lots of import errors block py33 unit test, which
will be fixed in other patches.

This patch introduce the use of apache::vhost instead of
Apache configuration file produced from template.

This methods has two advantages:
- apache class stops thinking its files have been changed and do not
  trigger a full reload of the httpd service
- the ability to maintain different vhost on the same apache
- simplicity, espcially regarding SSL

It also avoid the use of 0.0.0.0 as bind IP since it prevents the
use of IPv6.

This patch doesn't fix any blocker bugs and introduces a lot of experimental
changes that will raise questions. The patch will probably be refactored.
I39b52b2bc51ba04d59de81dc45b5a4ad82d0dc2c is similar but already have

The current client creates new .Session() on each request,
but since Horizon is a stateless app, each Session creates
new HttpAdapter, which itself has its own connection pool,
and each connection there is used (almost) once and then
is being kept in the pool(with Keep-Alive) for a certain
amount of time(waiting for inactivity timeout). The problem
is that the connection cannot be used anymore from next Django
calls - they create new connection pool with new connections, etc.
This keeps lots of open connections on the server.

Now the client will store an HTTPAdapter for each URL into
a singleton object, and will reuse its connections between
Django calls, but still taking advantage of Sessions during
a single page load(although we do not fully use this).

Note: the default pool behavior is non-blocking, which means
that if the max_pool_size is reached, a new connection will
still be opened, and when released - will be discarded.
It could be useful to add max_pool_size param into settings,
for performance fine-tuning. The default max_pool_size is 10.

Since python-novaclient is also used from non-Django projects,
I'd expect feedback from more people on the impact this change
could have over other projects.

Patch Set 3: Removed explicit connection closing, leaving
connections open in the pool.

Precursor-to: BP decoupled-source-sink-discoverable-resources

Add the concept of per-AgentManager resource discovery extensions
loaded via stevedore entry points. The extensions are loaded from
a single namespace:

  ceilometer.discover

shared by all agents. An agent may have a list of per-agent default
discovery extensions associated with it on creation. This is used
by the compute agent, which currently uses a single discovery extension
for all matching pipelines.

The per-pipeline statically configured resources remain in place to
potentially override the per-agent discovered resources - these will
be augmented by per-pipeline discovery in a subsequent patch.

Recast the compute agent's interrogation of the nova servers API
in the form of a discovery extension.

Unify the pollster abstraction used by the central and compute
agents (which had previously diverged along with the introduction
of per-pipeline resources).

Unify the polling task logic used by the central and compute
agents (so that the compute agent now iterates over each pollster
for all local instances, as opposed to interating over all
pollsters for each local instance).

1. Move the scenario args validation process to the benchmark engine,
   just before the ScenarioRunner class gets instantiated.
2. Add support for different validation strategies:
    a) admin - run using admin clients;
    b) user - run using user clients:
        - In case of pre created users - run for all of them;
        - In case of tmp users - run only from one
          (that will be created specially for this case inside benchmark.engine)

The actual definition of the desired validation stragery should be done by the
@validation.requires_permission(...) decorator, which signals the BenchmarkEngine
which clients to pass to the validation method, e.g.:

    @validation.requires_permission(consts.EndpointPermission.ADMIN)
    def some_validator(clients, **kwargs):
        """"""BenchmarkEngine will guarantee that this validator gets supplied with
           an admin client; it will skip this validator if no admin client can be
           created.""""""

This patch also renames self.temp_users in ScenarioRunner and subclasses to just
self.users, thus reflecting the fact that the users may not be temporarily created
but passed to the ScenarioRunner as precreated ones.

The default glance_control_exchange in Ceilometer has been changed
from 'glance_notifications' to 'glance' in grizzly-2. Glance always
had 'glance' for its control_exchange.

This was a bug in Ceilometer and puppet-ceilometer patched it.
It shouldn't anymore.

Currently _refresh_neutron_extensions_cache() always authenticates
with Neutron using the configured Neutron admin credentials because
it doesn't have access to the calling context.  But it's actually
always called when a valid context exists, and the call to get the
list of extensions is not itself an admin operation.  By passing
the context down we can avoid this additional authentication step.
