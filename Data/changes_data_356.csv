- Fix .ssh/config file mapping
- Move private key from nova-compute-ssh container to nova-compute
  container.
- Map private and public keys to configmap-ssh which will default to
  the appropriate file permissions.
- Add additional config to /etc/ssh/sshd_config to allow passwordless
  root logins over appropriate subnet passed in from overrides.
- Remove chmods from sshd bash script as they are failing.

Depends on helm-toolkit supporting multiple containers per daemonset
pod.

Neutron is looking for 'tenant_id' in the response from the proxy plugin.
This patch makes sure the 'project_id' returned from octavia is copied over
to the 'tenant_id' in the response to neutron or assigns the one from the
context.

This patch also adapts Octavia's 403 Forbidden errors to neutron's 404 [1].
[1] https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/pike/contributor/internals/ \
    policy.html#request-authorization

Neutron is also returning a 404 instead of a status ""DELETED"". This
adjusts that.

Neutron/tempest will ask for the tenant_id field - replace this with
project_id.

In order to make this role work with pure/clean images and also with
altered images like the ones provided by infra we need to detect
which virtualenv executable is available.

On clean fedora28 systems virtualenv is installed by python3-virtualend
package and provideds virtualenv-3 command.

On infra images, virtualenv is installed manually and disabled as rpm
and we do no thave an virtualenv-3 executable. Still, we can expect
to have a working virtualenv on.

On CentOS-7, there is no python-pip package, its correct name is
python2-pip.

We have jsonschema capped at a fairly old version. Other than some
specific releases, it looks like keeping it below 3.0 was added in
I943fd68b9fab3bce1764305a5058df5339470757 without really any explanation
why.

In order to update to a 3.x release we need to:
1. Remove the cap from global-requirements.txt (see Depends-On), leaving
   upper-constraints.txt at a 2.x release
2. Remove the cap from all consumers (this change)
3. Release a new version of consumers that are published to pypi
4. Update upper-constraints.txt with those new releases
5. Update jsonschema in upper-constraints.txt to a 3.X release
   (See: https://review.openstack.org/649789)
6. Test consumers with the change from 5.
7. [Optional] fix issues in consumers that arise from 6.
8. Merge the change from 5.

Ovs-agent can process the ports in large sets, then all
of these ports will have to update DB status or attributes.
But neutron server is centralized. It may have to do
something else, or the database processing can be also
time-consuming. Because of these, it sometimes returns
the RPC timeout exception to ovs-agent. And a fullsync
will be triggered in next rpc loop. The restart time is
becoming longer and longer.

Adds a default step to update the port to reduce
the probability of RPC timeout.

Removing an active or a standby HA router from an agent that has a
valid DVR serviceable port (such as DHCP), does not remove the
HA interface associated with the Router in the SNAT namespace.

When we try to add the HA router back to the agent, then it
adds more than one HA interface to the SNAT Namespace causing
more problems and we sometimes also see multiple active routers.

This bug might have been introduced by this patch [1].

Fix the problem by just adding the router namespaces without HA
interfaces when there is no HA and re-insert the HA interfaces
when HA router is bound to the agent into the namespace.

The oslopolicy-policy-generator command line tool does not run
currently, throwing a KeyError.  This is because a policy enforcer needs
to be added to Neutron for the command to run.

This change is a limited backport of ""Convert policy.json into
policy-in-code"" [1]. The feature of policy-in-code is not backported;
all that is backported is the changes needed for the
oslopolicy-policy-generator command line tool to function properly,
which were bundled in with the rest of the policy-in-code feature.

For reference, an analogous change was merged in keystone to solve the
same problem [2].

resource in stack from local OpenStack cloud.

I propose we add multi cloud support into ``OS::Heat::Stack`` and change the
property schema for ``context``. Within context, we should adding
following properties:

* credential_secret_id: ID of Barbican Secret. Which stores authN
  information for remote cloud.

Service will use auth information from Barbican Secret to access
 Orchestration service in another OpenStack.
Must make sure you're able toget that secret from Barbican service when

The designate pool manager needs to be restarted on all designate
units when the update pools command is run with a new version of
the pools yaml.

Previously it was assumed that it was sufficient to trigger a new
hook execution but in the following scenario the update is missed:

1) Non-leader reacts to a change in pools and renders a new
   pools.yaml but does not run the db update as it is not the leader
2) leader reacts to a change in pools, renders a new pools.yaml,
   updates the db and finally sets pool-yaml-hash with the new
   value to trigger hooks executions on peers.
3) Non-leader reacts to leader db change, re-renders pools.yaml with
   the same values as step 1 and does not perform the pool manager
   restart even though it is needed.

The above scenario is fixed by adding a handler looking for a
change in the pool-yaml-hash and restarting the pool manager if it
changes. The leadership layer is needed to get the flags raised on
leader db changes.

The leader can also fail to restart pool manager as services are
restarted as soon as the config is rendered and before the
update_pools call is made. This scenario is fixed by adding a
handler to look for a change in the pools.yaml and restart pool
manager if it changes. This works because update pools is run in
the same handler as config render which means the new handler runs
after this render & update handler.

Dnsmasq driver used by dhcp agent has restart() method which is
calling disable() and then enable() dnsmasq process again.
What can be observed in functional tests from time to time it may
happen that start dnsmasq process will be called before old process
is really down. That leads to error that IP address to which
dnsmasq wants to bind is already in use and it fails to start.

This patch adds possibility to call disable() method with block flag
set to True. In such case driver will ensure in disable() method that
process is really not active.
This blocking disable() is used in restart() method now.

It is possible for a row in Cassandra to have a missing metric_id
(shows as 'null' in cqlsh).  This causes an ugly NoneType error
to be passed up to the user on the command line for
'monaca metric-list'.

Fix is to detect the missing value, log an error, and return the
row with None for the metric_id.

When merging port ranges, the code never assumed the
conjunction ID might not be present in the set due to
already being removed.

In this case there were two security groups, both using
the same remote security group, but the first security
group does not define a port range and the second one does.
Or more generally, the first SG port range is a subset
of the second, as no port-range means the full range.

As of Rocky [1], the nova-consoleauth service has been deprecated and
cell databases are used for storing token authorizations. All new consoles
will be supported by the database backend and existing consoles will be
reset. Console proxies must be run per cell because the new console token
authorizations are stored in cell databases.

Lets deprecate it also in tripleo that it can be removed in a later
release.

When running 'nova-manage simple_cell_setup...' if there are not hosts
to map, but there remaining instances to map, an '..., exiting' message
is produced. This is misleading because ""exiting"" implies a return of
control to the user. That doesn't happen if there are many instances
left to inspect or map.

This change gets around that by getting rid of the exiting message
in the case where instance mapping can still happen.

Move some of the user intro documentation around so that the
README.rst file can be use to publish packages to PyPI. The :ref: role
for linking between pages in Sphinx is not available for use in readme
files, so most of the content is moved into the main documentation.

We have jsonschema capped at a fairly old version. Other than some
specific releases, it looks like keeping it below 3.0 was added in
I943fd68b9fab3bce1764305a5058df5339470757 without really any explanation
why.

In order to update to a 3.x release we need to:
1. Remove the cap from global-requirements.txt (see Depends-On), leaving
   upper-constraints.txt at a 2.x release
2. Remove the cap from all consumers (this change)
3. Release a new version of consumers that are published to pypi
4. Update upper-constraints.txt with those new releases
5. Update jsonschema in upper-constraints.txt to a 3.X release
   (See: https://review.openstack.org/649789)
6. Test consumers with the change from 5.
7. [Optional] fix issues in consumers that arise from 6.
8. Merge the change from 5.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect

will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/stein branch, tests will
continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

Recently in fullstack tests it was noticed that sometimes it may
happend that those arguments are separated with space char and this
caused failed test because async_process.AsyncProcess() was not able
to check that process is really active.

This patch adds attempt to split cmdline arguments with space in case
when split with '\0' returns only 1 element.

In some cases deleted snapshots and connections are not removed form the
cached lists, so we end up with a non existent element in the
""snapshots"" or ""connections"" list that should not be there.

The reason why this happens is because we are looking for specific
instances instead of searching by the ID of the resource, and we could
have different instances in the list than the one we are looking for.

This patch ensure we are always looking for the elements to remove using
the ID.

The oslopolicy-policy-generator command line tool does not run
currently, throwing a KeyError.  This is because a policy enforcer needs
to be added to Neutron for the command to run.

This change is a limited backport of ""Convert policy.json into
policy-in-code"" [1]. The feature of policy-in-code is not backported;
all that is backported is the changes needed for the
oslopolicy-policy-generator command line tool to function properly,
which were bundled in with the rest of the policy-in-code feature.

For reference, an analogous change was merged in keystone to solve the
same problem [2].
