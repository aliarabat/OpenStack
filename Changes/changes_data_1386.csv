To improve forward-compatibility (old Swift versions being able to read
rings serialized by new Swift verisons), rings continue to be serialized
with Python pickle by default.

The new format (much more efficiently deserialized than pickled rings
written by Python 2.7) may be selected by passing a ""version=1"" kwarg to
swift.common.ring.ring.RingData.save() or by including an optional
trailing argument of ""1"" to swift-ring-builder's ""rebalance"" and
""write_ring"" commands.  In both cases, the argument itself is optional
and defaults to version 0 (pickling).

The new code continues to be able to load rings serialized in either
format.

Keep the compute host's ComputeNode model in sync with the
level of resource usage.  This enables the ComputeNode
model to be used as a basis for scheduling decisions
rather than forcing scheduler to calculate free
resources from an instance_get_all on each request.

Resources like memory and disk are claimed as instances are built
or deleted.  There is also support for configurable compute node
stats (a generic key/value store) for extensible advertising of other
usage stats that may be useful for a particular scheduler
implementation.  Additionally, there is a periodic task on the
compute host that audits actual resource consumption at the virt
layer to ensure that the database stays in sync.

This change partially implements blueprint: scheduler-resource-race

This patch complements:

There were two issues here.

1. There was a global object stored for all instances,
thus the last mounted instance was always unmounted.

2. Even if there was only a single LXC instance in use,
the global object would be lost on restart of Nova.

Therefore we reset the internal state for the mount object,
by passing in the mount point to destroy_container(),
and querying the device in use for that mount point.

Fixes bug 1036902 -- Backported version for stable/essex.

There are a number of cases where block storage connections are not
properly restored, impacting libvirt in particular. The most common
case is a VM which has block storage attached via iSCSI, whereby the
physical system is rebooted. When the system comes back up and
starts nova-compute, the iSCSI connections are NOT recreated for the
instances slated to be resumed (assuming
resume_guests_state_on_host_boot is set).

The patch changes the compute manager to pass block_storage_info via
driver.reboot() and driver.resume_state_on_host_boot(). The fix is
actually only present in the libvirt driver. However, all the other
drivers were updated to accept the additional, optional function
arg.

With the changes in place, iSCSI connections for libvirt are
re-established after a hypervisor reboot with
resume_guests_state_on_host_boot=True and on every hard_reboot.
The latter is intended so that users have a last ditch option for
recovering their VMs without administrative involvement.

This patch updates the /servers API and the disk config
extension so that they properly handle incorrectly formatted
server update/PUT requests.

Includes a new test cause that verifies (with extensions enabled)
that a poorly formatted PUT request to /servers returns HTTP 422
instead of a 500.

Also updated the previous test_create_missing_server test to use
test.TestException instead of Exception.

Fixes LP Bug #1038227.

Commit 5ad1dea4 added changed the network deallocation code to
work with deleted instances. This was done by setting the context
to read deleted records. Unfortunately this was done a little too
broadly, leading to a new bug where a deleted floating_ip will
cause an instance to not be able to be deleted.

This fixes the issue by limiting the use of read_deleted context
to only the places it is trying to access the instance record. It
adds a test  to verify that the code works with a duplicate
deleted floating_ip and updates the existing test for a deleted
instance to exercise the entire code path.

This was something we identified when c6be78deb6a3a7cbf092efdfb54f561ce689605f
caused some regressions which prohibited the Nova metadata server from making
this call. We have subsequently fixed the metadata server by correcting
admin context access to this function.... however using an explicit policy rule
(and not relying on the default) seems like a good idea as well.

Fixes bug 1036902.

There are a number of cases where block storage connections are not
properly restored, impacting libvirt in particular. The most common
case is a VM which has block storage attached via iSCSI, whereby the
physical system is rebooted. When the system comes back up and
starts nova-compute, the iSCSI connections are NOT recreated for the
instances slated to be resumed (assuming
resume_guests_state_on_host_boot is set).

The patch changes the compute manager to pass block_storage_info via
driver.reboot() and driver.resume_state_on_host_boot(). The fix is
actually only present in the libvirt driver. However, all the other
drivers were updated to accept the additional, optional function
arg.

With the changes in place, iSCSI connections for libvirt are
re-established after a hypervisor reboot with
resume_guests_state_on_host_boot=True and on every hard_reboot.
The latter is intended so that users have a last ditch option for
recovering their VMs without administrative involvement.

the multi host HA option, it doesn't work so well.

This change provides an example to make this clearer.

_make_app_iter_reader uses a queue to pass read data to
_make_app_iter, and uses an empty string as a terminator.  The problem
is that it pushes the same terminator even if it fails to reads the
data.  If an exception happens before pushing all data to the queue,
_make_app_iter exits without yielding all data.  In that case,
proxy-server stops in the middle of sending data, and a client waits
for all data to come infinitely.

This patch uses a boolean value for the terminator instead of an empty
string to distinguish the results, and raises an exception in the
error cases.  Fixes bug 890888.

Using reset for hard_reboot is not reliable, even where it is supported
by libvirt. Hard reboots are one of the only ways to recover a VM in a
broken state. The reset command assumes the domain is running in some
capacity and will fail if it is not.

Hard reset is the current sledgehammer for fixing issues and it really
needs to stay that way.

Our new lockfile code works fine if the locks already exist, but
it is annoying to pollute the source tree with lockfiles in the
tests.

This modifies the lockfile code slightly to use a tempdir if
lock_path is none. Note that a tempdir will not work in production
but it is fine for testing. We set the lock_path to None in the
testing flags.

Also removes the explicit cleanup in run_tests.sh. The new solution
works with tox and will work even if we add new locks.

Commit d39137fa added the functionality to the ComputeFilter to filter
on architecture, hypervisor_type, and vm_mode.  The existing ArchFilter
already filtered on architecture.  This patch merges the ComputeFilter
functionality introduced in d39137fa with the ArchFilter.  An alternative
would have been to remove the ArchFilter, but there is a desire to keep
the compute filters simple and only have ComputeFilter filter on whether
the compute node is enabled.

This patch also adds the ArchFilter to the list of default filters
specified by the scheduler_default_filters FLAG.

migration to reverse it.

The motivation for reversion is that the per-user quota logic would

See bug 1034384, bug 1037590.

This reverts commit https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/391f345d,
but leaves the DB migration in place while adding a further
migration to reverse it.

The motivation for reversion is that the per-user quota logic would
totally undermine the per-project quotas set for a pre-existing
openstack install.

The per-user quota logic could be re-introduced in a fixed state
after Folsom-3.

Currently a request for multiple instances issent to the scheduler,
where it is written to the database. It appears that this was done so
that more advanced schedulers could handle the request as one
batch, but the result is the scheduler is sometimes slow enough
that the call will timeout.

Instead this converts to always creating the instance records
locally and making run_instance into a casting instead of a call.

This made a small change to the rpc api for run instance, so the
version was bumped. Legacy messages are still handled properly.

Given the backend location from Glance, drivers can determine
whether they can clone or otherwise efficiently create a volume
from the image without downloading all the data from Glance.

For now implement cloning for the RBD driver. There's already a
Glance backend that stores images as RBD snapshots, so they're
ready to be cloned into volumes. Fall back to copying all the
data if cloning is not possible.

Updates the disk config extension to check for 'server' in the
request body before trying to use it. This avoids a potential
KeyError exception. Given that we already validate the 'server'
dict in servers.py and raise a proper exception there this seems
reasonable to me... no reason to duplicate all of the validation
logic.

The reason this change was able to make it into Nova to begin
with is that the Extensions loader orders things differently
depending on the OS/python version being used. I tested this
by running SchedulerHintsTestCase.test_create_missing_server
on both Fedora 16 (passes) and Fedora 17 (fails). The problem
only manifests itself when the disk config extension gets called
before the scheduler_hints extension. To fix this issue
I've updated the scheduler_hints extensions in this patchset
to simply pass when 'server' isn't defined which like above seems
reasonable because we already validate this in servers.py.

As part of this fix I'm also moving test_create_missing_server out
of the Scheduler Hints tests and into a new ServersAllExtensionsTestCase
class in test_servers.py which explicitly tests for things with *all*
extensions enabled. As part of the move I also updated the test to
look for HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity which is what we throw when
'server' doesn't exist in a POST to servers (the correct exception).

partial fix for bug 1004328

Only the xen hypervisor actually respects the device name that
is passed in attach_volume. For other hypervisors it makes much
more sense to automatically generate a unique name.

This patch generates a non-conflicting device name if one is not
passed to attach_volume. It also validates the passed in volume
name to make sure another device isn't already attached there.

A corresponding change to novaclient and horizon will greatly
improve the user experience of attaching a volume.

It moves some common code out of metadata/base so that it can
be used to get a list of block devices. The code was functionally
tested as well and block device name generation works properly.

This adds a new method to the rpcapi to validate a device name. It
also adds server_id to the volumes extension, since it was omitted
by mistake.

The next step is to modify the libvirt driver to match the serial
number of the device to the volume uuid so that the volume can
always be found at /dev/disk/by-id/virtio-<uuid>.

This change adds checks in the ComputeFilter to verify compute hosts can
support the (architecture, hypervisor_type, vm_mode) triple specified
in the instance properties, improving support for heterogeneous clouds.

Images can be marked with the architecture, hypervisor, and virtual
machine mode they require, e.g.

glance image-update --property architecture=x86_64 \
  --property hypervisor_type=kvm <image-uuid>
glance image-update --property architecture=i686 \
  --property hypervisor_type=xen --property vm_mode=xen <image-uuid>
glance image-update --property architecture=x86_64 \
  --property hypervisor_type=xen --property vm_mode=hvm <image-uuid>

These properties are included in the request_spec part of the run_instance
RPC message and made available to the ComputeFilter.  The ComputeFilter
will only pass compute nodes that satisfy the specified properties.
If no properties are specified, the ComputeFilter behavior is unchanged.

Adding these checks to the compute filter seems consistent with its
definition [1]:

""ComputeFilter - checks that the capabilities provided by the compute
service satisfy the extra specifications, associated with the instance
type.""

The direct_url is only available in the v2 images API, so add a
version parameter to each request. As more parts of the v2 API are
used, this parameter will become more useful.

This continues the work Michael did on blueprint config-drive-v2

Things added:
 * web service /openstack/2012-08-10 with:
   user_data
   meta_data.json
 * web service supporting /openstack/content

Things changed:
 * Changed the name 'files' (/openstack/files) to be 'content'
   This is to be more generic and apply to future re-use of it
   for some purpose other than personalities (injected_files)
 * 'meta_data.json' and 'user_data' are used for openstack
 * 'user-data' (without .raw) in the ec2 config drive rendering
 * 'content_path' is a attribute of each of the entries in the 'files'
   its value is the path from the openstack metadata service root to
   where the content is located.

   This means that the user does not have to know anything explicit about
   '/content'.  They just have to take the 'content_path' and append it
   to the top level entry point of metadata service.

   Explicit example:
   http://169.254.169.254/openstack/2012-08-10/meta_data.json
   has:
     files[{path: ""/etc/passwd"", content_path: ""/content/0001""}]
   To get the file, user appends 'content_path' to
     http://169.254.169.254/openstack
 * network config (Template) is available in /content also, and
   the key that points to it is 'network_config'. This occurs only
   if there are network's that are ""injected"" (same behavior as previously)

The meta_data.json now contains
  uuid: <instance uuid>
  meta: meta tags provided they will appear in a dict here
  files:
     This is a list of dicts, where each dict has 2 fields:
       * 'path' (the path provided)
       * 'content_id': the location in /content/ that will give the content
  public-keys:
     Dict of keyname : value
  network_config:
     This is a dict, containing 'content_path' and 'name' (network_config)
  hostname: the hostname
  name: the nova boot name

TODO:
 * want to add other items into openstack metadata
   * public-hostname
   * IP addresses
   * keystone-endpoint
   * url of metadata service: ideally only show this if there
     is a web service available.  the path seems hard coded at the moment
     to be http://169.254.169.254/openstack, but I do not know if there
     is a way to determine if one is present or not.

physical network names and physical interfaces, replaces the

Also, all remnants of the V1 quantum API have been removed, so the

Fixes bug 1036153

If a user has admin role, network list returned by Quantum API contains
networks that does not belong to that tenant. As a result networks owned
by other tenants are listed in ""Network"" tab of ""Launch Intance"" menu.
Thus we need to specify tenant_id when calling network_list() to
retrieve only the networks available for the tenant.

In addition this commit added a validation logic to syspanel instance
launching workflow. It checks whether the owner tenant of the requested
network(s) matches the tenant specified in the launching panel.

Right now, the task_state logic in compute/api.py can be broken, such
that instances can get stuck in an uneditable state if an action is
performed that fails. The task_state remains something like 'stopping'
even though the action has not been completed or queued, and further
requests that depend on task_state will fail (see check_instance_state()
in compute/apy.py).

The only way out of it is to delete the instance or hack the database.

This patch adds a reverts_task_state() decorator to compute/manager.py,
which, upon operation failure, reverts the instance's task_state back
to None.

It also adds a test_state_revert() test to verify that all the actions
marked for state reversion do the right thing. It also corrects several
other tests that specifically expect the task_state to remain after
an error has occurred.

In an upcoming release, rbd will support creating volumes from
snapshots ('cloning'). To clone a snapshot, it must first be
'protected', which means it cannot be deleted until it is unprotected.
A snapshot can only be unprotected if no clones depend on it. Thus,
translate a failure to unprotect into a SnapshotIsBusy exception.

Also check for remaining snapshots before deleting a volume,
and raise VolumeIsBusy if any exist. While we're here, tidy up
the shell arguments to be more readable.

This is backwards compatible since it does not use the new features
unless they are available in the installed version of rbd.

blueprint quantum-api-quotas

We implement it as an extension for linux bridge and ovs plugins.
We also expose the /quotas/Xx url to client to operate the quota.
We need admin role to show other tenant's quota, and to update quota data.
Any user can show its own tenant's quota. An DB table is used to save the
quota for each tenant.

To use it, we have in quantum.conf:
quota_driver = quantum.extensions._quotav2_driver.DbQuotaDriver

The default quotas for each tenant are defined in quantum.conf too.

In addition, modify extension framework to allow exposing a new resource and
its controler. The extension can check the environment, such as configuration
in global cfg.CONF to decide if it can be enabled.

Also, we can define enabled extensions for each plugin in extensions.py
New resources can be put into quota framework via quota_items in nova.conf

Fixes LP 1030010.

Close off a back-door allowing users to go over-quota on ram
and/or cores by creating a tiny instance and then resizing
to any size regardless of the remaining usage headroom.

The quota management logic is distributed in the sense that
the reservations are passed with the RPC casts that may fail
silently, so that the rollback or commit is handled by the
actor finalizing the resize/confirmation/reversion.

Up-sizing requires there is sufficient quota headroom upfront
to accommodate the larger size, whereas conversely down-sizing
only results in a usage reduction when the resize is confirmed.

Enhances provider extension to support flat networks and VLANs on
multiple physical networks. Implements blueprint provider-networks.

To create a flat network using the CLI with admin rights:

net-create --tenant_id <tenant-id> <net-name> --provider:network_type flat --provider:physical_network <physical-network>

To create a VLAN network using the CLI with admin rights:

net-create --tenant_id <tenant-id> <net-name> --provider:network_type vlan --provider:physical_network <physical-network> --provider:vlan_id <vlan-id>

The provider extension is supported by the linuxbridge and openvswitch
plugins and their agents [openvswitch phase 2 implementation is
in-progress, and does not yet support flat networks or multiple
interfaces].

Ranges of VLANs available on named physical networks for normal
allocation are specified in the plugin's config file via the
ListOpt syntax:

network_vlan_ranges = <physical_network>:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>

The mapping of each named physical network to its physical network
interface is specified (per-agent-host) in the agent's config file via
the ListOpt syntax:

physical_interface_mappings = <physical_network>:<physical_interface>

See quantum/plugins/linuxbridge/README for details and examples of
network_vlan_ranges and physical_interface_mappings usage.

Also, bulk operations are enabled for the linuxbridge plugin.

swift.common.ring.ring.RingData is now responsible for serialization and
deserialization of its data via a new load() class method and save()

does not begin with a new-style magic string, it is assumed to be an
old-style pickle-dumped ring and is handled as before.  So new Swift
code can read old rings, but old Swift code will not be able to read
newly-serialized rings. THIS SHOULD BE MENTIONED PROMINENTLY IN THE

The current implementation interprets set_default('foo', None) and
set_override('foo', None) as 'clear the existing default or override',
which makes it impossible to override a value with None.

This patch adds support for overriding with a None value by adding
a special internal class. set_override('foo', None) will now override
the existing value with None. This is a slight change to the existing
behavior, so this patch adds two calls for the old functionality of
clearing defaults and overrides. Example syntax for the new calls
are shown below:

conf.clear_default('foo')
conf.clear_override('foo')

The patch also updates the tests to reflect the change in functionality
and adds new tests to verify the new functionality.

Implements blueprint quantum-v2-public-networks

This patch allows Quantum to handle public networks. It modifies the
API adding a new attribute to the network resource ('shared')
and enhances the policy engine in order to handle the behaviour of
the service wrt shared networks.
Policy.json specifies a default behaviour which can be changed by
the administrator, even at runtime.
Tests added to test_db_plugin validate 'obvious' behaviour - such as
that only the ports belonging to a given tenant should be returned
even when they are queried on a public network.
Tests added to test_policy instead validate the changes added to the
policy engine.

This is in preparation for cinder blueprint
efficient-volumes-from-images. If the same rbd cluster is used by
glance and cinder, a new volume can be created as a copy-on-write
clone by the ceph cluster rather than downloading all the data from
glance.

Since bp api-v2-store-access is implemented, make the location for the
rbd store more specific, so cinder can check that it's accessing the
same backend as glance. fsid is a unique identifier for a Ceph cluster.

Within a cluster, the full specification of an rbd image includes
pool, image name, and optionally snapshot. Creating a copy-on-write
clone is only possible in rbd on a protected snapshot, so after
uploading an image to rbd, create a snapshot and protect
it. Protection means it can't be deleted until it is unprotected, so
you can't accidentally render any clones unusable by removing their
parent. Add a new exception, InUseByStore, to handle a snapshot or
image that's still protected or otherwise in use.

More details can be found at
http://ceph.com/docs/master/dev/rbd-layering/.

For backwards compatibility, only use these new features if they are
supported by the installed librados and librbd python bindings. Otherwise
fallback to the previous location specifier which only includes image
id, since cloning won't work anyway.

Since the location parsing is now a bit more complicated, add unit
tests for it.

Fixes bug 1034401

When a compute service is restarted each instance running on the
host has its iptables rules built and applied sequentially during
the host init stage. The impact of this, especially on a host
running many instances, can be observed as a period where some
instances are not accessible as the existing iptables rules have
been torn down and not yet re-applied.

The presented work-around for this is a configurable/flagged deferred
mode that prevents the application of the iptables rules until all
instances on the host had been initialised then the rules for all
instances are applied all at once preventing a 'blackout' period.

This is the first cut of config drive v2. Some points to note:

 - implements a helper to create new-style config drives. These
   config drives can be VFAT or ISO9660, this is controlled by
   a flag. The current default is ISO9660.

 - the config drives contain all the injected files, as well as
   everything returned from the ec2 style metadata service. Only
   the most recent version of the ec2 metadata is used, but future
   versions will appear as well.

 - the v1 functionality of specifying an image from glance to have
   the files injected into is dropped.

 - the location for file injection is now a directory named
   openstack/files, not the root level of the filesystem. Filename
   mapping is in the openstack metadata files.

 - the default format for the config drive is iso9660, although
   the previous vfat is available with a flag change.

 - includes the first version of an openstack metadata format.

 - there are some simple unit tests which probably need more done
   to them.

Partially implements bp config-drive-v2.

When running devstack, nova moves the host ip from eth0 onto the
bridge. This causes devstack to fail on the second run unless you
explicitly set HOST_IP in localrc.

This patch searches for an ip on the interface that is used for
the default route. This will be eth0 (or en0) in most cases, but
it will search br100 instead if nova has moved the ip, since it
moves the default route as well.

It also will filter out ips from the potential list that are part
of the fixed range and floating range if the netaddr library is
installed. This allows us to find the proper ip even if we have
accidentally left a floating ip or fixed ip on the bridge.

Fixes bug 1029495

The trigger_members_refresh method in compute.api.py specifies
a group id in the call to refresh_security_group_members. This
is just the last group id seen and ignores the fact that a
refresh may impact members of multiple groups.

This is masked by the fact that on the host the group id is
ignored and all instances have their security rules refreshed
regardless of if they are part of the changed group or not.

This change modifies the logic surrounding refreshes so we send
a refresh request for each instance which is affected by a
security group change, this ensures we aren't spending time
refreshing unaffected instances and also removes the possibility
of refreshing an instance multiple times if it is a member of
more than one group.

Also changed to be instance-centric is the refresh carried out
when a rule is added/removed to a security group.

This patch adds an output extension for security group output
and modifies the servers code to only allow security groups
to be specified if the os-security-groups extension is
enabled.

Duplicated security group functionality was removed from the
createserverext extension, it is now a duplicate of the servers
endpoint. The boot_from_volume extension was also changed
to inherit the servers functionality so that security_groups
will continue to work. The block_device_mapping code will be
modified in a subsequent patch.

Tests were added for new functionality, and existing tests were
modified slightly. The disk_config extension was modified to be
a bit more lenient so the data for it doesn't need to be mocked
out in other tests.

Related to blueprint cfg-global-object

When using the global config object pattern, you often have modules
which define options that are referenced in other options.

So, for example if module A defined option 'foo' and module be needed
to reference that option, you might do:

  import A
  print CONF.foo

However, this makes it entirely unclear to the casual reader why
module A was imported.

Nova has a flags.DECLARE() function that helps with this problem
by allowing you to do:

  flags.DECLARE('foo', 'A')

The function simply imports module A and checks that the 'foo'
option is now defined in the global config object.

This is fine, but it is also implicit that this function applies
to the global config object. Instead, let's do the following:

  CONF.import_opt('foo', 'A')
