Cinder and cinderclient assumes an attachment create request will
always contain instance_uuid. This is not true when glance calls
cinder for attachment in glance cinder configuration.
This patch (along with the cinder patch) make the instance_uuid

Reason:
Earlier in tacker, VNF mgmt IP address was assigned to parameter

Train branch is in Extended Maintenance now[1]. Tempest and
tempest plugins are branchless which means master version of
Tempest and its plugins is used to test the supported stable
branches.

Once any stable branch is moved to EM state then, Tempest and
its plugins compatible tag[2] needs to be released so that we can
keep testing the EM stable branches with that tag once master
Tempest and its plugins are not compatible[3].

Tagging 'train-last'[4] as well as a new version also with same hash.

This change fixes the query being used to filter share
types. We were using an ""or"" clause instead of an ""and"" clause,
and that was causing all the extra specs to be shown instead of
the ones that the user specified. With this fix, manila users will
be able to filter shares by share type extra_specs accurately.

The tacker-horizon integration test framework has been implemented[1]
While adding integration test cases a selenium exception [2] was
observed for test cases under directory [3].

Tacker-horizon UI Details:

* Most of the Horizon plugins, such as manila-ui and vitrage-dashboard
  support integration tests, these plugins reside under ""Project"" tab.
* Whereas, tacker-horizon, mistral-dashboard are horizon plugins which
  have their dashboard anchored directly at the top-level alongside
  ""Project"" tab.
* The tacker-horizon has two-panel groups,
   * VNF Management
   * NFV Orchestration
* The ""VNF Management"" is a default panel and remains expanded in NFV
  dashboard, whereas ""NFV Orchestration"" is collapsed initially.

Selenium Exception Details:

* The horizon framework reports an exception
  ElementNotInteractableException, while opening pages under
  ""NFV Orchestration"" panel group.
* This error occurs when an element is not clicked or it is not visible
  yet.
* The menu item expansion code in the horizon integration framework
  expands only those menu items (level first, second or third) if only
  the previous menu item at the same level was expanded earlier.
* For example, in order to open a page[4] under NVF Orchestration panel
  group, the framework collapses ""Project"" tab and clicks ""NFV""
  dashboard.
  But it never expands ""NFV Orchestration"" panel as in second-level no
  such transition occured hence it remains collapsed. So test case fails
  to find desired page.
  On the other hand, test cases for pages under ""VNF Management"" succeed
  as the panel group by default remains open.

This patch adds functionality to detect collapsed menu items and expand
the items.

This release picks up new commits to zun since
the last release from stable/ussuri.

This is being proposed as a convenience to help make sure stable
changes are being released. If the team is good with this going out,
please respond with a +1 to let the release team know it is OK to
proceed.

If it is not wanted at this time, or if there are more changes that
would be good to get merged before doing a stable release, please
leave a -1 with a comment with what the team would prefer. We can
then either abandon this patch, or wait for an update with a new

This patch consits of:

* New ops interface grafana_dashboard based on the existing reactive
  interface
* New ops http interface.
* Dashboard registers grafana dashboards with grafana. These
  dashboards are taken from upstream ceph *1. Ideally the charm
  would pick these up from ceph packaging but they are currently
  not included. With the exception of host-details.json and
  hosts-overview.json the dashboards are unchanged. host-details.json
  and hosts-overview.json both needed changed to make the compatable
  with the metrics telegraf is sending.
* alertmanager-service and prometheus relations
  using the http ops interface allowing there api endpoints to be
  registered with the dashboard.

NOTE: ceph-mon has an existing relation with Prometheus (
ceph-mon:prometheus <-> prometheus:target ) but prometheus does not
publish its api endpoint on that relation. So, the dashboard adds a
prometheus:website <-> ceph-dashboard:prometheus relation. This
allows the dashboard to set set-prometheus-api-host.

In the ONTAP 9.8 and older, there is a bug in the zapi call
`snapmirror-release-iter` when using the scoped account
configuration. The operation is returning success, but the release
is not occurring.

To avoid this issue, the Netapp driver was changed to release with
the `snapmirror-release` zapi call, instead of the one that has a
bug. This new zapi call requires the field `relationship-id` to be
specified and it is being retrieved from ONTAP before calling it.

A small fix, not related to the bug, was made in the zapi call to
`snapmirror-release-iter` because the `relationship-info-only`
field was in the wrong place according to the documentation.

Issue is invalid input error being raised, even when

The reason is availability_zone is name and source_share_az
is id in the filter [1]. Now, regardless of availability_zone
provided is id or name, it will be always converted to a name.
And if availability_zone is the same as parent share's
operation will complete successfully.

The Oslo Versioned Objects history is used to generate the manifests
required to do compatibility changes to OVOs on data serialization
between services running with different OVO history versions.

We haven't updated our OVO history since Train so all the history and
compatibility code (obj_make_compatible method) is no longer necessary.

This patch consolidates the OVO history into a single version reflecting
the current status of the OVO versions and removes the compatibility
code from the OVO classes.

Since we tend to forget to update the obj_make_compatible when we add a
field (like it happened with Volume in version 1.8 when we added
shared_targets) this patch also adds a note next to the ""fields""
attribute (except for the list OVOs which are never updated).

Volume usage notifications in Cinder during Cinder volume migrations are
incorrect.

Part of a volume migration is creating a new volume on the destination
backend and during this process Cinder will issue volume usage
notifications ""create.start"" and ""create.end"" even though this is not a
user volume creation and is inconsistent with other temporary volume and
snapshot creation cases.

Also one of the latest steps during the volume creation is to delete one
of the 2 volumes (the source or the destination) and in that case Cinder
will only issue a ""delete.end"" notification without its corresponding
""delete.start"".

Since temporary volumes (for backups or migrations) are not counted
towards quota usage they should also not issue volume usage
notifications.

This patch makes sure that we don't do notifications when creating or
deleting temporary migration volumes.

In both cases it checks the migration_status field to see if it starts
with 'target:'.  For creation the migration_status is set in
_migrate_volume_generic method before making the RPC call, so the data
will be there from the start, before the manager flow starts.

A patch [1] that updates upper-constraints.txt for neutron-lib 2.14 fails
to pass check pipeline.

Due to development sequence it's necessary to append a new rule type
to VALID_RULE_TYPES in Neutron first, and then move it to neutron-lib.
Because of this process, there's a risk that the new rule type is
present in both Neutron and in neutron-lib.

This is why check pipeline keeps failing with neutron-lib v2.14, as it
contains 'packet_rate_limit' and in Neutron we append it to the list
anyways, ending up with duplicates.

This patch ensures that there are no duplicates in VALID_RULE_TYPES.

In case of NFS Share backend (and maybe others) you can configure to
allow access only for specific uid at your backend. If root user tries
to access the share, it will fail.
But using the option nas_secure_file_operations to decide to use root or
not doesn't work, due to the nfs share can be owned by a other user
(e.g. libvirt changes volume owner to qemu:qemu)
So when nas_secure_file_operations is set to true we try first to
execute the command without root user, if it fails, we use root.

We need to check nas_secure_file_operations therefore also at
volume/manager.py but not all backends have this option, due to they
don't need this feature.
Therefore we use `try:` and pass, if the option is not defined.

The rdb unit test defines a shutdown field on the Mock class
unintentionally. This causes that a later test in the same
executor expecting that mock.Mock().shutdown is a newly auto
generated mock.Mock() but it founds that is an already used
(called) object. This causes that the later test fails when
asserting the number of calls on that mock.

The original intention of the rbd unit test was to catch the
instantiation of the Rados object in test so it set Rados = mock.Mock()
so when the code under test called Rados() it actually called Mock().
It worked but it has that huge side effect. Instead of this a proper
mocking of the constructor can be done in two steps:

rados_inst = mock.Mock()
Rados = mock.Mock(return_value=rados_inst)

This makes sure that every Rados() call will return rados_inst that is a
mock without causing Mock class level side effect.

The rdb unit test defines a shutdown field on the Mock class
unintentionally. This causes that a later test in the same
executor expecting that mock.Mock().shutdown is a newly auto
generated mock.Mock() but it founds that is an already used
(called) object. This causes that the later test fails when
asserting the number of calls on that mock.

The original intention of the rbd unit test was to catch the
instantiation of the Rados object in test so it set Rados = mock.Mock()
so when the code under test called Rados() it actually called Mock().
It worked but it has that huge side effect. Instead of this a proper
mocking of the constructor can be done in two steps:

rados_inst = mock.Mock()
Rados = mock.Mock(return_value=rados_inst)

This makes sure that every Rados() call will return rados_inst that is a
mock without causing Mock class level side effect.

Using rows.values() via the ovsdbapp API is inherently
racy as if there are multiple threads an add/delete can
interfere, triggering a RuntimeError (dictionary changed
size during iteration).

In one case we now directly use lookup() as we were
looking for a specific logical router.

In the other two cases we create a new class to do the
operation in a transaction, making it idempotent, since
both need to iterate the returned list.

Also changed the IDL notify code to use a frozen row to
similary avoid any possible race condition with there.

The upper constraints of the python dependencies were previously
set to the master as well as to the wallaby branch.

As there is a growing possibility of conflict between them,
it is preferrable to keep only one, branch accurate, version
of the constraints.

Furthermore the installation directive of the tox environment
is unnecessary, as the the dependencies can be specified
separately and pulled during environment setup.

The OVN BGP Agent allows to expose VMs/Containers through BGP on OVN
environments.

Initially, the agent will watch the OVN databases and react to events
such as VMs being created on provider network or VMs with attached FIPs
and advertises them via BGP.

In the future we would like to integrate the agent with other projects
such as the neutron-dynamic-routing [0] and re-use it's API.

The project is being proposed under x/ because it needs to mature prior
to requesting it to be included under the Neutron Stadium Projects
umbrella [1].

Currently, Nova relies on oslo_db managing connection to DB, sessions,
transaction handling, etc. Oslo_db uses SQLAlchemy as intermediate ORM
layer, which provides regular Session object to Nova context. But Nova
uses multi-thread architecture on top of uwsgi, which requires
thread-safe scoped_session. Modifying of oslo_db seems to be very
difficult because it strongly relies on current session mechanism. So,
this patch proposing lock usage which prevents multiple thread of the
same Nova node writing to DB simultaneously

Previously when an instance was removed the leadership settings and
charms.reactive flags remained for that instance's IP address. If a new
instance was subsequently added and happened to have the same IP address
the charm would never add the new instance to the cluster because it
believed the instance was already configured and clustered based on
leader settings.

Clear leader settings flags for instance cluster configured and
clustered.

Due to a bug in Juju the previous use of IP addresses with '.' were
unable to be unset. Transform dotted flags to use '-' instead.

The Masakari job uses 4 nodes and defaulted to a quite bulky
and not really supported config (MariaDB and RMQ on 4 nodes).
This change slims it down so that we test only HA of Masakari
and hacluster. The other services are deployed single-node.

Additionally, simplify the network group (it does not affect any
other job, the logic was simply overdone there).

The proposed approach allows for checking whether config
files are current, e.g. cases when the deployment was aborted after
config files were generated but before they were injected into the
containers which lead to old config staying in containers.

After this patch we can do:
  kolla-ansible genconfig
  kolla-ansible deploy-containers
and it would do what we expected rather than being a noop
in the second part.

We also lose the need to have notifies
and whens in config and handler sections respectively.
This is optimised in a separate patch.

Future work:
- optimise for large files
  - could we get away with comparing timestamps and sizes?
    container's should have a newer timestamp due to copy,
    could also preserve it

When using elasticsearch 7 with fluentd, you seem to get a lot
of warnings in the docker logs output that look like:

    [types removal] Specifying types in bulk requests is deprecated.

The docs suggest adding suppress_type_name to stop these warnings,
and that seems to work without affecting any functionality.

Sometimes, the registries may intermittently fail to deliver the
images. This is often seen in the CI, though it also happens with
production deployments, even those with internal registries and/or
registry mirrors - due to sheer load when trying to pull the
images from many hosts.

This patchs adds two new vars to control retry behaviour.
The default has been set to make users happier by default. :-)

That caused the kolla_role_name to leak everywhere.

and for the create share from snapshot workflow, we need to add a check
to distinguish both cases: when creating a share from snapshot, the
parent share availability zone is picked by default. Otherwise, if it's a
regular share create, the user can pick up the availability zone they need.

The tacker-horizon integration test framework has been implemented[1]
While adding integration test cases a selenium exception [2] was
observed for test cases under directory [3].

Tacker-horizon UI Details:

* Most of the Horizon plugins, such as manila-ui and vitrage-dashboard
  support integration tests, these plugins reside under ""Project"" tab.
* Whereas, tacker-horizon, mistral-dashboard are horizon plugins which
  have their dashboard anchored directly at the top-level alongside
  ""Project"" tab.
* The tacker-horizon has two-panel groups,
   * VNF Management
   * NFV Orchestration
* The ""VNF Management"" is a default panel and remains expanded in NFV
  dashboard, whereas ""NFV Orchestration"" is collapsed initially.

Selenium Exception Details:

* The horizon framework reports an exception
  ElementNotInteractableException, while opening pages under
  ""NFV Orchestration"" panel group.
* This error occurs when an element is not clicked or it is not visible
  yet.
* The menu item expansion code in the horizon integration framework
  expands only those menu items (level first, second or third) if only
  the previous menu item at the same level was expanded earlier.
* For example, in order to open a page[4] under NVF Orchestration panel
  group, the framework collapses ""Project"" tab and clicks ""NFV""
  dashboard.
  But it never expands ""NFV Orchestration"" panel as in second-level no
  such transition occured hence it remains collapsed. So test case fails
  to find desired page.
  On the other hand, test cases for pages under ""VNF Management"" succeed
  as the panel group by default remains open.

This patch adds functionality to detect collapsed menu items and expand
the items.

On change I2535017e112c8bcb9a2e516876f52a945e9c7da8 the cinder-manage
clean_locks command was introduced, but it has a bug where the OVO
`exists` method is incorrectly called, since it's missing a context.

This patch fixes this issue and properly calls the Snapshot and Volume
`exists` method.

parameters selected for export.

It is, effectivelly, a constant, but placed within a function
body, without declaration of it's exact contents in the docstrings.

By moving the 'export_data' among constants, we expose the information
about exported parameters, with minimal change to the original code,
as the 'tripleoclient.constants' is already imported by the module.

Commit creates three classes that organizes tests around sanity, cold
migration, and resizing vGPU instances; VGPUSanity, VGPUColdMigration,
and VGPUResizeInstance respectively. This allows more percise grouping
based around skip checks/requirements, e.g. VGPUColdMigration requires a
minimum placement version, compute node count, vGPU vendor id,  and vgpu
cold migration support in order to run. While sanity vGPU only requires
vendor id.

Commit also adds two new tests to the test class VGPUResizeInstance
which tests the following:
  * Resize vgpu guest to a flavor without vgpu property
  * Resize guest without vgpu property to a flavor that does

Lastly added a tempest flag for skip checking around tests that validate
cold migration and resize.

Remove the names property on kmip objects to ensure that it's possible to store mulitple objects of the same type in a kmip backend server. The KMIP spec specifies that a name should be unique and the pyKmip library inserts a default name attribute value when a name parameter is not provided. The name attribute ends up being the same value for every object of the same type leading to errors when trying to store them.

When a cloud is deployed earlier than the Train release, the placement
service is provided by nova-cloud-controller. As part of an upgrade to
Train, the new placement service is added and updates the placement
endpoint in the service catalog. The nova-cloud-controller charm no
longer advertises the placement service URL, but because the data
exists on the relation until removed, the service catalog changes the
placement URL to the placement endpoints advertised from
nova-cloud-controller.

Fix this by explicitly removing the placement service URLs when the
placement service is not provided by nova-cloud-controller.

Adds a step to unmount the tmpfs dir used by the HeatNativeLauncher
(heat-all aio process) when the process is stopped. Previously, the
mount was kept and would hang around until the next reboot.

As part of this change, the following is also included:

- The tmpfs mount dir is also changed to be at the generated temporary
  directory within the heat launcher dir (heat_dir), instead of one level
  higher up. This provides a location to backup the files before
  unmounting.
- The default value for the heat_dir directory is also changed from
  /var/log/heat_launcher to ~/tripleo-deploy/<stack>/heat_launcher, so
  that the artifacts are saved in the generated tarball.
- heat-all is started as the deployment user ($SUDO_USER, e.g. stack)
  instead of heat. There is no reason to run heat-all as heat. This
  enables keeping the generated files within the home directory of the
  deployment user
- The heat_dir directory, owned by root, has it's mode changed from 700
  to 755. This is safe as the directory is now in the deployment user
  home directory.  This is necessary so that the deployment user can
  read the directory.
- A step to backup the heat-all files is added such that the files are
  not lost when the unmount is done, and they are saved as part of the
  deployment artifacts.

This patch updates the way files related to iscsi are distributed
to the cinder, glance and nova containers that use the protocol.

Previously it was thought that only the iscsid container needs
access to /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf, but the LP bug reveals the client
side also reads the file in order to determine the list of chap
algorithms to offer when initiating an iscsi connection.

The bug was exposed when testing a secure environment that uses a
non-default list of chap algorithms. The iscsid container was using
the customized list, but the client containers (e.g. nova) were
using the default list, which caused iscsid to reject connections.

Most OpenStack API communication uses the cafile option in the
service_credentials config. For swift the client is created differently,
and does not get this option. When TLS is used, we may get an error like
the following:

retries exceeded with url: /swift/v1/AUTH_XXXX (Caused by
SSLError(SSLError(""bad handshake: Error([('SSL routines',

client that uses the configured CA file.

The new helper waits for the server to become ACTIVE again after the
reboot. This saves us a few lines of code in various tests, and is
also useful for the whitebox-tempest-plugin (see dependant patch).

We have a race where if a user issues a delete request while an
instance is in the middle of booting, we could fail to update the
'queued_for_delete' field on the instance mapping with:

  sqlalchemy.orm.exc.StaleDataError: UPDATE statement on table
  'instance_mappings' expected to update 1 row(s); 0 were matched.

This happens if we've retrieved the instance mapping record from the
database and then it gets deleted by nova-conductor before we attempt
to save() it.

This handles the situation by adding try-except around the update call
to catch StaleDataError and raise InstanceMappingNotFound instead,
which the caller does know how to handle.

ConsumerType has the same structure and behavior as a Trait

the name and/or the id. This makes it a good candidate to use
the AttributeCache, simplifying the code a fair amount.

In advance of a microversion 1.38, add the necessary database and
object code to support saving consumer types when creating consumers
and reporting those types when requesting usage information.

This patch adds a new table called ``consumer_types`` and also
add a new column called ``consumer_type_id`` that references the id
in the consumer_types table.

The consumer_type_id is nullable and records with a NULL
consumer_type_id are considered as 'unknown'.

In future changes we may wish to AttributeCache consumer types in
the same way that traits and resource classes are cached.

Usage object can now be retrieved by consumer type and include
consumer type information when retrieved. Until 1.38 that info
will not be used in results.

Allocations are written and retrieved with a consumer type but
the data is not yet presented in HTTP requests.

The original model used was to assert is_admin on the object context
which was actually used in only one place in ironic's code. Redudnantly
of course.

This is an excess call of is_admin on all API invocations, and is
simply not necessary as individual calls have API policy checking
and is_admin was only being consulted in the glance service utils...
However, the glance service utils also confirmed it should be able
to access glance if there was an auth_token present on the request
which should also always be the case. This was somewhat identified
as redundant/possible bug during the Wallaby cycle and appears to
be fine to remove

This does *not* remove the deprecated rule. At present, it appears
that rule may not be removed until after Xena.

Executing tasks has a performance penalty, even if they are skipped [1].
The prometheus role deploys a few types of services:

* core prometheus server and alert manager services
* centralised service-based exporters (mysql, memcached, OpenStack,
  etc.)
* distributed node-based exporters (node exporter, cadvisor) that are
  deployed to all hosts

There is a significant overhead in executing the tasks associated with
the core services and centralised exporters against all hosts, even
though they are skipped.

This change extracts the node exporter and cadvisor deployment into a
new prometheus-node-exporters role, to avoid executing the prometheus
role against all hosts. The new role is lightweight, and has a small
number of tasks, which should significantly improve performance.

apt-key is deprecated and in Debian 'bullseye' it complain when we use
it the way we did.

The right way is to store key files in separate directory and then, for
each repo source file, point to proper key. And this is what this patch
does.

Both distros use the same keys now.

The checkDNS script which is run inside the ceph-mon pods has had
a bug for a while now. If a value of ""up"" is passed in, it adds
brackets around it, but then doesn't check for the brackets when
checking for a value of ""up"". This causes a value of ""{up}"" to be
written into the ceph.conf for the mon_host line and that causes
the mon_host to not be able to respond to ceph/rbd commands. Its
normally not a problem if DNS is working, but if DNS stops working
this can happen.

This patch changes the comparison to look for ""{up}"" instead of
""up"" in three different files, which should fix the problem.

This transition the Ocata branch to End of Life. The last patch of the
branch will be tagged with ocata-eol tag. The ocata branch cannot be
used anymore and will be deleted if this patch merges.

This is needed as stable/ocata is not actively maintained in the recent
period and thus gate is broken due to job failures. By removing these
branches, infra resources will be freed up, too.

Please try to identify any zuul job, that is defined outside of the
repositories in this patch (for example in openstack-zuul-jobs, etc.)
and won't be used anymore if stable/ocata is deleted, and propose a job
removal patch for them.

Please +1 if the team is ready for us to proceed with this transition,
or -1 if there are still some activity on the branch and the team wants
to continue to maintain it.

The latest os-traits release introduced 3 new standard traits

While bumping the os-traits requirements it turned out that the
lower-constraints become extra slow causing a timeout. This result is a
catch-22 situation. The lower-constraint job cannot be fixed alone as
the global requirement bump already happened for os-traits 2.6.0
requiring fixing the placement tests. But fixing the placement tests
alone is not possible as the lower-constraints job will time out.

So this patch squashes in Icd0a304fc989c9535db125cd483ecac92deb011d:

Pip is slow to resolve version constraints with many unrestricted
dependencies. The recent slowness seems to be due to amqp is being
unrestricted and pip starts with amqp 5.0.3 but the real minimum is
somewhere around amqp 2.5.0. This patch adds amqp 2.5.0 to
lower-constraints to speed up the pip version resolution.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

The check_instance_host decorator when called with the check_is_up kwarg
is supposed to ensure that the compute service associated with a given
instance is fully up. Previously it used the HostStatus returned by
get_instance_host_status to determine this allowing either a state of UP
or MAINTENANCE.

However get_instance_host_status currently returns a HostStatus of
MAINTENANCE if the service is simply disabled regardless of the
underlying service being active or not. As a result of this and as set
out in bug #1938326 the check_instance_host decorator will pass allowing
calls to resize an instance to continue and later fail when RPC requests
to the instance host eventually fail.

To resolve this check_instance_host is now updated to only use the
service group API to determine if the underlying service is up.

Future work will look at updating the meaning of the MAINTENANCE
HostStatus to mean disabled but up. As this will potentially
change values returned in the API to admins doing an instance show this
will need to be done behind a new microversion to ensure backward
compatibility with the previous behaviour and meaning of the HostStatus.

We don't update instance.request_spec when we resize to a new flavor.
If the flavor's extra specs change, this is not reflected in
instance.request_spec.

This generally goes unnoticed when *adding* stuff to an instance. The
scheduler will still find a host based on the old request spec. The
resource claim on the destination uses the flavor and image data
directly (not the request spec) so the claim will correctly fail if
the destination does not have the new things that the instance wants.

When *removing* stuff form an instance this becomes problematic. The
scheduler will attempt to schedule based on the old request spec,
which could end up with NoValidHost if no host exists that has the
*old* stuff the instance wanted, despite the new flavor not wanting
any of that stuff.
