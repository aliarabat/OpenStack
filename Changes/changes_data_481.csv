Tacker is a MANO that it has a role to manage VNF life cycle.
Tacker now support several monitoring tools to check the status of VNF.
However, Simple monitoring tools also necessary to check the status of
application.
Currently, Tacker support basic monitoring drivers which could check
network(ping) and application(using HTTP URL).
Therefore, port monitoring driver helps to check the status application.
Moreover,it helps for auto healing of VNFC level.

  adding 'direct' and 'virtio-forwarder' plugging support.

* After this change, the vrouter VIF type will support the following three
  modes:
  * 'normal': the 'classic' tap-style VNIC plugged into the instance,
  * 'direct': a PCI Virtual Function is passed through to the instance,
  * 'virtio-forwarder': a PCI Virtual Function is proxied to the
    instance via a vhost-user virtio forwarder.

* The libvirt xml generation code was updated to support the modes.

* The Nova legacy VIF plugging code was updated to support the modes.

* The privsep wrapper for the vrouter port control binary was updated.

* The vrouter VIF unit test cases were refreshed and extended.

This constraint update was originally tried [1] awhile back and failed
because novaclient had removed some functionality that openstackclient
needed for providing floating ip and host commands. So we had to leave
the constraint at 9.1.1 pike for novaclient, but this prevented users
from being able to use the volume multi-attach feature out-of-the-box
in queens.

To improve the situation for users, the openstackclient stable branch
team allowed us to backport changes to stable/queens that would make
queens openstackclient work with novaclient 10.1.0 (queens). We have
requested a new release with those changes as a dependency here.

Once openstackclient 3.14.2 for queens is released, we would like to
update the constraint for novaclient queens to 10.1.0 to enable use
of the volume multi-attach feature out-of-the-box for queens.

 * The VIFGeneric os-vif type is used for the kernel TAP based
   plugging. If the os-vif plugin has not created a TAP device, the
   hypervisor will create one (multiqueue enabled, if set). If the
   os-vif plugin has to create a multiqueue TAP device, it needs a hint
   if multiqueue is desired.
 * This hint is passed by checking the port_profile of the os-vif object
   for the 'virtio_multiqueue' field before plugging. If it exists and
   is 'None', it is updated with the result from the multiqueue check.
 * Update the multiqueue check to take an instance.
 * Update the unit tests to correctly mock the instance object for
   multiple testcases.
 * Added unit tests for the multiqueue check.

An operators mailing list thread [1] discussing scale issues
where vif plugging times out eventually came to the conclusion
that several operators run rootwrap in the neutron agent in daemon
mode.

This ability is not clear from the configuration option help, however,
so this change adds more details on running in this mode to achieve
scale. Another nice discussion about this can be found here [2].

There is a corresponding nova patch [3] to mention this option
if operators are hitting vif plugging timeouts in nova.

This doesn't change any defaults, it just improves the documentation.

The help text formatting is also updated for easier readability
and maintainability in the source.

Ubuntu 18.04 has been released. We need upgrade to it this cycle.

Changes made in this patch

- Bump ubuntu repo from xenial to bionic. Some repos do not have bionic
  packages, so still using xenial repos.
- Drop mariadb, percona and nfs-ganesha repo, because these packages are
  already provided by Ubuntu official repo.
- Since qdrouterd does not have bionic repo and xenial packages does not
  work on Ubuntu bionic, just add it into ignore image list.
- Use python-rtslib-fb and targetcli-fb rather than python-rtslib
  and targetcli
- use xen-utils package name rather than with package version one.
- Seems unsigned repo won't work on Ubuntu bionic, stop using infra
  mirrored unsigned repo in gate building job.

There is no record for why we implement the database creation outside
of the role in the playbook, when we could do it inside the role.

Implementing it inside the role allows us to reduce the quantity of
group_vars duplicated from the role, and allows us to better document
the required variables in the role. The delegation can still be done
as it is done in the playbook too.

In this patch we implement a new variable called 'heat_db_setup_host'
which is used in the role to allow delegation of the database setup
task to any host, but defaults to the first member of the galera_all
host group. We also document the variable heat_galera_address which
has been used for a long time, but never documented.

This patch updates the Accept header logic that was broken

The sample generation code for policies has a couple different cases
that make sure deprecated rules have descriptions and reasoning
formatted in the comment section. One of the cases that handles
policies deprecated for removal was injecting an extra newline in the

the subsequent policy uncommented, and visually unpleasing.

This commit bumps the upper bound of Django to <2.1.
Django 2.x supports only python3, so this change only affects
Django version used in python3. Django versions used in python2
still continues to be Django 1.11 series.

Django minor version change usually contains backward-incompatible
changes and/or drops deprecated features, so the upper bound is not
dropped so that consumers can know which Django versions are supported.

upper-constraints.txt is not bumped now as django 2.0 support
in horizon plugins are on-going effort.

regression in the nova-lvm experimental job as n-cpu attempted to run
qemu-img info against block devices as an unprivileged user.

For the time being we should skip any attempt to use this command
against block devices until the disk_api layer can make privileged

The update_available_resource periodic task in the compute manager
eventually calls through to the resource tracker and virt driver
get_available_resource method, which gets the guests running on
the hypervisor, and builds up a set of information about the host.
This includes disk information for the active domains.

However, the periodic task can race with instances being deleted
concurrently and the hypervisor can report the domain but the driver
has already deleted the backing files as part of deleting the
instance, and this leads to failures when running ""qemu-img info""
on the disk path which is now gone.

When that happens, the entire periodic update fails.

This change simply tries to detect the specific failure from
'qemu-img info' and translate it into a DiskNotFound exception which
the driver can handle. In this case, if the associated instance is
undergoing a task state transition such as moving to another host or
being deleted, we log a message and continue. If the instance is in
steady state (task_state is not set), then we consider it a failure
and re-raise it up.

Note that we could add the deleted=False filter to the instance query
in _get_disk_over_committed_size_total but that doesn't help us in
this case because the hypervisor says the domain is still active
and the instance is not actually considered deleted in the DB yet.

The release process for official OpenStack components now uses
release requests using changes proposed to the openstack/releases
git repository. This allows peer review of release requests,
including version numbers, and run a series of checks to make
sure the release is likely to be successful once the tag is
pushed. The same process supports the creation of additional repo
branches as well. This all ensures that releases are reported
correctly on the releases.openstack.org website.

As a result of this process, nobody needs to push tags directly
or create branches directly. As an official OpenStack project
team, PowerVMStackers has switched to using that process already
for recent releases. However the ACLs were not fixed to remove
direct tagging/branching yet.

In case of HA routers IPv6 forwarding is not disabled by default and
then enabled only on master node.
Before this patch it was done in opposite way, so forwarding was
enabled by default and then disabled on backup nodes.
When forwarding was enabled/disabled for qg- port, MLDv2 packets are
sent and that might lead to temportary packets loss as packets to
FIP were sent to this backup node instead of master one.

If you deploy a stack with mixed-case hostnames things will break
because no task that is supposed to run on boostrap nodes will run
due to the following code:
HOSTNAME=$(/bin/hostname -s)
SERVICE_NODEID=$(/bin/hiera -c /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml
""${SERVICE_NAME}_short_bootstrap_node_name"")
if [[ ""$HOSTNAME"" == ""$SERVICE_NODEID"" ]]; then
...

The hiera key might contain mixed-case letters whereas the hostname
won't and the end result is going to be that no bootstrap tasks
will run on any nodes and, amongst other things, no database tables
will be created, making all services unusable.

Since we use bash explicitely we can leverage the ${var,,} expression
for this.

The unittests do some mocks of the keystoneauth Session contructor to
make sure Sessions are being constructed properly. In keystoneauth 3.7.0
we added two new options that can be used from oslo.config files, and
those options in turn now get passed to the Session constructor - which
breaks the mocks.

The thing is, neutron doesn't need to test that
load_session_from_conf_options works, keystoneauth tests that. What we
want to test here is that setting various config options has a specific
result. So instead of testing the entire args list (which could change)
test for the specific results we're concerned about.

... or at least the first published tarball which will lead to Rocky.
On the other side this means forcing the usage of mox as long as
there are tests that depends on it (the switch was already flipped
in Horizon, so it needs to be enabled here).

This allows us to depend on newer Horizon features, including changes
to the test suite that are useful for the mox removal effort.

The trusted vf attribute will be exposed to the instance through the

Note the logic when dealing with NetworkInterfaceMetadata devices was
refactored slightly in order to handle the existing cases where these

The PCI framework allows specifying some tags in the whitelist. The
operator who wants to enable 'trust' mode for certains pools of PCI
devices will have to add a ""trusted"" tag.

[pci]
passthrough_whitelist = {""devname"": ""eth0"",
                         ""trusted"": ""true"",
                         ""physical_network"": ""phys0""}

In Neutron the ports will have to be created with specific bindings to
match the tag so Nova will schedule the VM on a host which provides
such PCI devices (assuming that: PciPassthroughFilter is enabled).

PBM APIs break the API contract in vSphere 6.5 by raising
NotAuthenticated fault instead of SecurityError when session
is expired. We do catch NotAuthenticated faults (raised by
VIM APIs), but PBM APIs use the 'vim25' namespace which
result in not identifying the session expiry case. Therefore,

With the work done in [1], [2] and [3], we should be able to normalize
the description for segments by relying on that from the
standardattrdescription description.

This patch removes the 'description' from the segment extension's
attribute map as well as adds the standard attribute description and
shim extension in [1] as required extensions to ensure the description
is in fact added. Also the UTs are updated to inject the std attr
description into the segment API attributes for testing and no longer
test that description can be None (not supported with std attr
description).

Additional work is needed to close up the partial bug herein:
- Updating the segment API def/ref in neutron-lib.
- Consuming the former in neutron so that the segment extension uses
the API from neutron-lib.

There is no record for why we implement the database creation outside
of the role in the playbook, when we could do it inside the role.

Implementing it inside the role allows us to reduce the quantity of
group_vars duplicated from the role, and allows us to better document
the required variables in the role. The delegation can still be done
as it is done in the playbook too.

In this patch we remove the test-vars which were duplicated from the
role, and remove the DB setup tasks as they are no longer required.

We have never really tested python3 at large scale, and more and
more bugs are filed in stable branches due to dual stack.

We should stick to python2 in the stable branches, which is
what was tested in our gates.

- Python3 inventory testing isn't exercised anywhere and should
  therefore be removed, because of its setting false expectations.
- The bootstrap removed all references to python3, to ensure
  python2 is always used.

Some policies derived from standard policies are translated
by base policy translator. For example, a policy which has
`tosca.policies.tacker.Alarming` type derived from
`tosca.policies.Monitoring` type is translated by a translator to
`tosca.policies.Monitoring` type.

A policy which has a type derived from tosca.policies.Placement
doesn't seems to be translated by a translator to
`tosca.policies.Placement`.

This patch fixes this issue by adding the `tosca.policies.Placement`
specific check while translating nodetemplates.

This policy translation support is required to implement below

The quota driver config option was deprecated in Newton via
change 430638888c987a99e537e2ac956087a7310ecdc6. That was a
bit wrong in that the config option shouldn't have been
deprecated since we still use it, but we wanted to deprecate
the ability to load custom quota driver classes, which is done
in this change.

To be clear, this doesn't remove the option nor the ability
to configure the quota driver, it only removes the ability
to class-load out of tree quota drivers.

For containerized undercloud install this completes the image
preperation. The flow for undercloud install is now:

1. Early in tripleo deploy there is a dry-run prepare which generates
the heat environment for all of the image parameters
2. Here after the registry is installed, populate it by running
prepare again

This file is now a jinja template so that the prepare command has
access to the roles data. This reduces the number of images processed
to services which *might* be containerized, but we can't filter by
services which *are* containerised because we're inside the heat stack
and don't have access to the full heat environment. The actual image
numbers are:
136 prepare with no filtering
97 prepare filtering only by roles_data_undercloud.yaml
64 prepare with undercloud env+roles_data_undercloud.yaml filtering

This might be a time hit for undercloud jobs, but hopefully not

There is no record for why we implement the database creation outside
of the role in the playbook, when we could do it inside the role.

Implementing it inside the role allows us to reduce the quantity of
group_vars duplicated from the role, and allows us to better document
the required variables in the role. The delegation can still be done
as it is done in the playbook too.

In this patch we implement a new variable called 'gnocchi_db_setup_host'
which is used in the role to allow delegation of the database setup
task to any host, but defaults to the first member of the galera_all
host group. We also document the variable gnocchi_galera_address which
has been used for a long time, but never documented.

Default number of api workers in Neutron is set to be equal to
number of CPU cores on host. That is fine on production environment
but on fullstack tests, where each test spawns own neutron-server
process it might cause host overload.

This patch limits number of api_workers to 2 which should be enough
for single test case and should make significantly lower load on host.

In change Ice27c7080fc2df097cb387f7438c0aaf32b4c63d the placement api
was changed to set the accept header to application/json if the accept
header was not set. This was done to ensure that error responses are
formatted as JSON in the face of automation that webob does when
formatting errors.

That change was incomplete. Apparently many clients, notably requests,
which backs keystoneauth1, sets a default Accept header of '*/*'. This
is a reasonable default but means our error formatting default can go
awry.

This fixes it in the simplest way possible. See the referenced change
above for discussion on why doing this with a microversion would be
pointless.

Tested with a simple gabbi confirmation.

In some test jobs, like fullstack and ovsfw-scenario job
openvswitch kernel module is compiled from source before tests.
This compilation was failing because of new kernel 4.4.0-127 provided
by Ubuntu.

Kernel module will be compiled from source which contains
fix for this change in kernel.
See related openvswitch commit message for details:
https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/138df3e563de9da0e5a4155b3534a69621495742

As current Ubuntu uses ovs 2.9.0 we don't need to compile ovs for
ovsfw-scenario-job anymore because fix we needed is already contained
in ovs 2.9.0.

This adds a granular policy checking framework for
placement based on nova.policy but with a lot of
the legacy cruft removed, like the is_admin and
context_is_admin rules.

A new PlacementPolicyFixture is added along with
a new configuration option, [placement]/policy_file,
which is needed because the default policy file
that gets used in config is from [oslo_policy]/policy_file
which is being used as the nova policy file. As
far as I can tell, oslo.policy doesn't allow for
multiple policy files with different names unless
I'm misunderstanding how the policy_dirs option works.

With these changes, we can have something like:

  /etc/nova/policy.json - for nova policy rules
  /etc/nova/placement-policy.yaml - for placement rules

The docs are also updated to include the placement
policy sample along with a tox builder for the sample.

This starts by adding granular rules for CRUD operations
on the /resource_providers and /resource_providers/{uuid}
routes which use the same descriptions from the placement
API reference. Subsequent patches will add new granular
rules for the other routes.

According to [1], when a network contains more that one IPv4
subnet, they are returned in the 'classless-static-routes'
DHCP option, regardless of whether DHCP is enabled for them
or not.

However, the get_active_networks_info() method used for
synchronizing networks after the dhcp agent restarts filters
subnets with ""enable_dhcp=True"", which differs from the
get_network_info() method.  This will block VM access to
other VMs in the dhcp disabled subnets, even though they are
in the same network.  This is visible by looking at the ""opts""
file before and after a restart.

Change the dhcp agent to ask for all subnets in its
get_active_networks_info() RPC call by adding an
enable_dhcp_filter argument to toggle the behavior, with the
default being True to not break backwards compatibility.

It allows Virtual Functions to become “trusted” by the Physical
Function and perform some privileged operations, such as enabling VF
promiscuous mode and changing VF MAC address within the guest. The
inability to modify MAC addresses in the guest prevents the users from
being able to easily set up two VFs in a fail-over bond in a
guest. This spec aims to suggest a way for users to boot instances
with trusted VFs.

Some workloads run best when the hypervisor overhead processes
(emulator threads in libvirt/QEMU) can be placed on different physical
host CPUs than other guest CPU resources. This allows those workloads
to prevent latency spikes for guest vCPU threads.

To ensure emulator threads are placed on a different set of physical
CPUs than those running guest dedicated vCPUs, set the
``CONF.compute.cpu_shared_set`` configuration option to the set of host
CPUs that should be used for best-effort CPU resources. Then set a
flavor extra spec to ``hw:emulator_threads_policy=share`` to instruct
nova to place that workload's emulator threads on that set of host CPUs.

Rally does not adhere to the global requirements process, so its
requirements extend beyond those managed by upper-constraints, and
sometimes are incompatible with upper constraints.

We have no need to track their development from git commit to git
commit, and can rather rely on stable releases which we verify are
working with the upper constraints whenever we do a pinning bump.

This keeps things simpler for us, and also allows the repo build
process in the integrated build to do a constrained venv build
instead of doing it unconstrained and breaking stable branch builds
down the line.

This patch is the first step in syncing the nova host aggregate
information with the placement service. The scheduler report client gets
a couple new public methods -- aggregate_add_host() and
aggregate_remove_host(). Both of these methods do **NOT** impact the
provider tree cache that the scheduler reportclient keeps when
instantiated inside the compute resource tracker.

Instead, these two new reportclient methods look up a resource provider
by *name* (not UUID) since that is what is supplied by the

When running Ansible from a Mistral workflow, the default timeout
is now 30 seconds instead of the default provided by Ansible (12 seconds).
Under heavy load, it can take more than 12 seconds to reach nodes for the
first time. Increasing the timeout will reduce this risk when deploying
TripleO with limited resources.

The redis-server appears as ""masked"" in the OpenStack CI, even though it
did not in my test VM. As a consequence, ""systemctl enable redis-server""
fails, and consequently, the puppet run fails in OpenStack CI. The thing
is, there's no need to enable this service, as in all distros, it's
already enabled by default. Even in the OpenStack CI, the service appears
as enabled, but masked (which by the way, should never happen, as this
isn't a working systemd state).

This patch simply removes the enabling of the systemd service, so that
it also works in Debian in the CI.

Presently, rally in the integrated build is installed from PyPI, but without
constraints. This means the version installed may not be what is expected,
and the libraries that it pulls in are unconstrained and may cause failure

python3 only.

This commit removes the playbooks/defaults/repo_packages/openstack_testing.yml

venv getting installed from PyPI but with upper-constraints applied.

Commit 50c7edb9d8c5383303207026d30b4badc0c5f398 (""Only install
libvirt-python and python-lxml via pip"") added support for installing
libvirt-python and lxml on the virtualenv but this leads to problem like
the following one when executing all the virt_* modules.

The `libvirt` module is not importable. Check the requirements.

The problem is that libvirt-python and python-lxml are installed in the
virtualenv, but when Ansible operates on localhost, the default
interpreter is /usr/bin/python. As such, it's unable to find the
necessary requirements for all the virt_* Ansible modules. In order to
fix that, we need to pass the correct Ansible python interpreter when
operating on localhost.

Since we now pass the venv interp to Ansible, we also need to have
python-apt in the virtualenv in order to be able to use the 'apt'
module. However, in [1] it's clear that python-apt can't be installed in
a virtualenv so we have no other option than switching the ansible
python interpreter back to the host one for the tasks which need the
'apt' module.

This compilation was failing because of new kernel 4.4.0-127 provided
by Ubuntu.

When deploying a stack that containes mixed-case hostnames
the following error might be triggered:

Debug: Error: Error: unable to set attribute redis-role
Could not map name=TEST-STACK34-controller-1 to a UUID
while the name in the cluster is test-stack34-controller-1

This used to work pre-bundles because we used the facter provided
$::hostname variable which was lower-cased for us. With bundles we
switched to setting cluster properties from the service bootstrap nodes
and so we used the '<service>_short_node_names' hiera key which might
contain mixed-case hostnames.

In order to fix this we just downcase() the short_node_names hiera
string that we loop on so we can get the same behaviour we had on bare
metal.

Tested on an env with mixed-case hostnames:
[root@uppercaseovercloud-controller-0 keystone]# hiera -c /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml rabbitmq_short_node_names
[""UPPERCASEOverCloud-controller-0"",
 ""UPPERCASEOverCloud-controller-1"",

In some rare cases, an empty key file can get created within the fernet
key repository. When keystone tries to load the keys from disk, it will
fail with an invalid fernet key ValueError.

This change adds a check for empty files with a valid numerical name
within the key repository when rotating keys and loading keys. If an
empty file exists, it will be ignored when loading keys, reported in the

The test was originally implemented in this form as a tempest api test
case, but there is a problem with it being part of tempest suite,
because the suite should be safe to execute on a running cloud and
shouldn't affect other tenants. But sharing a network with everyone (*)
briefly impacts other tenants because they see a new shared network
popping up for a second in their net-list. It is also an issue because
if we are unlucky enough, some other tenant may start an instance
without specifying a particular port or network to use, in which case
there is a chance that nova allocates a port in this shared network and
attach it to the instance. When the rbac test case then tries to delete
the policy and the network, it fails because it's still in use.

The solution is to stop testing this scenario in tempest suite, instead
moving it into unit test suite.

A follow-up patch in neutron-tempest-plugin will clean up the bad test
case.

Default number of api workers in Neutron is set to be equal to
number of CPU cores on host. That is fine on production environment
but on fullstack tests, where each test spawns own neutron-server
process it might cause host overload.

This patch limits number of api_workers to 2 which should be enough
for single test case and should make significantly lower load on host.

This commit adds a note to the documentation to clarify which branches
tempest will support under the new extended maintenance stable branch
policy. The previous policy of supporting all active branches will not
scale under the new policy as we do not have enough resources to gate
all propsed changes against more than 3 stable branches at a time. With
the addition of this to the documentation we'll clearly define what
branches are in scope for testing of tempest and how/when we should
handle dropping support for a branch.

 - Introducing a config option - 'dns_servers' similar to 'dnsmasq_dns_servers'
   config option supported by dhcp agent and uses it as the 'dns_server' DHCPv4 option

 - If the 'dns_servers' option is not defined, then it uses the system dns resolvers

reduce the maintenance burden on the community when sweeping changes are
needed. The exterior role is built to be OSA compatible and may be pulled

Current devstack is missing the configuration of internal-client
that is used by Swift background processes. Though almost of the processes
doesn't require the configuration (hopefully it's better to be located, tho)
but the new background daemon called container sharder does.

Then, the missing configuration causes failure return code 1 at swift-init
that causes unfortunate gate failure if devstack is used to setup Swift
in the gerrit gate. (See related bug report in detail)

This patch attempts to setup the as-is internal-client configuration from
Swift's example configuration dir, that will work almost cases except user
customized devstack.

A recent change defaults the warning-as-error to True:

The object servers are correctly returning 200s for such objects, but
we were misinterpreting the result in the proxy. We had assumed that a
satisfiable byte-range contained at least one byte, which seems
reasonable unless you gaze long into RFC 7233.

Suffix byte ranges (e.g. ""bytes=-32123"") are not asking for the last N
bytes of an object; they are asking for *up to* the last N bytes, or
the whole thing if fewer than N bytes are available. In the EC
machinery, we had code that assumed ""has no bytes"" == ""unsatisfiable"",
which is not true in that specific case. Now we correctly handle a
suffix-byte-range request that is satisfiable but receives zero bytes.

This commit will fix authentication in boot from volume (BFV) feature,
which use the volumes from Cinder for Baremetal via Ironic.

Each volume will need pair of account for authentication when perform
sanhook into SAN device via iPXE. And sandboot from drive 0x80 (default)
also need pair accounts same with the iscsi sanhook on drive 0x80 with
multi volumes has supported.

NOTE:
- We could add more than two volumes into iSCSI Boot Firmware Table(iBFT)
- Due to Linux does not support an iBFT that has more than two volumes,
  thus BFV only support for add one etra volume. If over two volume in iBFT
  then machine will raise ""iBFT error: Control header is invalid!"".
- Our code-base already for more than two volumes in iBFT, If Linux kernel
  bugs[1] is fixing this issue then we can use BFV with more than two volumes.

Tested successfully on Fujitsu Baremetal Server TX2540 M1.

In the object server's PUT, POST, and DELETE handlers, we use the
request's X-Timestamp value for checking object expiration. In the GET
and HEAD handlers, we use it if present, but default to the current
time. That way, one can still use curl to make direct object GET or
HEAD requests as before.

If one object server's clock is ahead of the proxy server's clock for
some reason, and a client makes a POST request to update X-Delete-At,
then the skewed-time object server may refuse the new X-Delete-At
value.

In a cluster where two of the three replicas for an object live on the
same time-skewed node, this can result in confusing behavior for
clients. A client can make a POST request to update X-Delete-At,
receive a 400, and then discover later that the X-Delete-At value was
updated anyway, since one object server accepted the POST and
replication spread the new metadata around.

DELETE is somewhat less confusing. The client might get a spurious 404
in the above case, but the object will still be removed.

For PUT, an object server with a slow clock might refuse to overwrite
an object with an ""older"" one because it believes the on-disk object
is newer than the current time.

This patch implements the feature of baremetal inspect abort.

For a node in inspect wait state, an abort request initiates the process of
introspection abort.

Adds transision from ``inspect wait`` to ``inspect failed`` with event
``abort`` to the state machine.

Adds an ``abort`` interface to ``InspectInterface``, which raises
UnsupportedDriverExtension by default.

Implements the ``abort`` interface for ironic inspector inspect interface.

API microversion is bumped for backwards compatibility.

As part of getting away from using calls to the shell in the
tests, we will need code coverage of the commands library which
will no longer be used when the shell is no longer called. This
change is the first of serveral to provide unnit test coverage
for commands/host.

As a result of writing these tests, I needed to tweak a few things,
some to make mocking possible, and fix some minor issues:

- move delete confirmation prompt to its own method so it can
  be mocked.
- remove extra space from failed Host check message
- fix return code to 0 in Host setup, when the host is already setup.
- in shell, move inventory check to a method so it can be mocked.
