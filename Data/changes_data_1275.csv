The port and interface binding attributes in the Compute
cookbook are now redundant since there is the exact same
VNC endpoint information in the common attributes now.

This patch removes the redundant attributes from Compute and
updates the places they were used. This is a small change
to the default behavior of binding to the endpoint IPs
instead of the default bind_interface (was 'lo') but
makes the behavior consistent with other endpoint binding.

This reverts the deprecation warning added in commit
e80cf75fc0f25f6279200f59a70fd7c6e4766b0f.

V3 supports domain + project uniqueness, which is much more usable
than ids - massively more so for deployers. The initial patch
deprecates name, when that isn't necessary or appropriate - using name
based auth is as valid as id based auth - we just need to namespace
it in V3.

For V3 operators should be able to create:

* A service domain
* A service/service project
* A service/neutron user

to replace the prior

* service tenant
* neutron user

structure without switching to ids.

    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/75727/

The 'enabled' field wasn't always returned in a service response.

The 'enabled' attribute for services was stored in the 'extra'
column as part of a JSON string. Now the 'enabled' attribute is in
its own column. It will also be easier to filter out disabled
services now that enabled is a separate column.

With the 'enabled' field being a Boolean column in the database,
the server also needs to validate that the value is a Boolean (if
it's present). This is done in the same way that the server checks
the type of the 'enabled' value when creating users.

The nw_info value [] was being incorrectly equated with None. This caused
infinite recursion when api._get_instance_nw_info returned [] and was wrapped
with @refresh_cache (e.g., _get_instance_nw_info in
nova.network.neutronv2.api.API).

Fixes bug #1251792.

This patch adds a decorator for decorators that allows specifying the
arg names that the function being decorated must accept. If the function
being decorated does not accept the specified args, an exception will be
thrown during 'decoration', meaning import time usually.

If however the function accepts variable number of arguments, the
decorator will be a no-op as it is not possible to guess what will be
passed at runtime. This is however good enough for Nova's compute
manager decorators that inspired this work, as they decorate methods
with well defined and even versioned arguments.

Several decorators used in compute manager are now fortified with this
""compile time"" check.

SSH keys are equivalent to passwords for the ssh driver, and having to
special case deployment metadata to push them out of band to a file is
awkward. This patch adds the ability to pass the key in directly which
is much easier (in some environments).

On a system that has access only to a pypi-mirror without

This is due to the requisite *-dev packages not necessarily

This was causing issues with the wrap_instance_fault decorator, as it
expects the argument to be called 'instance'. Also it is being passed an
instance object now so instance_ref can be misleading.

This patch also moves all the tests for the said method to use instance
objects instead of a dict, as this is what is happening in reality.

Finally we secure the wrap_instance_fault decorator with a recently
introduced expects_func_args decorator so that we make sure this issue
does not go unnoticed in the future.

Doing volume force delete operation on volume-A will change volume-A's
status to 'deleted', so all related data about volume-A should be deleted.
Now current version's volume_destroy function doesn't delete related data
of volume transfer. If there is volume transfer about volume-A, first do
force delete operation on volume A, and thus the volume-A's transfer data
would be residual. So remove the related data of volume transfer in
volume_destroy function.

Adds a HEAT_DEFERRED_AUTH, defaulted to trusts, so users can
by default take advantage of the heat trusts functionality
which provides the following benefits:
- Deferred operations (e.g autoscaling) work with token-only auth
- The password field in the heat page of horizon can be made optional
  (horizon patch pending)
- It's more secure because heat no longers stores username/password
  credentials in the DB, only a trust ID.

The previous behavior can be obtained by setting HEAT_DEFERRED_AUTH
to something other than ""trusts"" - the value will only be set in
the heat.conf if the value of ""trusts"" is found, otherwise the
heat.conf default will be used (currently ""password"" which doesn't
use trusts)

To be able to run migration scripts on SQLite we've been providing
a few workarounds for sqlalchemy-migrate and SQLAlchemy 0.7.x and
0.8.x branches in the form of sqlalchemy utils module. In 0.9.x
releases a few workarounds become obsolete (due to improvements made
to schema reflection for SQLite in SA), but our test cases still
expect SA to raise exceptions in several cases.

As long as our utils can work well with 0.9.x SA releases with our
workarounds and without them, we can just skip the test cases
expecting exceptions to be raised when SA version > 0.9.0 is used
and continue to run them for older releases of SA.

Rescue interface is not supported by ironic.drivers.modules.pxe, but all
the drivers which use the PXEDeploy interface were incorrectly mapping
it to their rescue interface as well, leading to the appearance that
these drivers supported rescue functionality.

This patch corrects this by removing the incorrect driver interface
mapping, and deleting the unused stub class PXERescue.

A first step in refactoring/cleaning up the image API in Nova is
to get the image unit tests to be real unit tests, not functional
tests or using a fake Glance client. This patch merely moves three
static methods that were hanging from GlanceImageService and puts
these private functions at the module scope, where the rest of the
helper functions reside (these three for some reason were put as
static methods on the GlanceImageService instead of as private
functions in the module scope).

The next series of patches will modify the unit tests in
nova.tests.image.test_glance to pull out usage of the fake glance
service and use mocks to properly stress the edges of both the
v1 and v2 glanceclient client structures.

can see the API call time as part of normal tempest runs. This is
much more useful than this being done inside the servers, as this

this takes the rest client req/resp down to a single short info
line per call. This eliminates the issue where the multiline output
is interleaved between many testr process, thus confusing. It
should be a pretty concise view of the rest calls being made from
tempest.

It removes parameters that were previously used for debug. We'll
incrementally add these back if this was too much removal.

Puppetlabs-haproxy does not use ensure_resources
and can cause failures when combined with lbaas
agent class.

This patch makes package management of haproxy
optional so that agents::lbaas can play nicely
with that module without requiring a patch there
changing to ensure_resource.

The dependency is fairly safe since:
 - redhat package name is haproxy
 - debian package name is haproxy
 - puppetlabs-haproxy aliases the package name to haproxy

If the names of any of these things get out of sync, this
may lead to errors.

Since Messages objects can't be str()'d and native exceptions str()
their messages the patch also removes passing Messages to native
exceptions.

looks like something is running on the 9000 port on the gate and is
preventing this test to succeed. This test, as the others in this test

If an instance fails to boot due to a non-networking error the instance
then gets rescheduled and launched on another compute node. In these cases
deallocate_for_instance() is called which deletes the network ports
allocated though the info_cache for the instance is never cleared. This patch
adds a call to update_instance_cache_with_nw_info() which causes the cache
to get cleared out. Note: the cache is only cleared if the instance hasn't
been marked for deletion. This is due to how instance_info_cache_update()

New version is able to compare sequences whith elements that are not
hashable and cannot be compared (so that sorted() does not work).
For that, a utility function that caluclates difference between two
sequences was added. This function was also used in retry.ForEachBase.

The assertion was also renamed to assertItemsEqual, which matches
same assertion that was added in python 2.7.

The following resources are known to create a port on the ""default""
subnet even when no subnet is explicitly identified in the resource
creation:
- OS::Nova::Server (by specifying a network)
- OS::Neutron::Port (by not specifying a subnet)
- OS::Neutron::RouterGateway (deprecated, but still)
- OS::Neutron::Router (by specifying router_gateway_info)

This causes races during stack delete since the subnet cannot be deleted
if there are still ports associated with it.

This change retries the subnet delete, and treats response 409 Conflict
as criteria for a retry rather than an error.

This change also removes the implicit dependencies added to Port and
RouterGateway. It also means that Server and Router do not need the
implicit dependency workaround added to them.

This change also future-proofs any other neutron resources which create
ports on unspecified subnets.

Migration script 216 will wipe out all data in quota_usages table
when user_id is null. After the upgrade from Grizzly to Havana is
completed, the migration script 203 adds a new column user_id, so
user_id is null for all data in quota_usages. So the correct
behaviour should be sync quota_usages table first and then delete
data if user_id is still null.

Fixing the existing migrate script is because we can not find
the quota_usages data after migration script 216.

simply indicates the operation was unsucessful.  However, the attached

If DevStack is configured for the Cisco Nexus plugin, the following
error is observed:

Exception RuntimeError: 'maximum recursion depth exceeded' in <bound
method ConnectionContext.__del__ of
<neutron.openstack.common.rpc.amqp.ConnectionContext object at
0x403a3d0>> ignored

The root cause of the problem is that the Cisco Nexus plugin's
PluginV2.__gettattr__ method, a model object is being passed
as a value for a unicode %s format mod. Because the neutron server
has ""lazy gettext"" (deferred interpretation of unicode objects) enabled,
this causes many layers of recursive calls to deepcopy.

The fix is to pass a string object for the unicode %s mod field.

In XML specification, if a tag name contains a colon, a part before

dict contains a colon, Neutron XML serializer sends them as-is.
A colon in key names should be used only if XML namespace are used.
NEC plugin uses a colon in key names and it leads to failures to XML
deserialization. To avoid this problem, this commit removes a colon
and prefix n key names in port binding:profile so that client XML

Conductor service should de-register itself upon shutdown.
This will cause RPC requests to immediately stop routing to it
rather than there being an unnecessary period of malfunction
before the next heartbeat cycle.

A new unit test (test_stop_unregisters_conductor) is added to
validate the de-registration of the conductor. Test hostname
values are coalesced into a single variable for consistency.

This'll be nice to have in high-level exception handlers that really do want
to catch *everything*

For example, Swift has some error handling code that is intended to
prevent exceptions from ever getting back to the user.  Because we
don't know what exception classes a third-party lib might raise
(including ones that might not inherit from Exception), it is not
possible to enumerate all of the possible exceptions so a bare
except: is the only reasonable option.

on older hypervisors.
Added comparison of hypervisor version from the compute-node and image
metadata in the image properties filter.
In host scheduler image_prop_filter, the 'hypervisor_version_requires'
image properties, if available, is compared to the host_state's
hypervisor_version, if available.
hypervisor_version_requires should be added on the image as metadata and
should have a operator and version value.
Examples : "">=6.0"", "">6.0, <6.2"", """"!=6.1""

Partially Implements blueprint xen-support-for-hypervisor-versions
Cell scheduler changes coming up in another commit.

Full support for parallel testr workers now works in keystone. The
major item to be aware of is that if non-SQLite backends or a LIVE
LDAP backend is being used for testing, the concurrency must be set
to 1 to avoid conflicts. To artificially set the concurrency set
the env variable ``TEST_RUN_CONCURRENCY`` to the desired number of
testr workers. The default is to run one worker. To use 1 per
available core, set ``TEST_RUN_CONCURRENCY`` to 0.

Each worker uses a subdirectory of the test temp dir  based upon
the PID. When the worker exists (via the use of atexit), the
worker-specific PID directory is automatically removed.

The first time concurrent tests are run in a given environment,
ensure that old .testrepository directories are cleaned up as they
may introduce bad learning data on how to bin the tests based upon
test runs that occured without concurrency.

.tx/config is setup properly. .tx/config is the transifex configuration
file that is used for interaction with transifix.com for translation of

If you run the commands from the slave-script, it will update .tx/config
with information about the type of the files (PO-files). This change is
not needed and will break the periodic import script for horizon (which
does not exist).

Note that the slave-script needs a fix to work as well, will fix it in
the config repository. Also, the import script needs to be done.

Fixes bug 1291666

Previously, despite the clear intent of the code, the mongodb
driver failed to create indices on project_id for the meter
and resource collections, due to a index name clash.

Now, we ensure a different index name is used for the user_id
and project_id indices on each collection.

The previously missing index is created in the background to
avoid blocking other DB operations when upgrading against an
existing mongo instance with large collections.

Refreshing the network cache for an instance which is still building
is both unnecessary (the build itself will update the cache when it
completes) and can lead to a race condition if the periodic task gets
incomplete network information, then gets pre-empted by the build
thread, and then updates the cache after the build has finished.

Likewise there is no value in updating the network cache for an
instance which is in the process of being deleted.

cisco network plugin extends supported_extension_aliases in __init__
but supported_exntension_aliases is a class attribute and it is not
reset to the original even after each unit test finished.
To avoid this this patch copies supported_extension_aliases to
an instance attribute and extends it to ensure the class variable
is not changed. This reduces unnecessary logs in unit tests.
