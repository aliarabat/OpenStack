This reverts commit 750b562521b507aab555862f01b74e56f8119861.

Depending on the used procps version, the output of ""ps -e"" is width
limited and thus not matching the quite long process names. Using
""ps -ef"" fixes this, along with a small hack in the piped grep to filter
out grep itself (pgrep itself is not working for this).

Removes swift-*-replicator because it does not seem to be used
anymore in any of the container build configurations.

This change removes the renames from the previous commit because they
are backwards incompatible depending on how the containers are built. We
use healthcheck from the openstack-tripleo-common-containers-base which
is a package. If this package does not have the new file names (or old
filenames) and the containers are built with a different version of
tripleo-common, the container builds fail.  So let's skip renaming of
files so that we can deal with that as a separate issue as a whole.

We currently forcefully install pacemaker + pcs in a number of upgrade
tasks.  This is suboptimal because on certain nodes pcs/pacemaker repos
are not enabled.  Let's let puppet pull in those packages normally.

Tested this during a queen -> train FFU successfully on a composable
roles environment.

When the OVN Octavia Provider driver calls into
octavia-lib to update the status of a loadbalancer,
it might fail. This can happen if a resource associated
with the loadbalancer was not found, for example, if
it's DB transaction was in-flight.

A side-effect is the resource can become ""stuck"":

$ openstack loadbalancer listener delete $ID
Load Balancer $ID is immutable and cannot be updated.

The provider driver needs to retry the operation,
typically even the very next call succeeds.

Testing on our own deployment which has 'live_migration_tunnelled'
enabled has indicated that 'live_migration_inbound_addr' still
works in this case, despite the documentation suggesting otherwise.

Looking at the code I am lead to believe that
'live_migration_inbound_addr' is set on the migration target, and
is then used by the migration source to replace the '%s' in the
migration URI. Whilst the 'live_migration_uri' is ignored if both
'live_migration_tunnelled' is enabled and
'live_migration_inbound_addr' is set, the docs suggest further
impact on the inbound_addr which doesn't appear to be true.

This patch attempts to clarify the use of the live migration
parameters.

The policy engine converts simple strings into instances of rule
objects based on a policy DSL. This engine iterates checks and reduces
them after each iteration if performing the conversion on list of check
strings.

When we deprecate policies we apply a logical OR to make upgrades easier
for operators. The logical OR, implemented with an OrCheck, only needs
to be done once per deprecated rule. Today, we're re-initializing an
OrCheck instance each time we load rules, which happens every time
oslo_policy.policy.Enforcer.enforce() is called.

For most OpenStack usage, this isn't noticiable, especially if you're
only using it to enforce access to a specific endpoint. However, this
can get expensive if you're using the enforcer to protect the API,
protect each resource in a response, and protect each attrbute of the
resource (e.g., Neutron makes extensive usage of this pattern to
implement RBAC for resources it's responsible for).

This commit updates the RuleDefault object to track state of handling
deprecated logic ORs so that we only cast the check strings to OrCheck
instances once per rule no matter how many times we call load_rules().

During cluster deletion, magnum tries to delete the cluster's load
balancers in advance of deleting the heat stack. If these load balancers
do not exist for some reason, the cluster deletion will fail with an
error such as the following:

    Failed to pre-delete resources for cluster
    748b628a-2cd8-456f-8aee-c93804b2099b, error: list indices must be
    integers or slices, not str.

This happens because the heat stack has the physical_resource_id set to
None for the load balancer, which causes the load_balancer_show method
of octavia client to GET all load balancers, rather than just one. The
returned data is a list, rather than a dict, leading to the error above.

This change fixes the issue by checking if physical_resource_id is set
to None, and skipping the load balancer deletion if so.

This change refactors current implementation to determine key manager
backend for cinder and nova, based on the following two points.

- keymgr_api_class was deprecated a while ago. We can remove this
  parameter now.

- We don't have to redefine the parameter in puppet-tripleo layer but
  we can use the parameter implemented in puppet-nova or puppet-cinder
  directly.

When we moved the network deployment to free, we can hit a race
condition where some nodes are being configured prior to the controllers
being ready. This can lead to the basic network validation failing.  We
can deal with this by moving the validation to it's own play so that we
ensure all network configurations have occurred prior to to checking
that nodes can ping the controllers.

We want to switch the SOAP library backing oslo.vmware [1], which
changes how a ManagedObjectReference's attributes look like. To handle
the two representations in the tests - especially for the transition
period - we will set both attributes on fake.ManagedObjectReference.
Therefore, we have to use fake.ManagedObjectReference everywhere instead
of using manual Mock objects lacking one of the attributes.

This is being proposed as a convenience to help make sure stable
changes are being released. If the team is good with this going out,
please respond with a +1 to let the release team know it is OK to
proceed.

If it is not wanted at this time, or if there are more changes that
would be good to get merged before doing a  stable release, please
leave a -1 with a comment with what the team would prefer. We can
then either abandon this patch, or wait for an update with a new
commit hash to use instead.

Stein branch is in Extended Maintenance now[1]. All Tempest
plugins are branchless which means master version of Tempest
and its plugins is used to test the supported stable branches.

Once stable branch is moved to EM state then, Tempest and its
plugins compatible tag needs to be released so that we can
keep testing the EM stable branches with this tag once master
Tempest and its plugins are not compatible[2].

This tag will help for testing the stable/stein with single
compatible tag of Tempest and its plugins.

Tagging 'stein-last' as well as a new version also with same hash.

When extending volumes the Libvirt virt driver first calls os-brick to
refresh any host block devices so they show their new extended size
before calling down into Libvirt's virDomainBlockResize API to do the
same within the instance.

When extending encrypted LUKSv1 volumes the new size of the volume
provided to the virDomainBlockResize API did not previously take the
space already consumed by the LUKSv1 header into account. As a result
any attempt to extend a host block device based encrypted LUKSv1 volume
would fail as Libvirt would need to grow the device to allow room for
the LUKSv1 header.

This change corrects this by inspecting the host block device or remote
RBD volume using ``qemu-img info``. Since oslo.utils 4.1.0 the returned
QemuImgInfo object that encapsulates the output of this call now
includes LUKSv1 specific data such as the offset of the encrypted
payload, essentially where the users data actually starts within the
volume.

By subtracting this offset from the new overall size of the extended
volume we can ensure calls to virDomainBlockResize will now succeed as
no attempt will be made by Libvirt to grow the device.

Future work will also need to handle this extend_volume use case for
``dm-crypt`` based encryption providers ``plain`` and ``luks2``.

in RDO, it's used to find potential issues before they are found in

CentOS Stream is reported by facter as '8' with no minor version,

setting the version of libvirtd to 5.6 for all CdentOS 8 releases,

I0c3f14100a18107f7e416293f3d4fcc641ce5e55 introduced new logic when
extending LUKSv1 encrypted rbd volumes. As part of this qemu-img is used
to probe the rbd volume to determine the size of the LUKSv1 header.

The URI used to point to the rbd volume did not provide a user and
assumed that n-cpu/privsep would have access to the admin keyring. This
isn't always the case in most environments and would result in a failure
to probe the disk when the admin keyring wasn't available.

This change resolves this by appending the `id:$username` option to the
end of the URI provided to qemu-img using the `auth_username` found in
the connection_info from Cinder.

From Victoria onwards a conflict is seen between the rest-client
library used by the Monasca Fluentd output plugin and the openssl
library. Specifically, a more recent release of openssl has dropped
a default which is referenced by the 1.8 release of the rest-client
library. In this commit we bump the Fluentd output plugin release
to pull in a more recent version of the rest-client library which
can handle this change.

Add the ansible module `tripleo_unprovision_network`. Currently, We
don't have an automated way to clear the resources which
we create using ""openstack network provision"" command

be used to delete the composable networks.

This module will only delete a network and its sub resources if there
are no ports from corresponding subnets.

Also, Adds CLI playbook cli-overcloud-network-unprovision.yaml
Playbook loads configuration data file, iterates over each composable
network definition and calls the tripleo_unprovision_network to delete
the network.

save ci resources.

The patch adds a proper management result when displaying informations

When networks are created using REST APIs, if the MTU isn't specified
in the request, then a default value of 0 is used. Some use cases, such
as the auto-allocated-topology workflow, call the plugin directly to
create networks, bypassing the layer that inserts this default value.
Commit 68625686a40b3eb75502c8116f23d2297e288ca1 introduced a different
default value at the DB layer, defined by a constant in neutron-lib.
If the maximum MTU size has been configured lower than this constant,
then the user receives an exception, even though they didn't provide
a value for MTU.

This patch changes the default value used in the DB layer, so that
it's consistent with the workflow seen via REST APIs.

In the Victoria release, deployment images fail to build with the
following error:

/opt/kayobe/venvs/ipa-build-dib/lib/python3.6/site-packages/diskimage_builder/lib/common-functions: line 343: element-info: command not found

This is caused by the virtualenv bin directory not being included in
PATH while executing code from common-functions, which results in the
element-info script not being found.

This doesn't happen in Ussuri because older versions of DIB were
activating the virtualenv automatically [1].

This doesn't happen in master because its upper constraints allow a
newer DIB which doesn't use element-info anymore.

The fix is to activate the DIB virtualenv, which is done since
stackhpc.os-images v1.10.1 [2]. Bump in master first then backport to
stable/victoria.

When SolidFire is under heavy load or being upgraded, the
SolidFire cluster may automatically move connections from primary
to secondary nodes, in order to rebalance cluster workload.

Although this operation ocurrs very quickly, if an operation is made
to a volume at the same time it's being moved, there might be a
chance that API calls such as create snapshot could fail with
xNotPrimary error. Normally this will succeed on a retry of the
operation.

This patch fixes this issue by adding the xNotPrimary exception to
our list of retryable exceptions in the SolidFire driver.

This change ensures that active DPDK NICs are only added
to the list of mapped NICs once, and avoids duplicate entries.

When os-net-config runs for the first time there is no entry
in /sys/net for the DPDK NICs, so we look in
/var/lib/os-net-config/dpdk_mapping.yaml for the list of
DPDK NICs and add them to the NIC mapping list.

If os-net-config has been run before and the DPDK NICs are
already active, there is an entry in /sys/net and also an
entry in /var/lib/os-net-config/dpdk_mapping.yaml for the NIC.
This results in the same NIC being added to the list of active
NICs twice.

Both issues are fixed now and driver seems to be working fine on

services are filter based on role networks when adding

different than what is currently implemented for other

Compacts Kilo database migrations into a single migration,
'280_kilo.py'.

Users will now need to update to Kilo before updating to Liberty of
later.

This change is significantly more complicated than previous compactions,
mostly due to the changes to indexes specifically for PostgreSQL and
SQLite.

Specific changes include:

- Drop duplicate index covering 'host' and 'deleted' field of
  'instances' table (265)
- Drop duplicate index covering 'host' field of 'iscsi_targets' table
  (265)
- Add 'tags' table (266)
- Alter 'uuid' column of 'instances' table to be non-nullable (267)
- Add unique constraint to 'uuid' column of 'instances' table (267)
- Add 'host' column to 'compute_nodes' table (268)
- Add unique constraint to 'host' and 'hypervisor_hostname' columns of
  'compute_nodes' table (268)
- Add 'numa_node' column to 'pci_devices' table (269)
- Add 'flavor' column to 'instance_extra' table (270)
- Add a number of missing indexes to multiple tables on SQLite and
  PostgreSQL (271)
- Add a number of missing foreign keys and unique constraints to
  multiple tables on SQLite (273)
- Add index covering 'project_id' and 'deleted' columns of 'instances'
  table (274)
- Drop index covering 'project_id' column of 'instances' table (274)
- Add 'type' column to 'key_pairs' table (275)
- Add 'vcpu_model' column to 'instance_extra' table (276)
- Add index covering 'deleted', 'allocated', and 'updated_at' columns of
  'fixed_ips' table (277)
- Alter 'service_id' column of 'compute_nodes' table to be nullable
  (278)
- Drop foreign key constraint on 'service_id' column of 'compute_nodes'
  table (278)
- Drop unique constraint covering 'host' and 'hypervisor_hostname'
  columns of 'compute_nodes' table in favour of constraint covering
  'host', 'hypervisor_hostname' and 'deleted' columns (279)
- Alter 'name' column of 'key_pairs' table to be non-nullable (280)

Once again, we have a case where we've forgotten to apply a change to
the shadow table. We also have our first instance of table, the 'tags'
table, that does is not soft deletable and therefore does not have a
shadow table. Both are handled and the former can be resolved later.

Also note that we encounter a small bug in sqlalchemy-migrate along with
a possible bug in sqlalchemy itself. For the former, declaration of an
index before a foreign key that affects the same column will result in
it attempting to drop the index, even if it was never created. For the
latter, attempting to create a table that shares an enum does not work
on PostgreSQL. See comments inline for both issues.

Now that we can rely on the 'instances.uuid' column being unique and
non-nullable, we can remove the 'null_instance_uuid_scan' nova-manage
command. This will be done separately.

When testing, the previous base version was 253. It is now 279.

The healthcheck_curl has always been a bit bonky with the proxies

This leads to situation where an Operator puts some CIDR notation inside
this variable, while curl doesn't handle it.

This change adds a new python script. Since it uses python-requests, it
will have a proper support for the CIDR notation[1].

It will be called if and only if either NO_PROXY or no_proxy environment

One can also force the script usage by passing HEALTHCHECK_CURL_PY=1,
such as:

I8e349849db0b1a540d295c903f1470917b82fd97 bumped these versions late in
the Victoria cycle and it's time to do the same again during Wallaby.

The new MIN_{LIBVIRT,QEMU}_VERSIONs are:

MIN_LIBVIRT_VERSION = (6, 0, 0)
MIN_QEMU_VERSION = (4, 2, 0)

These versions are met by the three defined LTS distros supported by the
Wallaby release [1][2] of Ubuntu 20.04, CentOS 8 and openSUSE Leap 15.2.

The following constants are removed as part of this patch as since
I864494e11ff697788167c996a39f38d3d833d0d7 we now use these new minimum
versions in tests straight away, thus breaking many tests exercising
these now obsolete constants.

- MIN_LIBVIRT_VTPM
- MIN_LIBVIRT_S390X_CPU_COMPARE
- MIN_{LIBVIRT,QEMU}_BLOCKDEV

The removal of MIN_{LIBVIRT,QEMU}_BLOCKDEV means that the swap_volume
will always use the blockCopy libvirt method to copy contents between
disks. This in turn requires that fakelibvirt correctly model the
required flags and blockCopy method.

A future change will look into switching the remaining blockRebase calls
in the live snapshot flow to blockCopy.

Finally, NEXT_MIN_{LIBVIRT,QEMU}_VERSION are also updated to:

NEXT_MIN_LIBVIRT_VERSION = (7, 0, 0)
NEXT_MIN_QEMU_VERSION = (5, 2, 0)

The cross-cell resize code does not consider neutron ports with resource
request. To avoid migration failures this patch makes nova to fall back
to same cell resize if the instance has neutron ports with resource
request.

The re-factoring in https://review.opendev.org/766109
broke the undercloud installer in case the undercloud
hostname is'nt 'undercloud'.

Due to the re-factoring making use of setdefault to
append missing keys, not replacing them the Undercloud
installer role got two host entries. One host 'undercloud'
added by the _undercloud_inventory() method and then
another host entry matching the hostname of the
undercloud being installed.

Special case the role 'Undercloud', ensure this entry
is always overwritten to avoid the ""duplicate"" host in
the 'Undercloud' group.

Note: CI did'nt pick up the issue because all underclouds
      deployed by CI uses 'undercloud.$DOMAN' as the hostname.

When detaching a volume from an instance Nova will currently always
attempt to make a cast RPC call before returning a successful 202
response to the caller.

The lack of checking here regarding the underlying compute can lead to
requests never being acted upon and has often confused callers when the
compute itself is down.

This change aims to correct this by having the state of the compute
hosting the instance checked in the compute API layer. When the compute
is down the initial request is now rejected with a 409 conflict to the
caller so they understand why the volume still appears attached.

type in the sriov_config.yaml mapping file, so that
the nic numbering will be kept same.

Since we are using mistral to get the list of the plan
in TripleO, we require authentication for the clients
otherwise the validation Run won't work due to unable
to get mistral context.
This patch handle the authentication if provided by the user and
environment, if no authentifcation, since we cant generate dynamic
inventory, it checks if a static is passed with the CLI, if not it
raised an exception.

If authentication is provided and succeed, then tripleoclient can
safely call the plan_management to check and ensure if the plan is
present.

Conservative changes to get the l-c job passing with the new
pip resolver.

Big changes:
- pytz 2013.6 -> 2015.7 (u-c allows 2020.1)
  * needed for babel
- tempest 17.1.0 -> 24.0.0 (u-c allows 25.0.1)
  * for dulwich (long story)
- urllib3 1.21.1 -> 1.24.1 (u-c allows 1.25.10)
  * for tempest
- oslo.concurrency 3.25.0 -> 3.26.0 (u-c allows 4.3.1)
  * for tempest
- mccabe 0.2.1 -> 0.6.0
  * for flake8

Also added dulwich to test-requirements to narrow down versions
considered by the resolver.

Prior to this patch the IGMP configuration for ML2/OVN was inconsistent
with the configuration option description and also the ML2/OVS driver
because it was flooding traffic to unregistered VMs [0].

The ""igmp_snooping_enable"" configuration option says:

""Setting this option to True will also enable Open vSwitch
mcast-snooping-disable-flood-unregistered flag. This option will disable
flooding of unregistered multicast packets to all ports.""

But, in ML2/OVN that behavior was inconsistent prior to this patch
because it allowed traffic to flood to unregistered VMs. This patch
fixes it.

since [2] module_utils are also shipped in tripleo-ansible

This reverts commit b3ec034649e0d18de78fcfe5f903cfe9a0a18a6a.

Reason for revert: The patch was introduced as a workaround
to fix the leapp issue reproduced in v0.10.0 which throws
exception when the interface is not found. But with the
recent version of the leapp package, the issue is not
reproducible. The leapp upgrade completes succesfully
even with VFs present. Though the actual leapp commit which
fixed the issue not traced, the issue is no more present.
This workaround can be removed from TripleO, so that
nic paritioning FFU can be supported.

This revert is required for nic paritioning FFU, because
resetting the VFs will hang, when one of the VF is bound
to the vfio-pci (DPDK) driver.

We'll use the existing stack environment instead.
When we move to ephemeral heat stack, we'll use
a file. Rotate passwords would generate an environment
with passwords which can then be used in subsequent
deployments.

Also removes the legacy heat resource passwords as we
probably allow ffw upgrades from queens to

When import_role is used with a condition, the condition is
applied to all tasks in the role. This is inefficient. If we
use include_role instead, then the role inclusion task is

Now it seems to me that with tripleo_free strategy, the network validations
which end up pinging all controllers, are allowed to start any time and
there is no guarantee that the controllers are configured beforehand.

Let's make this more explicit. NB: I am not sure why I triggered it via

crude and does not disable scheduling on upgraded computes. This
results with few dead workloads that got scheduled on the compute
right before the upgrade.

We need to specify doc requirements in doc/requirements.txt
to avoid problems with the pip resolver [1] for the release team [2][3].
Removed specific doc requirements from test-requirements.txt.

The problem here is that this repos haven't doc/requirements.txt file
and by default in this case zuul will use the test-requirements.txt file
to pull requirements [4].

This requirements file contains extra requirements like flake8 that
collided with those allowed in our job environment and so the new pip
resolver fails to install these requirements and the job exits in error.

This project meet the conditions leading to the bug however it doesn't
produce any doc or releasenotes, but uniformization can't hurt and help
us in the future.

/!\/!\/!\
Notice that I voluntarily added the doc directory even if no docs
are generated here because zuul will try to pull this requirements from
there first and the contained requirements are needed for reno but AFAIK
the releasenotes dir is ignored by zuul. c.f [4] for further details.

Now ec2api uses volumev3 by default so we don't need to set

should be automatically created during share network creation,

This issue can be seen when 'security_service' config option
is set to use a 'kerberos' or 'ldap' security service.

On somewhat rare occasions the openstack service list call fails with
a connection aborted OSError 104 ECONNRESET. During an upgrade this failure
causes the script to think that the service it is checking for does not
exist and therefore it recreates the script. In turn this causes further
issues when other services try to use this duplicate service.
This is a temporary change in order to alliviate the issue while the root
cause is investigated.

stable/stein was first released in April 2019,
and the final release from this branch (8.1.4)
was made on 19 Nov 2020 [1]. This branch is
currently open only to take necessary third
party driver fixes and maintenance is at best
effort. A number of CI jobs have been broken
on this branch for a while. Let's clean them
up so we don't waste CI resources when backports
are proposed. This definitely implies loss
of test coverage, however, we have to weigh
the cost of repairing these CI jobs against
momentum of maintenance and work for the
future branches.

Jobs being dropped are:

* openstack-lower-constraints
pip's latest dependency resolver unearthed a bunch
of broken dependencies on this branch. Resolving these
would involve bumping the ""lower"" requirements, the
team does not think this will be useful for anyone,
since we will not be altering requirements for this
branch anymore.
* manila-tempest-dsvm-mysql-generic and
The reference generic driver had four jobs on this
branch, manila-tempest-dsvm-generic-no-share-servers.
We can cut it down to two by dropping coverage
for the DHSS=False configuration and multibackend,
both of which are tested in the other jobs, albeit
with other backends.
* manila-tempest-minimal-dsvm-lvm-centos-7
This is a lost cause, we don't expect to fix
devstack on centos-7 anytime soon for these
old extended maintenance branches (See bug#1888717)
* manila-rally-multibackend and
manila-rally-multibackend-no-ss - these rally
jobs have been broken for a while, there's
barely any reason to think we'll cause performance
regressions in the API on this branch and use
these jobs to judge them.

Also drop all the experimental jobs and remove
""openstack-tox-cover"" from the post queue.
We can also remove the openstack-tox-genconfig
job from the gate queue, since it exists on
the check queue, and need only run once.

Pin the version of tempest to a version
that supports python2.7, since we do not
fully support functional testing with
python3 on this branch.

NetApp driver is hard-coding the location of CA certificates for SSL
verification during HTTPS requests. This location may change depending
on the environment or/and backend.

This patch adds the `netapp_ssl_cert_path` configuration, enabling
each backend to choose the directory with certificates of trusted CA
or the CA bundle. If set to a directory, it must have been processed
using the c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. If not informed,
it will use the Mozilla's carefully curated collection of Root
Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates.

To limit usage of resources (mostly memory) in the fullstack job and
to avoid oom killer to kill e.g. mysqld service, this patch:

* Makes number of API workers changeable by tests, as a parameter to
  EnvironmentDescription and defaults its value to 1. As neutron server
  is spawned separately for each test and is used only to process just
  few API requests during that single test so this should be still
  enough there, and where more API workers are needed (like some dhcp HA
  tests: TestDhcpAgentHARaceCondition) it can be changed,
* reduces number of test run workers from 4 to 3 - job will run slower
  but hopefully more stable,
* in the functional and fullstack tests job definition disable etcd3
  service - this will not save us a lot of memory but still it's not
  needed at all so why to run it there.

This patch aims to fix clusters that uses only private network
and monitoring_enabled.

It was observed that:

- no floating ip, so the kube_master_external_ip is null
- because of that, the value that gets sent to the shell
for KUBE_MASTERS_PRIVATE is actually [null]
- this happens when deploying prometheus-operator
( label monitoring_enable=true )

Those topics above results in a cluster taking around 30
minutes to be completed until monitoring gives up configuring
endpoints.

Get rid of the TODO in the code and prepare for more management

during transition to manageable and on power state sync (essentially
same as before but for all drivers not only IPMI).

Update the IPMI implementation to no longer hide exceptions since
they're not handled on the upper level. Simplify the regex and fix
the docstring.

vendor-specific changes.

We've seen a few cases where the openstack service list is unable
to establish a connection with keystone thus causing the check to fail.
When this happens, an additional service is created unnecessarily.
When the addtional service is created, it tends to cause issues since
there are no endpoints asscociated with the new service.

Allow this check to retry several times.

The CONF.compute.max_disk_devices_to_attach option controls the maximum
number of disk devices allowed to attach to an instance. If it is set
to 0, it will literally allow no disk device for instances, preventing
them from being able to boot.

This adds a note to the config option help to call this out and changes
nova-compute to raise InvalidConfiguration during init_host if
[compute]max_disk_devices_to_attach has been set to 0. The nova-compute
service will fail to start if the option is set to 0.

Note: there doesn't appear to be any way to disallow particular values
in a oslo.config IntOpt other than the min/max values. Here we need the
min value to be -1 to represent unlimited. There is a 'choices' kwarg
available but that is only for enumerating valid values and we need to
allow any integer >= 1 as well.

Some hardware is very well intentioned. However this intention
can result in the UEFI NVRAM table being full which prevents us
from adding new records to the table. We can't be sure what to
delete, so in this case some operators just need the ability to
tell ironic ""it is okay if this fails, it will still work.""

The added ``ignore_bootloader_failure`` option adds
this capability which can be set per-node either in the agent
configuation via the ramdisk image, or in the pxe_append_params
configuration parameter for the node itself with a
``ipa-ignore-bootloader-failure`` option in order to prevent
the failure from being raised.

Ensure the TCP traffic leaving the OVN metadata namespace has
the checksum correctly populated. This is necessary when the
OVS datapath is ""netdev"".

Because the overhead added is minimal and only applies to the
metadata traffic inside the metadata namespace, this rule is
always set.

This patch also includes [1], that is a fix needed on top of
this one. [1] fixes who the code retrieves the datapath type,
executing the OVS IDL query to actually retrieve the data
needed.

When running minor update in a composable HA, different
roles could run ansible tasks concurrently. However,
there is currently a race when pacemaker nodes are
stopped in parallel [1,2], that could cause nodes to
incorrectly stop themselves once they reconnect to the
cluster.

To prevent concurrent shutdown, use a cluster-wide lock
to signals that one node is about to shutdown, and block
the others until the node disconnects from the cluster.

Tested the minor update in a composable HA environment:
  . when run with ""openstack update run"", every role
    is updated sequentially, and the shutdown lock
    doesn't interfere.
  . when running multiple ansible tasks in parallel
    ""openstack update run --limit role<X>"", pacemaker
    nodes are correctly stopped sequentially thanks
    to the shutdown lock.
  . when updating an existing overcloud, the new
    locking script used in the review is correctly
    injected on the overcloud, thanks to [3].

I7eb86edc130d186a66c04b229d46347ec5c0b625 introduced
VIR_ERR_DEVICE_MISSING into the hot unplug libvirt error code list
within detach_device_with_retry. While the change correctly referenced
that the error code was introduced in v4.1.0 it made no attempt to
handle versions prior to this. With MIN_LIBVIRT_VERSION currently pinned
to v4.0.0 we need to handle libvirt < v4.1.0 to avoid referencing the
non-existent error code within the libvirt module.

This significantly speeds up our doc build process. This requires a
newer version of 'sphinx-feature-classification' and some tweaks to our
own in-tree extensions. While we're here, we drop the '-d DOCTREE_DIR'
parameter since it's of no use when we blast away our previously built
docs each time we build.

When new port is created dhcp agent checks if IP addresses which are
assigned to that port aren't already associated with different ports
which are in agent's cache.
When it finds such duplicate IPs, resync of the network is scheduled.

The problem is that debug message which informs about such duplicate
IPs isn't very ""verbose"".
With this patch it will log new and cached port ids as well as ip
addresses on both of those ports. That should make easier to understand
why such duplicates are in the cache.

This patch also adds logging when methods like
_{network|subnet|port}_{create|update|delete} are called and with what
arguments exactly. This should help investigation what exactly happens
with some specific port in the dhcp agent.

During detach, and later during a failed attach, the port resource
allocation needs to be deleted from placement. Currently this is done
together with the unbinding of the port. This patch creates a separate
function for resource deallocation. This will be used later separately
when an qos interface attach fails after the resource allocation but
before the port is bound in neutron.

The SchedulerReportClient add_resources_to_instance_allocation and
remove_resources_from_instance_allocation are symmetric in nature. But
the remove_resources_from_instance_allocation took a differently
structured input than add_resources_to_instance_allocation. The
structure of the input of add_resources_to_instance_allocation is better
as it is the canonical form of the placement allocation request. This
patch therefore changes the input structure of
remove_resources_from_instance_allocation to match with
add_resources_to_instance_allocation.

it is failing. This patch fix it setting the rc file properly (stackrc

When werkzeug was used as the WSGI service for ironic-inspector, it
wrote stack traces to the logs whenever haproxy did a http check; this
listen_options line was the workaround for that. Reverting that change
is done for the following reasons:

- since ironic-inspector now uses oslo-service, the log stack traces
  are no longer written
- setting listen_options overrides the default 'option httplog', which is
  making diagnosing bug #1854399 harder
- this http-check override may well be the root cause of bug #1854399
  (any non-200 response will result in other connections to
  ironic-inspector being disconnected?)

ALPN is a TLS extension for application-layer protocol negotiation
within the TLS handshake [1].

This patch extends the Pool API to include a new 'alpn_protocols'
parameter. With this parameter, users can set an ALPN preference list
(descending order of preference) to be advertised by load balancer to
members.

This patch also adds HTTP/2 over TLS support to TLS-enabled pools to the
Amphora provider driver, although default the pool ALPN protocol list
configuration setting has HTTP/2 disabled similarly to the default
listener ALPN protocol list value added in Victoria release.

It appears that this library is typically run as the root user
which shouldn't require 'run_as_root'. When running as an
unprivileged user the required permissions can be granted by
specifying 'AmbientCapabilities = CAP_NET_ADMIN' in the service,
rather than 'CapabilityBoundingSet'.

An alternative approach would be to specify a 'root_helper' or to
switch to oslo.privsep, but these don't fully solve the problem
as the 'pyroute2' library also requires 'CAP_NET_ADMIN'.

and by default in this case zuul will use the test-requirements.txt file
to pull requirements [4].

This requirements file contains extra requirements like flake8 that
collided with those allowed in our job environment and so the new pip
resolver fails to install these requirements and the job exits in error.

This project meet the conditions leading to the bug.

Also these changes remove a stale `setenv`.

As of victoria, the default bind address for galera does not
include 127.0.0.1. As such these documentation examples do not
work.

Simply removing the explicit host command line switch appears to
work on our deployment.

Following the transition of RPM packaging project team into a SIG,
the team deliverables are now directly released by the SIG. The
Release Management team is no longer handling them using the
openstack/releases repository.

NB: we keep deliverable files for past series to reflect history.
Files for the cycle-independent deliverables are removed, to avoid
publishing erroneous release information (partial history ignoring
more recent releases from the SIG).

The existing policy tests exercised some common use cases that we've
identified (e.g., system-admin, system-member, system-reader,
project-admin, project-member, project-reader, etc).

This commit updates the tests to more accurately reflect personas we've
identified across the OpenStack community. This helps reduce mental
mapping of terms that differ between implementations.

This commit also updates the context objects to represent the role
implication feature in keystone. For example, users with the admin role
will automatically have the member and reader roles in their token,
which eventually make their way into the context.roles attribute.

This will help us test new policies that implement secure RBAC, which is
a broader change across the community to provide a consistent and more
authorization experience for deployers and end users.

When pushing with buildah, there is no logfile options.
It dumps results of work to stderr.
In debug mode, we want those results logged. But we do not
reconfigure oslo.log defaults, so it skips all details as
it goes with INFO config instead.

Capture debug results of process execution utility for buildah
push and use the current logging context as well.

Also oslo process utils will log the time it took to do
buildah bud builds as a nice free bonus.

variable min_microversion to to class SRIOVNumaAffinity to account for
this.

Also updated help msg for [whitebox-hardware]/physnet_numa_affinity to
be a more accurate description of the parameter.

Previously, ssync would not sync nor cleanup non-durable data
fragments on handoffs. When the reconstructor is syncing objects from
a handoff node (a 'revert' reconstructor job) it may be useful, and is
not harmful, to also send non-durable fragments if the receiver has
older or no fragment data.

Several changes are made to enable this. On the sending side:

  - For handoff (revert) jobs, the reconstructor instantiates
    SsyncSender with a new 'include_non_durable' option.
  - If configured with the include_non_durable option, the SsyncSender
    calls the diskfile yield_hashes function with options that allow
    non-durable fragments to be yielded.
  - The diskfile yield_hashes function is enhanced to include a
    'durable' flag in the data structure yielded for each object.
  - The SsyncSender includes the 'durable' flag in the metadata sent
    during the missing_check exchange with the receiver.
  - If the receiver requests the non-durable object, the SsyncSender
    includes a new 'X-Backend-No-Commit' header when sending the PUT
    subrequest for the object.
  - The SsyncSender includes the non-durable object in the collection
    of synced objects returned to the reconstructor so that the
    non-durable fragment is removed from the handoff node.

On the receiving side:

  - The object server includes a new 'X-Backend-Accept-No-Commit'
    header in its response to SSYNC requests. This indicates to the
    sender that the receiver has been upgraded to understand the
    'X-Backend-No-Commit' header.
  - The SsyncReceiver is enhanced to consider non-durable data when
    determining if the sender's data is wanted or not.
  - The object server PUT method is enhanced to check for and
    'X-Backend-No-Commit' header before committing a diskfile.

If a handoff sender has both a durable and newer non-durable fragment
for the same object and frag-index, only the newer non-durable
fragment will be synced and removed on the first reconstructor
pass. The durable fragment will be synced and removed on the next
reconstructor pass.

It has three labels:
'vulnerability_scanner_enabled', which triggers the
deployment of the DaemonSet (defaults to False).
'vulnerability_scanner_tag', which is the version of the container to be
used (defaults to the latest stable version).
'vulnerability_scanner_endpoint', which is the endpoint where a Clair
instance is running (mandatory if 'vulnerability_scanner_enabled' is
True).

The scanner runs on every node and analyses the pods running on the node
it was assigned to. Results of the analysis are delivered by marking the
pods with labels and annotations. The label 'security_level' can have
three values: unknown, safe and vulnerable. The annotations are
'unapproved_vulnerabilities_amount' and 'unapproved_vulnerabilities'
which are, respectively, the amount of vulnerabilities found on the pod
(counting all the containers together), and a JSON formatted string
containing a list with the IDs of the CVE and RHSA found per image.
