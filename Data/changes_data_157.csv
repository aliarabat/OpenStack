Without this patch, files in /srv/node are relabeled on every start of
the account_auditor and/or account_reaper containers. If there are many
files (eg. when using Gnocchi) this will take a long time, sometimes
dozens of minutes per container start, and might result in breaking
upgrades/updates.

Relabeling already happens in step 3, this should be sufficient and
prevent additional delays when (re-) starting containers.

Since pymemcache 3.4.0, localhost will first translate to ipv6 ([::1])
if possible instead of ipv4 (127.0.0.1). Since memcached is running in
the ipv4 interface, we need to point tooz to the right endpoint.

Currently, using Cinder's backup service with RBD the
backup-create operation gets stuck when logging
('use_json=True' must be set in the config file).

The oslo.log JSONFormatter gets stuck when passing an
RBDVolumeIOWrapper from os-brick. This happens via os-brick's
utils.trace() method which passes a connector containing
{'path': RBDVolumeIOWrapper}.
The oslo.log JSONFormatter format() method calls
oslo_serialization's jsonutils.to_primitive and passes in
this RBDVolumeIOWrapper object.
¬†
Therefore the to_primitive method eventually calls
RBDVolumeIOWrapper.read(). In order to fix this the current
path avoids mapping io.IOBase objects and fallback the wrapper
RBD volume object.

Kayobe currently supports definition of various different networks -
public, internal, tunnel, etc. These typically map to a VLAN or flat
network, with an IP subnet. When a cloud exceeds the size of a single
VLAN/subnet, this approach no longer works.

One way to resolve this is to have multiple subnets that map to a single
logical network, and provide routing between them. This is a similar
concept to neutron's routed networks, but for the control plane.

This change provides documentation for the currently tested parts of
this feature.

Currently, using Cinder's backup service with RBD the
backup-create operation gets stuck when logging
('use_json=True' must be set in the config file).

The oslo.log JSONFormatter gets stuck when passing an
RBDVolumeIOWrapper from os-brick. This happens via os-brick's
utils.trace() method which passes a connector containing
{'path': RBDVolumeIOWrapper}.
The oslo.log JSONFormatter format() method calls
oslo_serialization's jsonutils.to_primitive and passes in
this RBDVolumeIOWrapper object.
¬†
Therefore the to_primitive method eventually calls
RBDVolumeIOWrapper.read(). In order to fix this the current
path avoids mapping io.IOBase objects and fallback the wrapper
RBD volume object.

Rather than setting OpenStack CI settings if running on _any_ nodepool

This will also prevent the AIO bootstrap from false assertions that it is

The apt cache timeout has more general appeal to all CI systems, so the
cache_timeout setting is placed if ZUUL_URL is present, even if it is
not openstack.org specific.

The fixed period sign would potentially cause many hidden

And also, it is more important that we hope hostname won't be
changed during the leapfrog. Changed hostname would cause
nova-compute rebuilding nova.compute_nodes table since

that network creation will no longer stop after the first failed device,
since all are configured in parallel.

Param flush_on_reconnect is very risky to use on production

to memcached servers. Moreover this option makes sense only
in keystone's oslo.cache config.

This patch is moving flush_on_reconnect from code to oslo.cache

During cluster deletion, magnum tries to delete the cluster's load
balancers in advance of deleting the heat stack. If these load balancers
do not exist for some reason, the cluster deletion will fail with an
error such as the following:

    Failed to pre-delete resources for cluster
    748b628a-2cd8-456f-8aee-c93804b2099b, error: list indices must be
    integers or slices, not str.

This happens because the heat stack has the physical_resource_id set to
None for the load balancer, which causes the load_balancer_show method
of octavia client to GET all load balancers, rather than just one. The
returned data is a list, rather than a dict, leading to the error above.

This change fixes the issue by checking if physical_resource_id is set
to None, and skipping the load balancer deletion if so.

The problem here is that this repos haven't doc/requirements.txt file

This requirements file contains extra requirements like flake8 that

get_schema_helper() makes a direct short-lived connection to the
ovsb-server to grab the running schema before we initiate a
connection for the Idl. Moving the schema retrieving code out of
the path of starting the connection allows us to adjust to the
ovsdb-server's schema version at driver init instead of having to
set it in post_fork_initialize().

One benefit of this is that Events can be more easily defined to
watch for a table which might change depending on the schema, e.g.
Chassis vs Chassis_Private.

When setting the boot settings on Supermicro BMCs, the
BootSourceOverrideEnabled must be set to the desired
value whenever the BootSourceOverrideTarget is set or
it will revert to the default value (Once).  This is
different than what is currently implemented for other
BMCs in which the BootSourceOverrideEnabled is not set
if it matches the current setting.

This change uses the vendor setting to determine if it's
a Supermicro BMC.

This is required as instance snapshots taken in this environment are
fully allocated RAW snapshots and consume considerably more space than
sparsely allocated RAW snapshots taken when Nova is using a file based
imagebackend.

We could look into sparsifying the resulting snapshots from the lvm
imagebackend but for the time being given the available space in our CI

The ""Overcloud common bootstrap tasks for step 1"" setup pulls in the
tasks from the following file:
common_deploy_steps_tasks_step_1: {get_file: deploy-steps-tasks-step-1.yaml}

Now in that file we mainly do the following tasks:
- Set up the /var/lib/{tripleo-config,container-puppet,kolla} folders
- Write the container config json files
- Set up some puppet folders
- Write puppet step_config manifestes

Not only it makes sense to have these preparation steps before the
deployment steps, even at step1, but it also is strictly needed for
the Frr/Bgp service. The reason for that is that Frr runs containerized
and needs to start at deploy_step 1, so that traffic to the other bgp nodes
is working before step_config step 1 which contains the puppet
invocation to set up the cluster.

In particular the frr/bgp container needs to be started during
deployment step1 and to do so we need the kolla files and the other
container startup files to be set up before we invoke podman.

I could not figure out from the git history as to why this was not done
in the first place, it seems to not have been done on purpose.

So I did some extra testing to make sure nothing got broken by this:
1) Tested a composable control plane largish env with this patch only (train)
2) Tested a minor updated process on (1)
3) Tested a redeploy on (1)
4) Tested an FFU upgrade from queens to train with this change applied
   (3xctrl + 2xcmp)
5) Tested a BGP deployment spread over 3 racks in a spine/leaf
   configuration (~a dozen of deployments)

CentOS Stream is Rolling-release distro that tracks just ahead of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) development [1]. While not recommended
in RDO, it's used to find potential issues before they are found in
official CentOS 8.

CentOS Stream is reported by facter as '8' with no minor version,
breaking the logic to discover the libvirtd version. This patch is
setting the version of libvirtd to 5.6 for all CdentOS 8 releases,
including Stream, as 8.0 is no longer supported.

(cherry picked from commit b6294ce7a27379444ec9a447a51a6a1f83e9069f)

(squash) Do not test nova::migration::libvirt in 2 places

Currently behavior of the nova::migration::libvirt class is tested in
nova_migration_livirt_spec.rb, thus we don't need to test the same in
nova_compute_libvirt_spec.rb.

This patch also remove a redundant test case.

This oslo.policy Enforcer() object understands oslo.context
RequestContext objects and will translate the appropriate policy values
for you if it's passed into enforcement.

This lowers the bar for people interacting with oslo.policy because they
don't have to translate important authorization inforamtion from
RequestContext into a dictionary, specifically for policy enforcement.
Instead, they can just pass in the context object and oslo.policy will
know what to do.

This commit updates the policy module to do just that and moves the
credential tranlations to where it's needed, for logging.

As per the community goal of migrating the policy file
the format from JSON to YAML[1], we need to do two things:

1. Change the default value of '[oslo_policy] policy_file''
config option from 'policy.json' to 'policy.yaml' with
upgrade checks.

2. Deprecate the JSON formatted policy file on the project side
via warning in doc and releasenotes.

Also replace policy.json to policy.yaml ref from doc and tests.

upload-sign-csr action fails if the TTL is shorter than the default
value of default-ttl. Further change in the default-ttl value via
juju config command (to set proper default-ttl) results in the unit
to go to error state.
The flag certificates.reissue.global.requested which is set during the
upload-sign-csr action resulted in matching publish_global_client_cert
handler for any config changes. Since the invocation of handlers is
random in reactive framework, the unit goes to error state whenever the
publish_global_client_cert handler is invoked before the handler
tune_pki_backend_config_changed.

This patch blocks the execution of publish_global_client_cert handler
during any configuration change.

The original intent behind this appears to be so callers could use the
returned function only *if* the device remained attached after the
initial attempt to detach. However all callers to
detach_device_with_retry immediately call the returned function at
present so just call it when returning from detach_device_with_retry.

The ability to extend locally attached rbd volumes was initially missing
when the ``[workarounds]/rbd_block_device `` option landed via
Ied3732042738a6194b635c55e0304d71a6fb66e3. This support has however
recently landed in os-brick 4.0.0 via
I4bbf3778210d05c6934289116a85a8f344bed818. Nova simply needs to call the
extend_volume method of the rbd connector in order for it to fetch the
new size of the rbd block device.

As per the community goal of migrating the policy file
the format from JSON to YAML[1], we need to do two things:

1. Change the default value of '[oslo_policy] policy_file''
config option from 'policy.json' to 'policy.yaml' with
upgrade checks.

2. Deprecate the JSON formatted policy file on the project side
via warning in doc and releasenotes.

Also replace policy.json to policy.yaml ref from doc and tests.

The oslo.policy Enforcer() object knows what to do with instances of
oslo.context RequestContext() if you pass it one.

This makes it easier for people to perform policy enforcement since they
don't need to map important authorization information from the context
object into a dictionary (historically called `creds`). This practiced
didn't guarantee any consistency in `creds` implementations.

You also don't need to call context.to_policy_values() anymore. The
oslo.policy library will do that for you under the hood and map context
values into a set of policy attributes it understands.

This commit updates the calls to enforcement to pass in the context
object where applicable.

During cluster deletion, magnum tries to delete the cluster's load
balancers in advance of deleting the heat stack. If these load balancers
do not exist for some reason, the cluster deletion will fail with an
error such as the following:

    Failed to pre-delete resources for cluster
    748b628a-2cd8-456f-8aee-c93804b2099b, error: list indices must be
    integers or slices, not str.

This happens because the heat stack has the physical_resource_id set to
None for the load balancer, which causes the load_balancer_show method
of octavia client to GET all load balancers, rather than just one. The
returned data is a list, rather than a dict, leading to the error above.

This change fixes the issue by checking if physical_resource_id is set
to None, and skipping the load balancer deletion if so.

(manually squashed the subsequent fix [1] into a single commit)
(also manually squashed [2] because of #1906505)

There are certain HA clustered services (e.g. galera) that don't
have the ability natively to reload their TLS certificate without
being restarted. If too many replicas are restarted concurrently
this might result in full service disruption.

To ensure service availability, provide a means to ensure that
only one service replica is restarted at a time in the cluster.
This works by using pacemaker's CIB to implement a cluster-wide
restart lock for a service. The lock has a TTL so it's guaranteed
to be eventually released without requiring complex contingency
cleanup in case of failures.

Tested locally by running the following:
1. force recreate certificate on all nodes at once for galera
   (ipa-cert resubmit -i mysql), and verify that the resources
   restart one after the other

2. create a lock manually in pacemaker, recreate certificate for
   galera on all nodes, and verify that no resource is restarted
   before the manually created lock expires.

3. create a lock manually, let it expires, recreate a certificate,
   and verify that the resource is restarted appropriately and the
   lock gets cleaned up from pacemaker once the restart finished.

Prior to this change, the inspector created a separate connection
to the database, but since the schema migration's single transaction
hasn't finished yet (and therefore, hasn't committed it's changes),
this caused schema revision 392fb85b4419 to fail. Re-using the same
connection for inspection provides it with the same view
of the timeline, prior to committing those changes,
resulting in proper migration on PostgreSQL.

As a side effect, this might also enable applying these migrations
on other non-MySQL database engines.

missing from the tripleo_containers.yaml.j2 which causes issues at the time

stable/stein is in the extended maintenance phase and we will pin
tempest version to the latest tempest release (26.0.0) in Wallaby.
tempest 26.0.0 was released before merging tempest-horizon back,
so we need tempest-horizon too. This commit tries to install
tempest 26.0.0 and tempest-horizon 1.1.0 (latest release).
It makes the merge of tempest-horizon more smooth.

This reverts commit 750b562521b507aab555862f01b74e56f8119861.

Depending on the used procps version, the output of ""ps -e"" is width
limited and thus not matching the quite long process names. Using
""ps -ef"" fixes this, along with a small hack in the piped grep to filter
out grep itself (pgrep itself is not working for this).

Removes swift-*-replicator because it does not seem to be used
anymore in any of the container build configurations.

This change removes the renames from the previous commit because they
are backwards incompatible depending on how the containers are built. We
use healthcheck from the openstack-tripleo-common-containers-base which
is a package. If this package does not have the new file names (or old
filenames) and the containers are built with a different version of
tripleo-common, the container builds fail.  So let's skip renaming of
files so that we can deal with that as a separate issue as a whole.

When the OVN Octavia Provider driver calls into
octavia-lib to update the status of a loadbalancer,
it might fail. This can happen if a resource associated
with the loadbalancer was not found, for example, if
it's DB transaction was in-flight.

A side-effect is the resource can become ""stuck"":

$ openstack loadbalancer listener delete $ID
Load Balancer $ID is immutable and cannot be updated.

The provider driver needs to retry the operation,
typically even the very next call succeeds.

Testing on our own deployment which has 'live_migration_tunnelled'
enabled has indicated that 'live_migration_inbound_addr' still
works in this case, despite the documentation suggesting otherwise.

Looking at the code I am lead to believe that
'live_migration_inbound_addr' is set on the migration target, and
is then used by the migration source to replace the '%s' in the
migration URI. Whilst the 'live_migration_uri' is ignored if both
'live_migration_tunnelled' is enabled and
'live_migration_inbound_addr' is set, the docs suggest further
impact on the inbound_addr which doesn't appear to be true.

This patch attempts to clarify the use of the live migration
parameters.

The policy engine converts simple strings into instances of rule
objects based on a policy DSL. This engine iterates checks and reduces
them after each iteration if performing the conversion on list of check
strings.

When we deprecate policies we apply a logical OR to make upgrades easier
for operators. The logical OR, implemented with an OrCheck, only needs
to be done once per deprecated rule. Today, we're re-initializing an
OrCheck instance each time we load rules, which happens every time
oslo_policy.policy.Enforcer.enforce() is called.

For most OpenStack usage, this isn't noticiable, especially if you're
only using it to enforce access to a specific endpoint. However, this
can get expensive if you're using the enforcer to protect the API,
protect each resource in a response, and protect each attrbute of the
resource (e.g., Neutron makes extensive usage of this pattern to
implement RBAC for resources it's responsible for).

This commit updates the RuleDefault object to track state of handling
deprecated logic ORs so that we only cast the check strings to OrCheck
instances once per rule no matter how many times we call load_rules().

During cluster deletion, magnum tries to delete the cluster's load
balancers in advance of deleting the heat stack. If these load balancers
do not exist for some reason, the cluster deletion will fail with an
error such as the following:

    Failed to pre-delete resources for cluster
    748b628a-2cd8-456f-8aee-c93804b2099b, error: list indices must be
    integers or slices, not str.

This happens because the heat stack has the physical_resource_id set to
None for the load balancer, which causes the load_balancer_show method
of octavia client to GET all load balancers, rather than just one. The
returned data is a list, rather than a dict, leading to the error above.

This change fixes the issue by checking if physical_resource_id is set
to None, and skipping the load balancer deletion if so.

Access rules added to CephFS shares can fail
at the driver, or by the ceph volume client library.
Since the share manager can supply rule changes to
the driver in batches, the driver has to gracefully
handle individual rule failures.

Further some of the causes of the access rule
failures can be remedied by end users, therefore
asynchronous user messages would be a good vehicle
to register user faults that can be examined and
corrected.

cause infinite reconnects.

This patch passes the probe_interval argument to the ovs.db.Idl

Stein branch is in Extended Maintenance now[1]. All Tempest
plugins are branchless which means master version of Tempest
and its plugins is used to test the supported stable branches.

Once stable branch is moved to EM state then, Tempest and its
plugins compatible tag needs to be released so that we can
keep testing the EM stable branches with this tag once master
Tempest and its plugins are not compatible[2].

This tag will help for testing the stable/stein with single
compatible tag of Tempest and its plugins.

Tagging 'stein-last' as well as a new version also with same hash.

When extending volumes the Libvirt virt driver first calls os-brick to
refresh any host block devices so they show their new extended size
before calling down into Libvirt's virDomainBlockResize API to do the
same within the instance.

When extending encrypted LUKSv1 volumes the new size of the volume
provided to the virDomainBlockResize API did not previously take the
space already consumed by the LUKSv1 header into account. As a result
any attempt to extend a host block device based encrypted LUKSv1 volume
would fail as Libvirt would need to grow the device to allow room for
the LUKSv1 header.

This change corrects this by inspecting the host block device or remote
RBD volume using ``qemu-img info``. Since oslo.utils 4.1.0 the returned
QemuImgInfo object that encapsulates the output of this call now
includes LUKSv1 specific data such as the offset of the encrypted
payload, essentially where the users data actually starts within the
volume.

By subtracting this offset from the new overall size of the extended
volume we can ensure calls to virDomainBlockResize will now succeed as
no attempt will be made by Libvirt to grow the device.

Future work will also need to handle this extend_volume use case for
``dm-crypt`` based encryption providers ``plain`` and ``luks2``.

This adds a general mechanism for reserving property names that start
with os_glance. This has been done informally already, but no
enforcement was performed, except for specific keys on update. As a
result, banning these keys from create, for example, was missed and
users are able to set these keys during an POST /images operation.

CentOS Stream is Rolling-release distro that tracks just ahead of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) development [1]. While not recommended
in RDO, it's used to find potential issues before they are found in
official CentOS 8.

CentOS Stream is reported by facter as '8' with no minor version,
breaking the logic to discover the libvirtd version. This patch is
setting the version of libvirtd to 5.6 for all CdentOS 8 releases,
including Stream, as 8.0 is no longer supported.

In the volume.py module, the first parameter passed to the TaskMonitor
constructor was incorrect. The parameter passed was the resource object
(self), but it should have been the connector object (self._conn). This
affected the create_volume() and delete_volume() methods.

The constructor calls were updated to provide the correct connector
parameter. And the unit tests were updated to test that the TaskMonitor
objects are successfully created.

I0c3f14100a18107f7e416293f3d4fcc641ce5e55 introduced new logic when
extending LUKSv1 encrypted rbd volumes. As part of this qemu-img is used
to probe the rbd volume to determine the size of the LUKSv1 header.

The URI used to point to the rbd volume did not provide a user and
assumed that n-cpu/privsep would have access to the admin keyring. This
isn't always the case in most environments and would result in a failure
to probe the disk when the admin keyring wasn't available.

This change resolves this by appending the `id:$username` option to the
end of the URI provided to qemu-img using the `auth_username` found in
the connection_info from Cinder.

From Victoria onwards a conflict is seen between the rest-client
library used by the Monasca Fluentd output plugin and the openssl
library. Specifically, a more recent release of openssl has dropped
a default which is referenced by the 1.8 release of the rest-client
library. In this commit we bump the Fluentd output plugin release
to pull in a more recent version of the rest-client library which
can handle this change.

don't have an automated way to clear the resources which
we create using ""openstack network provision"" command

be used to delete the composable networks.

This module will only delete a network and its sub resources if there
are no ports from corresponding subnets.

Also, Adds CLI playbook cli-overcloud-network-unprovision.yaml
Playbook loads configuration data file, iterates over each composable
network definition and calls the tripleo_unprovision_network to delete
the network.

When networks are created using REST APIs, if the MTU isn't specified
in the request, then a default value of 0 is used. Some use cases, such
as the auto-allocated-topology workflow, call the plugin directly to
create networks, bypassing the layer that inserts this default value.
Commit 68625686a40b3eb75502c8116f23d2297e288ca1 introduced a different
default value at the DB layer, defined by a constant in neutron-lib.
If the maximum MTU size has been configured lower than this constant,
then the user receives an exception, even though they didn't provide
a value for MTU.

This patch changes the default value used in the DB layer, so that
it's consistent with the workflow seen via REST APIs.

following error:

/opt/kayobe/venvs/ipa-build-dib/lib/python3.6/site-packages/diskimage_builder/lib/common-functions: line 343: element-info: command not found

This is caused by the virtualenv bin directory not being included in
PATH while executing code from common-functions, which results in the
element-info script not being found.

This doesn't happen in Ussuri because older versions of DIB were
activating the virtualenv automatically [1].

This doesn't happen in master because its upper constraints allow a
newer DIB which doesn't use element-info anymore.

The fix is to activate the DIB virtualenv, which is done since
stackhpc.os-images v1.10.1 [2]. Bump in master first then backport to
stable/victoria.

When SolidFire is under heavy load or being upgraded, the
SolidFire cluster may automatically move connections from primary
to secondary nodes, in order to rebalance cluster workload.

Although this operation ocurrs very quickly, if an operation is made
to a volume at the same time it's being moved, there might be a
chance that API calls such as create snapshot could fail with
xNotPrimary error. Normally this will succeed on a retry of the
operation.

This patch fixes this issue by adding the xNotPrimary exception to
our list of retryable exceptions in the SolidFire driver.

Rename the file in the environments directory so that it
reflects its expanded scope. This file is used when
deploying storage with DCN sites regardless of if those
sites use HCI. We are now supporting non-HCI DCN sites
with storage so the old name is confusing.

Old name : dcn-hci.yaml
New name : dcn-storage.yaml

dcn-hci.yaml is depreacated but will remain in the environments
directory for backwards compatibility. dcn-hci.yaml will be
removed during the X cycle.

When setting the boot settings on Supermicro BMCs, the
BootSourceOverrideEnabled must be set to the desired
value whenever the BootSourceOverrideTarget is set or
it will revert to the default value (Once).  This is
different than what is currently implemented for other
BMCs in which the BootSourceOverrideEnabled is not set
if it matches the current setting.

This change uses the vendor setting to determine if it's
a Supermicro BMC.
