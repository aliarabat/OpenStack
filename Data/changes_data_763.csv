Implement upgrade testing for os_swift role.

This patch adds an upgrade testenv, which configures a previous version
of swift, and the test-vars from the previous stable branch to be used
by the previous version of swift.

We don't run functional tests after the initial stable/newton deploy
because a working stable/newton branch is already tested, and it's
assumed it worked if the upgrade works too - which is more efficient.

This follows the pattern setup for Keystone in:

- Updated tox envlist, so just running `tox` from the CLI will now run all
voting gate tests

- Reduce duplicated definitions and commands

- Remove any reliance on run_tests within tox

- Removes all doc references to run_tests.sh, and replaces them
with their tox equivalent. Where necessary, language around the tox
commands has been altered or extended so that it makes sense and is
consistent with other parts of the docs. Also adds a new ""Test Environment""
list to the docs, so that newcomers do not have to piece together CLI
commands and their cryptic extensions from tox.ini

- Move the inline shell scripting to its own file. Also fixes a bug when
passing args, since the logic assumed you were attempting a subset test
run (try `tox -e py27 -- --pdb` on master to compare)

- Moved translation tooling from run_tests to manage.py, w/ help text
and arg restrictions. This is much more flexible so that plugins can use
it without having to copy commands, but still defaults to exactly the
same parameters/behaviour from run_tests. Docs updated appropriately.

- Removed npm/karma strange reliance on either .venv or tox/py27. Now
it only uses tox/npm.

Our tempest test scheduled on osic-cloud1 all get stuck
in requirements installation.

The problem was diagnosed (fungi, tmorin) to be related
to the fact that the neutron devstack code for setting
up routers is installing via br-ex a route to SUBNETPOOL_PREFIX_V4,
which defaults to 10.0.0.0/16, which in the case of
osic-cloud1 contains the gateway IP to reach the Internet
(10.0.0.1):

fungi@ubuntu-xenial-osic-cloud1-s3500-5253075:~$ ip ro sh
default via 10.0.0.1 dev ens3 onlink
10.0.0.0/16 via 172.24.5.11 dev br-ex
10.0.0.0/8 dev ens3  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.5.131.187
172.24.5.0/24 dev br-ex  proto kernel  scope link  src 172.24.5.1

This change is a temporary fix for networking-bgpvpn that
sets SUBNETPOOL_PREFIX_V4 to a prefix *not* containing 10.0.0.1.

Proper version of this calculation is implemented upstream -
https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/151

And removed version of the code is actually harmful, as it's using
physicalprocessorcount (i.e. number of CPU sockets) for
calculations. So on a 2 CPU/48 thread system there it was 30 threads
instead of 768 calculated upstream.

I've decided that it's easier to completely remove this code instead
of duplicating current formula in upstream and providing a way to
override this value through hiera - just not worth a hassle.

This shows how we could wire in the upgrade steps using Ansible
as was previously proposed e.g in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/321416/

It's also very similar to the approach taken by SpinalStack where
ansible snippets per-service were combined then run in a series of
steps using Ansible tags.

necessarily the case (for instance, if you use pre-deployed services

::hostname fact will return something other than what we specified in
nova, and effectively breaks the configurations in we relly too much

By using hiera instead, we avoid this issue as we set those values to
be exactly what we expect (as we set them in the OS::TripleO::Server

This patch adds a local version of our template processing
routine so that developers can more quickly view the templates
that are actually getting generated. I've noticed multiple developers
now do a full deployment with 'overcloud deploy' only to download
the swift container with the generated templates. This simple task
avoids that step by allowing developers to generate it locally.

It also aims to preserve the ability to use t-h-t templates directly
with Heat (instead of going through Mistral) should users wish to do that.
The new undercloud heat installer requires the ability to generate
templates without requiring Mistral and Swift to do so.

Ideally the Mistral API workflow would use this same code
so perhaps in the future we might modify that routine to:

 -download swift tarball containing the templates
 -run this local routine that lives in t-h-t
 -re-upload the tarball of templates to the swift container

Block device handling can be somewhat complex - especially
when taking things like md, lvm or encryption into account.

This patch factors out the creation and deletion of the local
loop image device handling into a python library.

The main propose of this patch is to implement the needed
infrastructure.  Based on this, more advanced functions can be added.
Example: (advanced) partitioning, LVM, handling different boot
scenarios (BIOS, UEFI, ...), possibility of handling multiple images
(local loop image, iSCSI, physical hard disk, ...), handling of
different filesystems for different partitions / LVs.

This resets the indirection_api for the objects subsystem at the

test remotable stuff. At some point in a test run, this will get
set by one of those tests and remain set for other tests that
really don't expect to have to start a conductor.

Frankly, I'm kinda shocked that this hasn't caused failures before,
but I suspect we might've ""fixed"" spurious failures before by just
adding a start_service('conductor') statement.

This utilizes the new revision number to discard stale
port updates on the DHCP agent.

Backport Notes:

* The server does not provide the revision_number in Mitaka,
  but this patch still provides value to avoid accepting
  stale updates after a port was deleted since we track
  deleted ports separately from revision numbers.
* This also squashes in the cherry-pick for commit
  9019ff2f744ae91839d05a188358ef92343add43 so if a Mitaka
  DHCP agent is used with a Newton server, it will retrieve
  the correct 'revision_number' field instead of the initial
  'revision' field introduced by the first commit.

Providing the linuxinterface (qvoxxxx) as 'linuxif' to bagpipe-bgp
is not as harmless as it should be, because this is the key used
to determine when the last plug on an interface is done.

This patch provides the patch-port:vlan tuple instead, which should

This patch moves the t-i-e element code for hosts configuration
into a t-h-t shell script that gets driven by a os-collect-config
script hook.

This helps accomplish several goals:

 - moves us away from t-i-e

 - gives us better signal handling in the error case (where the
   previous element relied on 99-refresh-completed

 - Allows the t-h-t undercloud installer to more easily consume this
   since it doesn't rely on the old os-apply-config metadata (which
   that installer doesn't support).

setup_networks_on_host has not been implemented for
neutron networks and only implemented for nova net.

In order to address the L3 network issues related to the
live-migration in neutron, 'setup_networks_on_host' should
be implemented in the neutronv2/api.

This patch implements the function and updates the portbinding
profile dictionary with the 'migrating_to' key pointing to the
destination host in pre-live migration phase.

port:{'binding:profile':{'migrating_to': 'host'}}

When migrate_instance_finish() is called, it should clear
the migration profile before binding the host to the destination
port to prevent neutron from taking any action when the port-update
happens after the port migrates.

Based on the port profile update with the destination host,
the neutron will be able to create any associated L3 networks
on the destination host.

Further work is planned to issue a status update notification
to nova during the pre-live migration phase after the
L3 networks have been created on the destination host and
before the port lands on the destination host. This will
be addressed in a different patch, since we don't have such
wait state in nova at this time.

The neutron side changes are handled in different patch sets shown
below [1] server side and [2] agent side.

[1] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/275420/
[2] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/260738/

NOTE: Older versions of neutron may ignore the new port binding
migrating profile information.

When we launch an instance, nova updates the mtime for the _base image
to let the image cache manager know the image is actively used.  This
can lead to unexpected I/O errors when launching a large amount of
instances at once coming from the same _base image.

This commit puts the execute call in a try, except block to catch
possible errors. It also logs a warning with the path and error message.
With this, at least once the update will succeed.

List of improvements:
* Fixed bug with freezer complete command. The root cause of
  this problem was not implemented methods get_parser in
  classes SessionStart and SessionDelete.
* Actions session-start and session-end and appropriate classes
  was removed due to this actions are not called by user, it's
  triggered by freezer-scheduler directly [1].
* Action session-list now prints empty table if no sessions
  found.
* Import objects replaced on import modules

This patch optimizes how we deploy hiera by using a new
heat hook specifically designed to help compose hiera
within heat templates. As part of this change:

 - we update all the 'hiera' software configurations to set the group to hiera
   instead of os-apply-config.

 - The new format uses JSON instead of YAML. The hook actually writes
   out the hiera JSON directly so no conversion takes place. Arrays,
   Strings, Booleans all stay in their native formats. As such we can avoid
   having to do many of the awkward string and list conversions in t-h-t to
   support the previous YAML formatting.

 - The new hook prefers JSON over YAML so upgrading users will have the
   new files prefered. (we will post a cleanup routine for the old files
   soon but this isn't a new behavior, JSON is now simply prefered.)

 - A lot of services required edits to account for default settings that
   worked in YAML that no longer work correctly in the native JSON
   format. In almost all these cases I think the resulting codes looks
   cleaner and is more explicit with regards to what is getting
   configured in hiera on the actual nodes.

When syncing data from neutron server, metering-agent may receive
information about routers that are not hosted by the l3-agent on the
same host, because the server didn't filter them out. This could lead to
the following problems:
  * metering-agent tries to setup iptables rules for a router that is not
    on the host
  * metering-agent tries to get get traffic counters for a router that
    was once on the host but is already removed
  * metering-agent not sets up iptables rules for a router that is
    removed then added back to the host, because nothing about the
    router is changed from metering-agent's perspective

This commit fixes the aforementioned problems by making metering-agent
only receive information about routers that are on the same host, and
update metering-agent's knowledge about which routers it should care.

However, there could still be problem if one removes then adds a router
back to the same l3-agent, or just sets the router's admin_state_up
property to False then True in a short time(shorter than the interval
between two syncs). Because the metering-agent sees nothing changed
while during the same time the router's namespace is removed and added
back on the host. Thus metering-agent will fail to get such router's
traffic counters. This commit also make iptables-driver to forget such
routers and leave the metering-agent to reconfigure them later.

According to [1], security_groups_provider_updated will get port ids
to update the related security groups.

However, in the firewall of l2 agent, ports are identified by 'device'
attribute. This is fine for ovs agent, because, for ovs agent, port id
is the same as 'device' attribute.

But for other agent, like linuxbridge agent, the 'device' attribute of
port will be the device name. This will make l2 agent can't find port
and fail to update the security group of port. The info message at [2]
can be observed.

The fix is to convert port id list to 'device' list.

One of the step in creating iSCSI VLUN is to create a host on array.
If there are simultaneous requests comming on 3par array for creating
same host, hpe3parclient creates host for first request and returns
HTTP 409 conflict error for others, with error code 73, message ""host
WWN/iSCSI name already used by another host"". This was not handled by
3PAR iscsi driver and the HTTP exception would propagate up to volume
manager where it would log it. This patch addresses issue by catching
this exception and reusing the same host.

There's no reason to force the user to specify the name of a Zaqar queue.
In fact, doing so makes it difficult for users to create multiple instance
of the same template without having all of the messages go into a single
queue (and without deleting the shared queue when one of the stacks is
deleted).

We now autogenerate a sensible randomised name if none is provided.

Add -S option to support subgraph execution. This would allow a user
to pick which tasks to stop on.

Example:

fuel2 graph execute -S keystone-db:openstack-controller/1

will start with all keystone-db tasks and end at openstack-controller at
node-1

Previously, we had multiple packages, like storlet_middleware,
storlet_gateway and so on, in our storlets repository.
This patch integrates these packages into one package, to follow
general manner of python packaging.

Also, this patch replaces previous install system using ant by
new install system using python setup.py.

NOTE1:
Currently we have an independent installation tool for c/java, as the
other existing OpenStack projects (ex. Monasca) do. To install c/java
modules, run './install_libs.sh' at the top directory. It installs
required files under /usr/local/lib/storlets, so you may need root
privilege.

NOTE2:
We install agent resources also on host, but this is currently kept
to be used for our future plan to let containers use agent resources
by mounting it from host node.

NOTE3:
This patch also removes outdated ansible playbooks.

Villalovos,jlvillal,"Disable devstack plugin for builder 'ironic-grenade'

Disable the devstack plugin for items which use the 'ironic-grenade'
builder as the grenade plugin in Ironic already enables the devstack
plugin. If the devstack plugin is enabled twice it gets run twice
which will have it attempting to create the bare-metal VMs twice and
failing.

Create a new builder: 'ironic-vars-early' as the ordering is
important.  Previously we had a bug because ordering was changed and
the ironic plugin was enabled after the ironic-inspector plugin. Work
around this issue by using this new ironic-vars-early builder.

This is needed because some projects switched to only support WSGI

--config-dir parameters when starting the service.

Note: This patch will automatically land in master with the next
oslo.config release. That's why this is not a cherry-pick from master.

to network:router_interface. This means that certain actions (such as
trying to use 'neutron router-interface-delete' and migrating the router
to DVR) won't work (since a router interface of the appropriate type
can't be found and an SNAT port won't be created, respectively). This
patch takes care of the needed migration.

In senlin the relationship between nodes may have dependencies.
For example some container nodes are running on vm nodes, some nodes
are used as the DB nodes. These information are stored in the
'dependents' property of nodes which has the format like
{'nodes': ['node1', 'node2']}, at the same time the container nodes
which are running on the vm cluster, also have dependencies on vm
cluster. The profile id of container nodes are stored in cluster's
'dependents' property like {'profiles': ['profile1', 'profile']}.

Prior to Ib563b0ea the passphrase used by CryptsetupEncryptor and
LuksEncryptor had any leading zeros per hexadecimal digit removed, for
example 0x04 or 04 would turn into 0x4 or 4. As a result any volume
encrypted prior to the release of Newton used a modified passphrase that
was different to that stored by the key manager being used in the
environment.

To correct this for LuksEncryptor volumes permission denied errors are
now caught when attempting to open a volume. A second attempt to open
the volume is then made using a mangled passphrase. If successful the
correct passphrase is then added to the volume before the mangled
passphrase is finally removed. This workaround can be removed in a
future release once it is safe to assume that all LuksEncryptor volumes
have had any mangled passphrases replaced in this way.

This isn't possible for CryptsetupEncryptor volumes as the plain mode
used by cryptsetup does not provide a way for adding and removing keys.
As such on a permission denied error a second attempt is made to open
the volume using a mangled passphrase. Unlike the above workaround this
cannot be removed in a future release.

Instead of using the default security group - creating and
using a new security group in setup_network_and_server.
This should help when two tests are in the same class and have the
same tenant which can cause problems when one test is changing the
security group, adding rules etc.

Also adding resource cleanup in API tests base for security groups.

Neutron has adopted neutron-lib plugin directory and the codes
to load plugins have been moved to neutron-lib, which fails our
test cases because directory.get_plugin in neutron-lib doesn't
load our FakePlugin.

2. What is the solution to the problem
Mock directory.get_plugin in neutron-lib to return FakePlugin
in our test cases.

The main goal of this change is to add support for Xenial to
trove/integration and ensure the voting check jobs continue
to pass when switched to Xenial.

- It was decided that Trusty should continue to be supported
to aid in the developer transition to Xenial. Therefore,
the elements have been organized to accomplish this by making
""trusty"" and ""xenial"" specific elements extend the already
existing ""ubuntu"" elements.
- We tried to do the initial work without impacting the core
Trove code therefore some choices were made - for example,
cluster delete doesn't work for PXC on Xenial (see [1]) so
the test that does this is skipped for PXC.
- Only Mysql, PXC, Postgresql and Redis were fixed for
Xenial and tested as these are the only voting jobs
currently. Future work should sort out the elements for the
rest of the datastores. Note that all of the datastores should
continue to function on Trusty.
- Previously, the ""DISTRO"" variable was hardcoded to ""ubuntu"".
This is no longer the case; DISTRO and RELEASE variables will
be automatically set to whatever the base OS is (for example,
if you are running trovestack on Xenial, DISTRO will be set
to ""ubuntu"" and RELEASE will be set to ""xenial"". These can
be overriden if needed.

Monasca notification will be running in a controller. There
are two way to add proxy, either via system proxy or via application
settings. The problem with system settings is that we need to add
no_proxy for all the other connections which is more difficult if there
are more number of outgoing connection which doesn't require proxy. Since
hipchat/slack most probably need proxy settings, it is easy to add
proxy settings only for hipchat/slack rather than changing the system-wide
environmental settings. Operators can also use system wide setting instead
of application specific settings by not using the proxy confifg option. This
gives a choice for the operator dependening on the complexity of the
installation.

In the case that the ceph storage backing volumes is different
from the one backing ephemeral storage in nova, the auth values
in the rbd connection_info could be different and not work if
we are using the nova.conf values for ephemeral storage.

This change makes the volume connection config code for rbd
prefer the cinder connection_info values if they exist, and
only falls back to nova config values if cinder doesn't have
anything set.

The backing disk currently created is 8GB. devstack-gate
sets that to 24GB when running Tempest. We're seeing ceph
job failures due to NoValidHost in the cinder scheduler
because 8GB isn't enough capacity for Tempest runs. So this
change uses the same backing disk size for the ceph jobs as
we get in the default devstack setup, which uses LVM.

There are two issues with setting this value in devstack-gate:

1. It's already hard-coded and set to the same value in the
   devstack-plugin-ceph repo which we are now using in all
   ceph jobs after I44c3a0c35e8dbcc49c0ac1800e9075cc3a169fdd.

2. The 8GB value is not large enough compared to non-ceph jobs
   which use VOLUME_BACKING_FILE_SIZE=24GB. That is being fixed
   in devstack-plugin-ceph to use VOLUME_BACKING_FILE_SIZE to
   set CEPH_LOOPBACK_DISK_SIZE in change
   I788eefa6c1d427bf51d2d3d40be4abe0336443e7.

We can remove this now before the devstack-plugin-ceph change is
merged because the plugin is already hard-coding the same value.

The LibvirtNetVolumeDriver is handling both rbd and
sheepdog (iscsi) connections. The auth config logic
is mingling both backends which is really confusing.

For example, the iscsi protocol only defines auth_method,
auth_username and auth_password. It does not set an
auth_enabled value in the connection_info['data'] dict.

This change simplifies the logic involved for setting
the auth config by decoupling the rbd/iscsi handlers.

A follow-up change will build on this to fix the
rbd auth config to prefer the cinder volume connection_info
auth data over the local config for nova in the case
that different cinder backends are used for ephemeral
and block storage.

The RST image directive takes an alt paramter that's used to supply
an alt attribute for the HTML image element that's generated during
RST -> HTML conversion.  The alt text is useful for accessibility
purposes and is also displayed if the image source is unavailable
when the HTML is generated.  Because of the latter point, we can't
rely on the accessibility features of the SVG image, we need to
maintain some info here in the README.rst file.

and run_validation=True in Tempest, so it does ssh testing in the
Tempest API tests. It also actually tests the file injection code
in Nova.

This is needed for testing the 2.32 microversion in Nova, so add it
to Nova's experimental queue. Also add it to the experimental queue
for Neutron since it's a Neutron job.

This is non-voting and experimental since it has a pretty high
failure rate due to bug 1598581. Tempest runs with it in the
check queue though, so it would be good to get this voting in the
near future.

XenAPI requires two instances of L2Agent: the standard one manages OVS
bridges in DomU and the service name is called as q-agt in Devstack;
the other new L2Agent manages OVS bridges in Dom0 and the service name
is called as q-domuA. In order to support the new agent q-domuA, it
requires some XenAPI-specific configurations. But unfortunately those
XenAPI-specific configurations were configured in the standard agent
file, meaning other changes made to the standard agent file would not
have the correct effect. So it has caused issues, for example, floating
IP addresses are not reachable.
This fix is to move the XenAPI-specific configurations from the stardard
agent configuration file to the XenAPI-specific agent configuration file
so that it won't impact the standard agent's behavior.

Adding a TaskManager aware wrapper around Adapter gets us a natural
interface for migrating one call at a time away from python-*client and
to direct REST calls. The Adapter shares the Session with the clients,
but it returns munches and throws exceptions that match the exceptions
we're expecting outside of shade.

Also, move compute_client calls out of their own tasks

Putting compute_client calls in a Task will cause them to be doubly
enqueued. This has to be combined with this patch because otherwise the
double-invocation fails functional tests.

Currently, the code does an initial detach from the persistent and
transient domains in one call, then follows up with a call of the
retryable function, which first checks the domain xml before retrying
the transient domain detach. If the transient domain detach (which is
asynchronous) completes after we checked the domain xml, trying to
detach it again will raise a LibvirtError exception. Then, our loop
code in `_do_wait_and_retry_detach` doesn't catch it and will respond
with error. We should be handling the `disk not found error` from
libvirt and consider the job complete.
