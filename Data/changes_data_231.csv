These are the final release taggings for all cycle-with-rc projects.
While not required, having PTLs ack this patch would be nice to include
that record in the merged metadata.

Release activity should now be frozen until this is processed on May 13.
Any bugfixes merged to stable/ussuri can be queued up and ready to go as
a follow on stable release after the coordinated release date.

Since it always comes up - yes, the diff-start is right. That's the
calculated starting point where the last stable branch was created.

The current vif-related functions in ovs_lib do two separate
queries: get_port_name_list() and a db_list(). There is a chance
that the contents of the database could change during this time.

This patch adds an external_id 'neutron-bridge' when creating
ports, so that a single atomic db_find query can be made.

TODO:
  update the OVS agent to automatically add the neutron-bridge
  external_id to existing ports where it is missing in case
  there is an upgrade without running neutron-ovs-cleanup

  delete the pretty much useless test_ovs_lib unit tests which I
  know this will break--we already have functional tests covering
  the same thigns.

As should be obvious by the above TODO, this is a WIP. I wanted to
get some feedback before spending too much time on this.

The job was only triggered by merges ('post' pipeline), which means
that new tags are not replicated until the next merge.

also trigger that job when a tag is pushed ('pre-release' and

of tripleo_deploy and reuses the prompt_user_for_confirmation code in
the tripleo upgrade and undercloud upgrade actions.

Without this patch, when an OAuth1 request token is authorized with a
limited set of roles, the roles for the access token are ignored when
the user uses it to request a keystone token. This means that user of an
access token can use it to escallate their role assignments beyond what
was authorized by the creator. This patch fixes the issue by ensuring
the token model accounts for an OAuth1-scoped token and correctly
populating the roles for it.

Modified to work with older test helper function:

This includes a few fixes that will need to merge together in order to
pass.

Stop testing grenade

Grenade testing has a dependency on a newer stestr than what was
available in pike. Rather than rewrite the grenade job, since this
branch is in Extended Maintenance anyway, just drop the job.

Remove requirements-integration job

This job was a legacy job that attempted to verify each project could be
independently installed after all global-requirements had been
installed.

This job is no longer necessary since we have much better coverage with
requirements-check and other jobs that make sure the requirements are
compatible. It is also a legacy zuulv2 job, uses the long deprecated
devstack-gate, and runs with Python 2.7.

For historical reference, this was added originally to PBR back in 2013
[0] and moved to requirements in 2014 [1].

With ansible 2.9 IHA breaks like this:

TASK [If instance HA is enabled on the node activate the evacuation completed check] ***
Tuesday 05 May 2020 08:36:49 +0000 (0:00:00.403) 0:15:33.184 ***********
fatal: [compute-0]: FAILED! => {""msg"": ""The conditional check 'iha_nodes.stdout|lower | search('\""'+ansible_hostname|lower+'\""')'
failed. The error was: template error while templating string: no filter named 'search'. String: {% if iha_nodes.stdout|lower |
search('\""'+ansible_hostname|lower+'\""') %} True {% else %} False {% endif %}\n\nThe error appears to be in
'/var/lib/mistral/overcloud/ComputeInstanceHA/host_prep_tasks.yaml': line 391, column 5, but may\nbe elsewhere in the file depending
on the exact syntax problem.\n\nThe offending line appears to be:\n\n register: iha_nodes\n - file:
path=/var/lib/nova/instanceha/enabled state=touch\n ^ here\n""}

This is because in ansible 2.9 changed the way filters work.
We need to use the 'is' keyword just like we do in a number of other
places in tripleo-ansible.

Fixing vbmc_setup.yaml for c8 scenario012-standalone job with this
patch.

vbmc_setup.yaml was originally written for c7 multinode[0] to install
virtual BMC and a libvirt domain on the controller for ironic to
manage. In scenario012 we are trying to test something close to ironic
in overcloud(Blueprint[1]).

In the past, We have moved scenario012 mutinode to standalone job and
reused vbmc_setup.yaml.

The shell script in vbmc_setup.yaml need following modification as its
now a C8 standalone job:-

* Added 'set -e' so that script exits immediately if a command exits
with a non-zero status so it would result in deployment failure.
Currently deployment is passing even if some commands in the bash
script are failing. Addition of 'set -e' will correct this behavior.
* Replaced yum with dnf as yum not present in Centos8.
* No need to override resolv.conf entry as standalone job already
configure necessary nameserver entries.
* No need to install additional repos as as standalone job already
configure necessary repos.
* When vbmc_setup.yaml was introduced intention was to do non-kvm
emulation[2] and that was the reason qemu-system-x86 and qemu-kvm-ev
was pulled from epel, but for c8 these packages are no longer available
in repos [3] including epel. We can use qemu-kvm package instead and
we will no longer need epel repos.
* create-node.sh command option to use qemu-system have to be removed
as qemu-system-x86 package is missing and we are using qemu-kvm
instead.
* Temporary workaround[4] to upgrade ansible in the neutron container
can be removed as ansible version in container is now v2.5.8+.
Test patch for tripleo-ci-centos-8-scenario012-standalone is here[5].

The existing documentation is full of useful bits for setting up TLS
everywhere and TLS for public-only endpoints. This commit adds an
introduction that attempts to describe the usecases for using TLS.
Additionally, it adds short, concise descriptions of the components
needed in TLS deployments and why they're important.

This is going to be the first of a series of documentation patches
that attempt to refactor the existing TLS/SSL documentation to be more
use-case driven. The goal is to make it easier for readers and TripleO
developers to understand how TLS works in TripleO.

Ubuntu Focal doesn't have python-pip, only python3-pip. Trying to
uninstall a package that apt doesn't know about (installed or
uninstalled) results in a nonzero exit code so devstack fails. This
patch makes the package removal safer for both python2 and python3 cases
by checking first if the package exists.

pip doesn't have a dependency resolver. Instead, it ""simply uses the
first specification it finds for a project."" [1] In Train, keystone
switched from hacking 0.12.x/0.13.x to hacking 1.1.x [2]. That change
explicitly added a pycodestyle dependency for reasons that aren't
entirely clear to me, but pip's broken dependency resolution leads to
the below funkiness when trying to install the dependencies.

  ERROR: flake8 2.6.2 has requirement pycodestyle<2.1,>=2.0, but you'll have pycodestyle 2.5.0 which is incompatible.

As seen below, this can be easily reproduced and seems to happen because
pip doesn't go further than one level of dependencies, meaning it knows
about the dependency on flake8<2.7.0,>=2.6.0 from hacking, but not the
dependency on pycodestyle<2.1,>=2.0 that this in-turn introduces.

The solution is simple: stop explicitly requiring this dependency and
instead rely on flake8 bringing it in.

The 2.10 transition has a routing.yml file that points each
individual module from ansible/ansible to a new location. That means
we can put:

    os_server:
      redirect: openstack.cloud.server

into lib/ansible/config/routing.yml in ansible/ansible and have
the result be the end user's playbooks still working with the
old names while providing new names that are less ugly.

This adds a routing file to our collection repo, as well as the
script used to generate the new mapping.

When boot is managed by the ironic side, a node is powered on
right after starting introspection. Inspector's own delays play
no role and may actually prevent introspectin from happening if
a node boots faster than it's whitelisted in the PXE filter.

Currently, we use only a single primary shard for each beat index,
as configured by the index templates. This is not usually an optimal
setup, as all index searching is handled on a single node. A more
efficient configuration for a small number of different indices is
to balance, with around one primary shard per node. This
commit exposes the config option to set the number of primary shards,
which was previously hardcoded to 1. This now defaults to one shard
per data node in the cluster.

It was used to smoothen out the difference in handling bytes in
Python 2 and 3. Now that we only support Python 3, it can be
replaced.

A side effect of this change is that we no longer accept bytes
in JSON. JSON does not support bytes, but this problem has been
hidden due to oslo.serialization until now. The configdrive
handling has been updated to account for that.

This new synthetic field is linked to a ""QosPolicyFloatingIPBinding""

Now is possible to provide this field in the create/update input

The OVO takes this parameter from the DB object. When the DB object
is retrieved, the QoS policy binding register is retrieved too due
to a backref link in the ""QosFIPPolicyBinding"" DB model to the

When boot is managed by the ironic side, a node is powered on
right after starting introspection. Inspector's own delays play
no role and may actually prevent introspectin from happening if
a node boots faster than it's whitelisted in the PXE filter.

This changes moves the delay handling later in the process and
only does it when manage_boot is True.

we can just get ceilometer library directory with python command.

This variable is not set correctly at the moment if role is ran with

This adds a tool script that loops through all of our requirements and
output basic information for each one along with any things we might be
concerned about with each one. For now it just checks a few things, but
we could extend this issue checking as we find other things to check on.

Also refactors the unused package tool to put some common things into a
shared function library used by both scripts.

Updating region/zone of a device is actually implemented and supported
in swift, while puppet-swift doesn't support that operation yet.
This patch updates error messages when an operator tries to update
region/zone of a device, so that they notice more clearly that the
cause exists in puppet-swift, not in swift.

Since Ansible 2.7, there is a reboot module in Ansible which
handles the reboot of the host far better than older mechanisms.

The reboot module will:

1. Initiate the reboot
2. Wait until it can connect to the host again (with a timeout)
3. Run 'whoami' on the host to confirm connectivity

We need to run in quite tedious order to upgrade properly
the Pacemaker managed roles. First we split the environment
into Pacemaker enabled, Non-Pacemaker Non-Compute and Compute
groups of roles:

Pacemaker: ['Controller','Database','Messaging']
Non-Pacemaker&Non-Compute: ['Ceph','Networking','Objectstorage']
Compute: ['Compute','OSDCompute']

For Pacemaker we have to upgrade one of each roles in the Pacemaker
group together - controller-0,database-0,messaging-0 to ensure that
upgrade will work. We can run system upgrade in parallel on them
too.

The tricky part with Pacemaker is that than we need to run upgrade
on the one node of each role in the Pacemaker group but also on all
previous Pacemaker nodes to ensure we don't create several separated
clusters.

For the rest it's simply faster to run for each role in the group.

A new option added into leapp lets us configure a set of repositories to run
leapp with. This new option is compatible with rhos-release, removing the need
for an special leapp actor.
This patch checks the rhos-release repos configured locally in the Undercloud
and builds a --enablerepo string with all the repos obtained. This string is
then passed at the time of running leapp, if the machine isn't using a
subscription.

This patch also cleans up some unnecessary code to handle differente leapp
versions, as our CI now works with latest leapp version. As well as some
unsupported Leapp environment variables [0].

EC2 token requests contain a signature that signs the entire request,
including the access timestamp. While the signature is checked, the
timestamp is not, and so these signed requests remain valid
indefinitely, leaving the token API vulnerable to replay attacks. This
change introduces a configurable TTL for signed token requests and
ensures that the timestamp is actually validated against it.

The check will work for either an AWS Signature v1/v2 'Timestamp'
parameter[1] or the AWS Signature v4 'X-Aws-Date' header or
parameter[2].

Although this technically adds a new feature and the default value of
the feature changes behavior, this change is required to protect
credential holders and therefore must be backported to all supported
branches.

This job was a legacy job that attempted to verify each project could be
independently installed after all global-requirements had been
installed.

This job is no longer necessary since we have much better coverage with
requirements-check and other jobs that make sure the requirements are
compatible. It is also a legacy zuulv2 job, uses the long deprecated
devstack-gate, and runs with Python 2.7.

During migration and manage/unmanage operations, if we used standard
extra_specs format (e.g. 'thin_provisioning'='True') instead of
NetApp based extra_specs format (e.g. 'netapp:thin_provisioned'='True'),
NetApp driver used to ignore these standard extra_specs settings
and continued the operation with the default option.
The driver is now fixed to handle this issue by honouring the
standard extra_specs during migration and manage/unmanage.

Starting from 16.0, OSP, the Red Hat version of tripleo, enforce
certain rules between Rhel version and OSP version.

Those checks rely on the Red Hat subscription mechanism.

To support CI when no subscription is apply we need to disable the
enforcement.  This is done by setting SkipRhelEnforcement to True.

So we add code here to disable the check by default for CI.

The new option --enforce-rhel set to yes make it possible to run the
update while keeping the enforcement to test subscribed environment.

This patch adds support for using mod_auth_openidc instead of shibboleth for
supporting users who have a preference to use oidc for federation. A new
variable called apache_mod is added to keystone_sp allowing the auth library
to be selected. If left undefined shibboleth auth module will continue to be
installed by default maintaining backward compatibility.

This patch does not support simultaneous use of shibboleth and mod_auth_openidc
primarily because shib2 depends on libcurl3 but mod_auth_openidc depends on
libcurl4 which cannot coexist on Ubuntu. This can be resolved when there is a
shib3 package available in a future release of Ubuntu.

on the devstack host.

On test machines, access to this NAS server is
firewalled from networks outside of the host's
internal network namespace (including from private
project networks that are in different network
namespaces, on the same devstack host).

We currently use a legacy devstack-gate script
to disable firewall on NFS ports; however,
anyone that installs devstack with LVM, Container,
ZFSOnLinux, CephFS-NFS drivers will need these
firewall ports to be opened to be able to mount
shares exported off their devstack host machines.

Move these firewall commands to the devstack plugin.
These commands can be invoked by setting the localrc
variable MANILA_ALLOW_NAS_SERVER_PORTS_ON_HOST to True.
The value of this variable is False by default,
to preserve existing behavior.

This change addresses several issues in the creation and use of EC2/S3
credentials with keystone tokens.

1. Disable altering credential owner attributes or metadata

Without this patch, an authenticated user can create an EC2 credential
for themself for a project they have a role on, then update the
credential to target a user and project completely unrelated to them. In
the worst case, this could be the admin user and a project the admin
user has a role assignment on. A token granted for an altered credential
like this would allow the user to masquerade as the victim user. This
patch ensures that when updating a credential, the new form of the
credential is one the acting user has access to: if the system admin
user is changing the credential, the new user ID or project ID could be
anything, but regular users may only change the credential to be one
that they still own.

Relatedly, when a user uses an application credential or a trust to
create an EC2 credential, keystone automatically adds the trust ID or
application credential ID as metadata in the EC2 access blob so that it
knows how the token can be scoped when it is used. Without this patch, a
user who has created a credential in this way can update the access blob
to remove or alter this metadata and escalate their privileges to be
fully authorized for the trustor's, application credential creator's, or
OAuth1 access token authorizor's privileges on the project. This patch
fixes the issue by simply disallowing updates to keystone-controlled
metadata in the credential.

2. Respect token roles when creating EC2 credentials

Without this patch, a trustee, an application credential user, or an
OAuth1 access token holder could create an EC2 credential or an
application credential using any roles the trustor, application
credential creator, or access token authorizor had on the project,
regardless of whether the creator had delegated only a limited subset of
roles. This was because the trust_id attribute of the EC2 access blob
was ignored, and no metadata for the application credential or access
token was recorded either. This change ensures that the access
delegation resource is recorded in the metadata of the EC2 credential
when created and passed to the token provider when used for
authentication so that the token provider can look up the correct roles
for the request.

In extreme cases of object rebalance or node failure, swift environments
with millions of objects may have a hard time with objects landing in
handoff or misplaced partitions and the operator of the cloud may need
to prioritize migrating data in handoff partitions back to primary
partitions over the 3 primary partitions replicating amongst each other.

To allow for this, the object-server.conf [object-replicator]
configuration can have handoffs_first set to True which will force
the object-replicators to focus on handoff partitions before syncing
primary partitions for any given object partition.

The purpose of this change is to fix the upgrade scenario
without breaking the existing validation for the
deployment phase.  During the upgrade from queens, the
default 'container_cli' is podman in the undercloud (which
is updated), but it's still docker in the overcloud and this
let the validation playbook to fail because we're computing
this fact starting from inventory_hostname that still points
to the undercloud.  This issue can be solved by removing the
delegation directive from tht and rely on tripleo delegate
wrapper.
This should be enough to access the overcloud (ceph_mon)
variables, setting the right fact.
