Shard shrinking can be instigated by a third party modifying shard
ranges, moving one shard to shrinking state and expanding the
namespace of one or more other shard(s) to act as acceptors. These
state and namespace changes must propagate to the shrinking and
acceptor shards. The shrinking shard must also discover the acceptor
shard(s) into which it will shard itself.

The sharder audit function already updates shards with their own state
and namespace changes from the root. However, there is currently no
mechanism for the shrinking shard to learn about the acceptor(s) other
than by a PUT request being made to the shrinking shard container.

This patch modifies the shard container audit function so that other
overlapping shards discovered from the root are merged into the
audited shard's db. In this way, the audited shard will have acceptor
shards to cleave to if shrinking.

This new behavior is restricted to when the shard is shrinking. In
general, a shard is responsible for processing its own sub-shard
ranges (if any) and reporting them to root. Replicas of a shard
container synchronise their sub-shard ranges via replication, and do
not rely on the root to propagate sub-shard ranges between shard
replicas. The exception to this is when a third party (or
auto-sharding) wishes to instigate shrinking by modifying the shard
and other acceptor shards in the root container.  In other
circumstances, merging overlapping shard ranges discovered from the
root is undesirable because it risks shards inheriting other unrelated
shard ranges. For example, if the root has become polluted by
split-brain shard range management, a sharding shard may have its
sub-shards polluted by an undesired shard from the root.

During the shrinking process a shard range's own shard range state may
be either shrinking or, prior to this patch, sharded. The sharded
state could occur when one replica of a shrinking shard completed
shrinking and moved the own shard range state to sharded before other
replica(s) had completed shrinking. This makes it impossible to
distinguish a shrinking shard (with sharded state), which we do want
to inherit shard ranges, from a sharding shard (with sharded state),
which we do not want to inherit shard ranges.

This patch therefore introduces a new shard range state, 'SHRUNK', and
applies this state to shard ranges that have completed shrinking.
Shards are now restricted to inherit shard ranges from the root only
when their own shard range state is either SHRINKING or SHRUNK.

This patch also:

 - Stops overlapping shrinking shards from generating audit warnings:
   overlaps are cured by shrinking and we therefore expect shrinking
   shards to sometimes overlap.

 - Extends an existing probe test to verify that overlapping shard
   ranges may be resolved by shrinking a subset of the shard ranges.

 - Adds a --no-auto-shard option to swift-container-sharder to enable the
   probe tests to disable auto-sharding.

 - Improves sharder logging, in particular by decrementing ranges_todo
   when a shrinking shard is skipped during cleaving.

 - Adds a ShardRange.sort_key class method to provide a single definition
   of ShardRange sort ordering.

 - Improves unit test coverage for sharder shard auditing.

Ports with device_owner like:
* floating_ip,
* DHCP,
* some types of router ports, like: HA interface interface,
* distributed ports,
don't need to be configured in the dnsmasq file.
So there is no need to reload dnsmasq every time when such port is
added/updated to the network.

This patch adds skip in such case which should improve load on the
Neutron DHCP agent.

1. When dvr router is disabled and enabled back, the rfp
interfaces are deleted on the nodes without snat-* namespace.
This is due to creation of snat namespace during router
initialization stage on all the nodes. At later stages, since
the gw_port_host is not bounded on this node, external gateway
is removed which triggers removal of rfp interfaces and snat
namespace.
Create snat namespace only on the nodes where gw_port_host is
bounded.

2. In case of DVR SNAT, when the l3 agent is rescheduled to
another node, the rfp interfaces on qrouter-* namespace are
removed. Instead of calling external_gateway_removed() which
further deletes the rfp interfaces, the qg-, sg- interfaces
need to be unplugged and snat namespace need to be deleted.

Glance has a vestigial policy override knob that allows an operator
to force a 403 response when attempting to get an image from the DB
that is not found. This runs contrary to the API documentation, and
creates a (potential) interoperability concern across clouds with
differing policies on this topic.

This removes that override and changes the test from validating this
override to validating that it can no longer happen.

The CONF.compute.max_disk_devices_to_attach option controls the maximum
number of disk devices allowed to attach to an instance. If it is set
to 0, it will literally allow no disk device for instances, preventing
them from being able to boot.

This adds a note to the config option help to call this out and changes
nova-compute to raise InvalidConfiguration during init_host if
[compute]max_disk_devices_to_attach has been set to 0. The nova-compute
service will fail to start if the option is set to 0.

Note: there doesn't appear to be any way to disallow particular values
in a oslo.config IntOpt other than the min/max values. Here we need the
min value to be -1 to represent unlimited. There is a 'choices' kwarg
available but that is only for enumerating valid values and we need to
allow any integer >= 1 as well.

When an operator does a `find_and_replace` on a DB that already has
shard ranges, they get a prompt like:

   Do you want to show the existing ranges [s], delete the existing
   ranges [yes] or quit without deleting [q]?

Previously, if they selected `q`, we would skip the delete but still do

ranges. Now, quit without merging.

Remove the 'test_tcp_rst_no_compute_rpcapi' test case. This test is not
correct. The 'self.wh' object is set to a proxy class that we mock to
inherit from a 'Mock' object, so unset variables are returned as mocked
values, which suggests this doesn't appear to have been testing what it
was expected to be testing. Along with a subtle change in Python 3.8 to
how this is mocked, the only way to get the test to pass would be to
mock the return value we are checking, so we would just be testing that
mocking works. This should probably be reimplemented as a functional
test since it tries to reach into external code to manipulate results.

Extended boot records (EBRs) are used in the MSDOS partitioning
scheme to manage extended partitions. EBRs are small partitions
themselves and Ironic will therefore treat them like any other
partition during cleaning. Since EBRs are smaller than a GPT
(33 sectors), dd'ing 33 sectors will fail. This patch proposes
a fix to handle EBRs (and other tiny paritions) by adjusting
the number of blocks writtent to be the partition size at max.

* Fix unitentional mgmt_calls in vnflcm_driver._scale_vnf_pre

Note:
* For UT, sqlalchemy is used, which calls functions in pymysql.py,
  so the dependency module PyMySQL needs to be added.
* The previous implementation of ``cfg.CONF.tacker.infra_driver``
  depends on the default config in legacy ``VNFMPlugin`` class in
  tacker/vnfm/plugin.py, so we need to fix this here.
* Due to drop unitentional mgmt_calls, it makes compatibility breakage
  for some scale actions calls and third party driver support. This
  backward incompatibility was decided to keep since it is not long
  time since last change(Victoria release)

By default, the ReaR rpm installs a cronjob on /etc/cron.d/rear with
a default programming. This programming runs a backup job at
1:30AM every day. During this automatic backup, the services are not
appropiately paused. This causes the created backup to have non-valid
data.

As the most recent backup overwrites the older ones, this deletes
the ""good"" backup taken at operator's discretion with a new one
that cannot be used to restore the control plane state.

This change aims to optionally disable this default rpm behaviour.

This change include the fix about the wrong client package name in unit
tests[1].

But when the ceph-nfs pcmk resource gets created at step 5, the

When doing multipathed Fibre Channel we may end up not flushing the
volume when disconnecting it if didn't find a multipath when doing
the connection.

The issue is caused by the `connect_volume` call returning a real path
instead of a symlink and us passing the wrong device_info to the
_remove_devices method, which makes the disconnect code incorrectly
identify when a multipath was used to decide whether to do a flush or
not.

This patch fixes these things in order to flush the individual path when
necessary.

	When create load balancer, task flows don’t have Mark***ActiveInDB except MarkLBActiveInDB, it calls _mark_l7policy_status(), _mark_l7rule_status() and _mark_hm_status().

	According to classes Mark****ActiveInDB in this octavia/controller/worker/tasks/database_tasks.py, healthmonitor l7policy and l7rule updated its status, but there is no update operating_status in _mark_l7policy_status(), _mark_l7rule_status() and _mark_hm_status().

This commit updates the policies for baremetal nodes to understand
scope checking and account for a member or read-only role.

This is part of a broader series of changes across OpenStack
to provide a consistent RBAC experience and improve security.

This change also implements basic testing of the RBAC interface, and
modifies the testing test_acl.py file to *both* delineate the tests
to prevent yaml variable expansion collission as well as handle
deprecated ACL testing so we can track our way through the API
and disable deprecated tests from providing false errors.

A notable difference between the testing is that members in the
system role *have* rights under the system scope. Members accounts
may be services such as nova-compute running the nova.virt.ironic
driver.

1. When dvr router is disabled and enabled back, the rfp
interfaces are deleted on the nodes without snat-* namespace.
This is due to creation of snat namespace during router
initialization stage on all the nodes. At later stages, since
the gw_port_host is not bounded on this node, external gateway
is removed which triggers removal of rfp interfaces and snat
namespace.
Create snat namespace only on the nodes where gw_port_host is
bounded.

2. In case of DVR SNAT, when the l3 agent is rescheduled to
another node, the rfp interfaces on qrouter-* namespace are
removed. Instead of calling external_gateway_removed() which
further deletes the rfp interfaces, the qg-, sg- interfaces
need to be unplugged and snat namespace need to be deleted.

This is a follow up patch to also allow the reconstructor to send hashes
via json. However there is a problem. The hashes.pkl format we've
decided to use for EC doesn't nicely support json's definition of dicts.

In the json standard the keys in a dict will always be returned as a str.
So we can't have None or frag indexes as ints. So when json loads our hashes
json back they wont come back as None and ints, ranther ""null"" and ""<int>"".

I've added a sanitize_json_dict method which sanitizes a json loaded
hashes dict to fix these issues.

The output from swift-manage-shard-ranges compact was hard to read,
particularly with long lower and upper bounds typically seen in
production.  This patch changes the output, most significantly by
aligning lower and upper bounds at the end of lines and printing
donors before acceptors, so that the continuity of shard range bounds
is easier to see.

Example of new ouput:

Donor shard range(s) with total of 2 objects:
  objects: 2         lower: ''
    state: active    upper: 'obj-0001'
can be compacted into acceptor shard range:
  objects: 2         lower: 'obj-0001'
    state: active    upper: 'obj-0003'
Donor shard range(s) with total of 2 objects:
  objects: 2         lower: 'obj-0003'
    state: active    upper: 'obj-0005'
can be compacted into acceptor shard range:
  objects: 2         lower: 'obj-0005'
    state: active    upper: ''

This  patch adds shrinking candidates to the sharding recon dump
shrinking candidates will always be SHARDED root containers. And
get added to the candidate list if they have any ranges that are
compactible, that is to say they have ranges that can be compacted into
an upper neighbour.

The shrinking_candidates data comes out something like:

 {
    'found': 1,
    'top': [
	{
	    'object_count': <some number>,
	    'account': 'a',
	    'meta_timestamp': <ts1>,
	    'container': 'c',
	    'file_size': <something>,
	    'path': <something>,
	    'root': <something>,
	    'node_index': 0,
	    'compactible_ranges': 2
	}]
 }

In this case 'compactible_ranges' is the number of donors that can be shrunk
in a single command.

Currently if we put a path separator in slug, ""reno new"" command
creates subdirectories under the notes subdirectory. This usually
results in the situation where the note file is put to an unexpected
place.
For example we have seen several cases with reno files placed under
releasenote/notes/releasenote/notes directory because the notes
subdirectory path is accidentally included in slug, like;

$ reno new releasenotes/notes/something-new
no configuration file in: ./releasenotes/config.yaml, ./reno.yaml
Created new notes file in releasenotes/notes/releasenotes/notes/something-new-2ff053c99583fc69.yaml

This change prohibits users from creating such subdirectries under
the notes subdirectory. The previous behavior can be restored by
the allow_subdirectories config option.

The CONF.compute.max_disk_devices_to_attach option controls the maximum
number of disk devices allowed to attach to an instance. If it is set
to 0, it will literally allow no disk device for instances, preventing
them from being able to boot.

This adds a note to the config option help to call this out and changes
nova-compute to raise InvalidConfiguration during init_host if
[compute]max_disk_devices_to_attach has been set to 0. The nova-compute
service will fail to start if the option is set to 0.

Note: there doesn't appear to be any way to disallow particular values
in a oslo.config IntOpt other than the min/max values. Here we need the
min value to be -1 to represent unlimited. There is a 'choices' kwarg
available but that is only for enumerating valid values and we need to
allow any integer >= 1 as well.

In I12a02f636f31985bc1b71bff5b744d346286a95f cell_v2 discovery was
originally moved from the nova-api container to the
nova-compute|nova-ironic containers in order to run cell
discovery during a scale up where the controllers are omitted
(e.g to exclude the controllers from a maintenance window).

This requires api database credentials on the compute node, which is
forbidden, so it must move back to a nova-api host as a pre-requisite
for removing these credentials in a follow-up patch.

Scale-up while omitting the controllers will no longer work out of the
box. Either a manual cell_v2 discovery can be run after scale up, or an
additional node can be deployed using the NovaManager tripleo role.

Added a new section to the documentation introducing the core
concepts of DNS, providing an overview of Designate and how
it integrates with Neutron and external nameservers and linking
to other documentation for more information.

The Designate architecture diagram has been updated to reflect
modern deployments:
  - All services are run as HA
  - Nova does not interact with the Designate API, it has been
    replaced with 'Users'
  - The DB only receives connections from MiniDNS or Central so
    its arrows are all incoming
  - The backend is a part of the worker service
  - MiniDNS sends NOTIFY to customer DNS Servers and
    also receives transfer requests so their connection is
    bidirectional

A subsequent change can update the architecture section to reflect
these clarifications, though they are for the most part already
mentioned in the text there.

We need to specify doc requirements in doc/requirements.txt
to avoid problems with the pip resolver [1] for the release team [2][3].

Removing specific doc requirements from test-requirements.txt.

The problem here is that this repos haven't doc/requirements.txt file
and by default in this case zuul will use the test-requirements.txt file
to pull requirements [4].

This requirements file contains extra requirements like flake8 that
collided with those allowed in our job environment and so the new pip
resolver fails to install these requirements and the job exits in error.

This project meet the conditions leading to the bug.

The get_uefi_disk_identifier function is currently unused in both

the UEFI partition UUID, not the disk identifier, unlike the
similarly named get_disk_identifier.

This change imports get_efi_part_on_device from IPA as
find_efi_partition. The only difference is that it returns
a complete partition record rather than only the number.

Verification structure will be:
- 'devstack-IPv6' deploy the service on IPv6
- 'devstack-tempest-ipv6' run will verify the IPv6-only setting and listen address
- 'monascalog-tempest-ipv6-only' will run the tests.

Right now, the metadata agent sets the external_ids:iface-id
on the localport and that creates a local binding in OVN.

While this is ok, it is not needed and hence this patch is
removing it for simplicity and avoid creating local bindings
in OVN.

This requires stackhpc.os-images v1.10.0 or newer, for compatibility
with CentOS 8 when SELinux is enabled: we disable SELinux, but without
rebooting it stays enabled.

This Ansible role was updated to v1.10.2 in master and stable/victoria
by I5efdbd52556721914fe69d7c6ba454b2c721b643, for another reason.
Remember to bump the requirement when backporting to earlier releases.

It also needs changes in the way we interact with Bifrost to avoid using
the env-vars file which has been removed. This is implemented by change
I25078e69acdf41a4ef9957f99fe5047de54b778d.

Finally, it requires building seed deployment images only after
deploying Bifrost, because the task copying images onto the seed expects
/etc/kolla/bifrost to exist.

We also copy log files to identify issues when the job fails.

The may_exist parameter of the create_lrouter() comment defaults to
True. This parameter should check if a logical router already exists and
not attempt to create it again in OVN.

But, while checking if the router already exists, the AddLRouterCommand
command for OVSDB uses a method called row_by_value() which will raise
RowNotFound if the entry is not in the OVN database. This error wasn't
being hanlded by the AddLRouterCommand code and the exception bubbled up.

This patch fixes the problem by adding an error handler around the
row_by_value() call, just like all other calls from that method in the
same file.

Passing this data to the repo server generates a file at
/var/www/repo/constraints/upper-constraints-<SHA>.txt which can
then be retrieved from the repo server internal endpoint.

This allows the openstack service roles all of which need the
url of the upper constraints file to use the locally cached
copy served from the repo server rather than use an external
service.

When the location of the openstack requirements repo is a
filesystem reference ('file://....') then the constraints file
is retrieved from locally rather than being downloaded with a
network connection. This should prevent CI failures which
occur when the upstream u-c file is unavailable.

Fix the find_compactible_shard_sequences function to prevent skipping
a shard range after finding a sequence of compactible shard ranges
that approaches the merge size.

Previously a compactible sequence would correctly terminate on the nth
shard range if the n+1th shard range would take the object count over
the merge_size, but the n+1th shard range would then be skipped and
not considered for the start of the next sequence.

Starting with the Mimic release and the Ceph RBD clone v2 feature,
it is no longer necessary to manage snapshot protection status.
The usage of clone v2 is controlled via the Ceph “rbd default
clone format” configuration option which defaults to “auto”, but
can be overridden to “1” to force the legacy clone v1 behavior or
“2” to force the new clonev2 behavior.

This must be configured in Ceph, it's not something that can be
configured on the Cinder side.

As an alternative, setting the minimum client to mimic
""$ ceph osd set-require-min-compat-client mimic""

Above all with Ceph RBD clone v2 support enabled, image snapshots
can be cloned without marking the snapshot as protected because
RBD automatically tracks the usage of the snapshot by clones. As
a result Ceph RBD clone v2 API improves performance.

This proposed patch adds logging messages for the operator
indicating whether Ceph has been configured to use the Ceph RBD
v2 clone feature.

In this way the operator can consult with the Ceph administrator
to take appropriate action.

You can determine which volumes are using the clone v2 feature
thanks to volume.volume.op_features(). It returns a value depending
on the v2 clone api being enabled or not.

Also includes squash to fix unit test from:

1. When dvr router is disabled and enabled back, the rfp
interfaces are deleted on the nodes without snat-* namespace.
This is due to creation of snat namespace during router
initialization stage on all the nodes. At later stages, since
the gw_port_host is not bounded on this node, external gateway
is removed which triggers removal of rfp interfaces and snat
namespace.
Create snat namespace only on the nodes where gw_port_host is
bounded.

2. In case of DVR SNAT, when the l3 agent is rescheduled to
another node, the rfp interfaces on qrouter-* namespace are
removed. Instead of calling external_gateway_removed() which
further deletes the rfp interfaces, the qg-, sg- interfaces
need to be unplugged and snat namespace need to be deleted.

This patch automatically detects if the deployment is running in
zuul CI  and uses the locally available git repo to get a copy
of upper-constraints.txt if possible.

A copy of the upper-constraints.txt file is placed in /opt for
all deployments both in and out of CI, and is used as the source
of constraints when creating the ansible runtime venv.

This reduces the need to make requests for the same data to the
opendev.org git servers which will improve CI job reliability.

DIB dropped Python 2 support in its version 3.0.0 major release and as
so we had to pin it to 2.30.0 in stable/stein and stable/train branches.
However, upstream get-pip.sh recently introduced a regression where it
does not work well with Python <= 3.5. Sadly, DIB 2.30.0 points to
master get-pip.sh [1] and DIB is branchless so the fix cannot be
backported and we are in a deadlock scenario where Python <= 3.5 amphora
images can't be built.

To work-around this issue on Stein and Train releases, we have to make a
compromise: either build amphora images using master DIB and Python
>=3.6 only or be stuck (unless someone else can come up with another
approach, all ears). Ussuri and newer releases are not impacted by this
issue as they are Python >=3.6 only releases.

Additionally, in the process of fixing Stein CI jobs we noticed that
octavia-v1-dsvm-scenario jobs were still running on Ubuntu Xenial
(Python 3.5!) but should have been on Bionic. The nodeset was updated to
Bionic-based but yet they continued to fail. For unknown reasons, Zuul
didn't collect CI log files so we couldn't troubleshoot the issue
further (infra team was pinged on IRC, no response). Given that Stein is
in extended maintenance and these jobs are neutron-lbaas (EOLd), we have
reasons to believe there is no one interested in maintaining these jobs
to the level worth keeping them as voting.

I668643c836d46a25df46d4c99a973af5e50a39db attempted to fix service wide
pauses by providing a more complete list of classes to tpool.Proxy.

While this excluded libvirtError it can include internal libvirt-python
classes pointed to by private globals that have been introduced with the
use of type checking within the module.

Any attempt to wrap these internal classes will result in the failure
seen in bug #1901383. As a result this change simply ignores any class
found during inspection that doesn't start with the `vir` string, used
by libvirt to denote public methods and classes.

This pull request adds support for the OpenID Connect authentication
flow in Keystone and enables both ID and access token authentication
flows. The ID token configuration is designed to allow users to
authenticate via Horizon using an identity federation; whereas the
Access token is used to allow users to authenticate in the OpenStack CLI
using a federated user.

Without this PR, if one wants to configure OpenStack to use identity
federation, he/she needs to do a lot of configurations in the keystone,
Horizon, and register quite a good number of different parameters using
the CLI such as mappings, identity providers, federated protocols, and
so on. Therefore, with this PR, we propose a method for operators to
introduce/present the IdP's metadata to Kolla-ansible, and based on the
presented metadata, Kolla-ansible takes care of all of the
configurations to prepare OpenStack to work in a federated environment.

DIB dropped Python 2 support in its version 3.0.0 major release and as
so we had to pin it to 2.30.0 in stable/stein and stable/train branches.
However, upstream get-pip.sh recently introduced a regression where it
does not work well with Python <-3.5. Sadly, DIB 2.30.0 points to master
get-pip.sh [1] and DIB is branchless so the fix cannot be backported and
we are in a deadlock scenario where Python <=3.5 amphora images can't be
built.

To work-around this issue on stable/train, we have to make a compromise:
either build amphora images using master DIB and Python 3 only or be
stuck (unless someone else can come up with another approach, all ears).
Ussuri and newer releases are not impacted by this issue as they are
Python >=3.6 only releases.

The same issue also applies to Stein and that has an impact on the
octavia-grenade CI job in stable/train. Since Stein Octavia is EOL [2],
we no longer have to test upgrades.

This change starts to record the machine type of instances registered on
a given host during init_host or later in _configure_guest_by_virt_type
when spawning a new instance.

The machine type is recorded in the system metadata of the instance
under the ``image_hw_machine_type`` key as already used to store the
image metadata property ``hw_machine_type``. As a result no changes are
required to the code of libvirt_utils.get_machine_type that looks up the
machine type of an instance based on it's image metadata and host
config.

Functional tests are included to verify the basic behaviour of both this
new registration code and now this leads to instances being effectively
pinned to the machine type used during their initial spawn.

In case when security group is removed from port, connections
established to/from port which were hitting some of the removed SG
rules will be marked with CT_MARK_INVALID in the conntrack table.
Due to that such existing connections will be stopped.
But then if SG will be added again to the port, those conntrack entries
marked as invalid will not be removed and those hang connections will
not be revived.
To fix that, this patch adds deletion of the conntrack entries marked

This change implements missing external_upgrade_tasks for non-pcmk
services of manila and cinder, to ensure that we don't have mixed
versions of controller services running at the same time during
upgrade.

These tasks should have been implemented in the initial patch[1], but
missed at that time unfortunately.

We create volume backup failed when we enable TLS.
The reason is that we can't set the swift endpoint type, and default is

For more security, we should set the swift endpoint type is internal

So we should let the operator set the swift endpoint type.

Restored_key_id is taken from backup's ""volume base metadata"". It's backup
source volume's encryption_key_id. If we use it as backup‘s encryption_key_id,

Patch [1] added possibility that haproxy spawned as metadata proxy in
the router's namespace can be bound to IPv6 address.
We misssed to add the same for the HA router, so when router was
switched to be active on the node, L3 agent starts haproxy for that
router but it was always bound to IPv4 address only.
That patch fixes it by adding check if IPv6 is enabled on host, and if
yes, it adds same config to the haproxy like it is in non-ha mode.

Due to old bug in how Ironic was deploying nodes the UEFI based
deployments have very wrong setup.
1) The nodes were installed via grub-install command which
   assembles grub binary instead of providing the signed one.
   It also creates efi recod with only ""red"" in it like:
   /File(\EFI\red\grubx64.efi)
2) The partition hosting /boot/efi was never added to fstab
   resulting in this partition never being mounted even if it was
   used to boot the system. There were no updates done to the
   binaries and no configuration.

This patch tries to check for this specific setup and if it's the
case we create fstab record, mount the partition, copy the original
filesystem structure on it, create proper boot record pointing to
\redhat\ and write grub.cfg for it.

Replace in-charm SR-IOV code with the common ``SRIOVContext``

Do not do run-time configuration of SR-IOV or hardware adaption
for hardware offload. In addition to being detrimental to any
virtual machine instance consuming the VF this will break NIC
firmware in some configurations.

The task is delegated to the installed packages and their systemd
services and configuration will occur at system bootup time.

We may consider adding an action to perform the configuration at
run-time if the operator really wants to, but it is very
complicated to get right. For example if you are using bonding
and hardware offload the virtual functions and hardware specific
setup has to happen _BEFORE_ netplan applies network configuration
to the system.
