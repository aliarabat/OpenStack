When the openstack-ansible-security role became ansible-hardening,
a new config block was added to `/etc/profile` without removing
the original one with the openstack-ansible-security markers. This
causes errors on the command prompt since `TMOUT` is defined twice.

This patch removes the old config block using blockinfile.

This fix allows user to have secure communication with CoprHD with
either self signed certificate or CA verified trusted certificate.

User needs to mention 2 parameters in the cinder.config file for this.
The first parameter to tell if certificate verification is needed at all
and second parameter specifies the path to the self signed certificate.

If first parameter is true and the second parameter is set to None
then its assumed that the CoprHD CA signed certificate authority is
present in the trusted certs store of client.

When running the role using a specific tag (eg -t auth), some tasks
try to check the status of the async ones and they fail because the
async task was never executed due to missing the 'always' tag. We can
fix that by adding the missing tags to the async tasks.

For example,

TASK [ansible-hardening : Remove .shosts or shosts.equiv files]
******************************************************************************************************************************
fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {""failed"": true, ""msg"": ""'job_result' is undefined""}

So we add the appropriate tags to the async tasks.

openstackclient.api.versions implements some common discovery functions
that may move into keystoneauth someday.  It is based on ideas from
novaclient and cinderclient api_versions, and the APIVersion class is
directly lifted from there.  Exceptions have been changed to use ksa
exceptions or define new ones.

Convert compute.client to use api.versions rather than novaclient for
version validation and discovery.

discover_version() has changed in that it no longer considers the
client min/max versions as this is meant to be a general-use function.
get_range_overlap() has been added to perform this check so the
can first validate the version it is requesting.

Includes an example to compare novaclient with api.versions.

the non-admin tenants list the share networks and security

While looking at Idd856e897ff97095fb116294a9187ff4b198fa26 I realised
that our checking is picking up on embedded awk programs.

For something like this, I think we should be able to skip individual
tests just for a single file.

To achieve this, we keep a list of tests to ignore from the command
line, and append any tests we see from a special comment line as
described in the documentation.

One change is making it explicit that tests to ignore should be
separated by commas.  We don't want to mix ""|"" matching in there, as
that is exposing the implementation details of the regex-search.
Documentation is updated to make this clear, and test-cases modified.

This also includes a man page for bashate.1 which also describes these
usage details, and links this from the readme.

This patch add OpenStack Policy engine into keystaoneauth
without altering the external interface of the middleware
I.E: Only the internal implementation of the authorization checks
was changed, the middleware parameters and unittests 
remain the same.

How does it work:
* ""authorize"" method were re-implemented to use an ""enforcer""
which is base on the json policy format defined in OpenStack.
* All keystoneauth authorisations logic were translated into json policy 
format, to ensure backward compatibly.
* No change to the middleware parameter were done for now, 
when the middleware is called with its usual parameters 
(operator_roles, reseller_role, and is_admin) 
we pass those parameter to the enforcer, which know how to 
translate them into the corresponding json policy format, and then 
apply checks based on the result.

(In a next patch we would like to address the second step of the blue
print which is allowing to specify a json policy file as a parameter of
the middleware and handle authorization according to that file).

Partially implements bp authorization-policy

This adds a VHDUtilImageManager class that supports writing out tar
files that contain vhds. This relies on a 3rd party tool, 'vhd-util',
and patches to that utility.

A script to build vhd-util exists here:

https://github.com/comstud/libvhd-builder

That will clone the appropriate repo for vhd-util and build it, as long
as you have the correct dependencies (documented in the build script).

The vhd-util binary will need to be put into the following directory
within the agent code (create the missing directories):

imagebuild/coreos/oem/vhd-util/1.0

before building the agent image.

openstack%2Fswift~master~I769680790b9549109a579d410f8a75fac745eb3d,openstack/swift,master,O_DIRECT,I769680790b9549109a579d410f8a75fac745eb3d,O_DIRECT: Use O_DIRECT for reading and writing object data.,NEW,2014-04-28 20:01:23.000000000,2017-12-18 12:16:04.000000000,,93,8,3,81111,0e098aaeef9ed02288dbdb5b3d70ec28574ff0b0,8,2,1,1,10831,Kurt Miller,bsdkurt,"O_DIRECT: Use O_DIRECT for reading and writing object data.

For reading, if disk_chunk_size is 4K aligned allocate a read buffer that is 4K
aligned using mmap and set the file descriptor flags to include O_DIRECT. If
there is an exception reading while O_DIRECT is set, it could be because the
seek alignment is not 4K aligned, so disable O_DIRECT and perform a standard
read.

For writing large files (>= network_chunk_size), if network_chunk_size is 4K
aligned then O_DIRECT will be used for network_chunk_size chunks. If the last
chunk smaller then network_chunk_size, then O_DIRECT will be disabled and a
normal write used instead. For small files (< network_chunk_size), if the file
size is a multiple of 4K it will attempt to write using O_DIRECT, otherwise a
normal write will be used.

There are at least two ways this diff could be improved. Currently
network_chunk_size is not known at the diskfile.py layer so for writing the
buffer is allocated at 4K then increased to chunk length when the first write
comes in (assuming chunk length is 4K aligned). This double allocation could be
removed if network_chunk_size was available at this layer.

The 4K alignment was selected because O_DIRECT requires memory alignment to
match the sector size of the underlying block device. This could be queried
using BLKSSZGET ioctl, but this seemed a bit excessive to do for each file, so
I used a fixed 4K value which covers both 512 byte sectors and 4K sectors.

Testing on a 5 storage node cluster improved read performance between 2.5x and
5x using large files. Rate limiting was disabled in the proxy and object and
client chunk sizes set to 16K. Object servers used 2MB disk and network chunk
sizes and 8 threads per disk.

WIP because:
(a) we need to decide if this is the right thing to do.
(b) I have a concern about a potential race, called out
in the probe test.

Fix a KeyError when reconstructor attempted to revert
to another handoff node (which has no 'index' key) by
setting the node's index to the job's frag_index.

This means that reconstructor will now attempt reverts to
another handoff. Those reverts may result in HTTP_CONFLICT
if the other handoff has another fragment for the same object.
That causes ssync to fail and return an empty dict of in sync
objects, even when *some* fragments were successfully reverted.
That results in those fragments being duplicated on both handoff
nodes.

So, this patch also changes ssync_sender to return the dict of
objects that are known to be in sync, regardless of the outcome
of its updates. This at least means that duplicate fragments will
be cleaned up on a subsequent reconstructor run.

Better, but not yet implemented here, would be for ssync_sender to
also include objects that were successfuly sync'd during the updates
phase. That will require the ssync_receiver returning individual
subrequest response status.

NOTE2: Tests still need to be added.

This middleware intercepts requests for a container marked for
sharding and redirects the request to one of the potentially many
container ""shards"" to distribute the containers contents over the
cluster.

To do this, this middleware uses the same path hashing and part_power
mechanisms other parts of swift uses. But in this case the part_power
(or in this case the shard-power) is configured on a per container
level.

A sharded container can only be specified at container creation time
(for the moment) and is done by setting the
X-Container-Meta-Shard-Power header on container PUT.

      -H ""X-Container-Meta-Shard-Power: 2""  $STORAGE_URL/Acct/cont

Once created, when an object is then put into the container, the hash
is calculated and the shard-power is used to generate a 'shard'
number. Which determines which container shard to store this object
in. If the container shard doesn't exist it is created with all the
metadata settings of the main container and the shard number is then
added to the list of shards stored in sysmeta-shards
(which is stored as a json list) inside the shard container.

When a request is issued to the shard container (/Acct/cont above)
directly, the list of shards is iterated and it is run on all shard
containers. When its a container listing the bodies from all
sub-requests are returned.

This leads to a downside to this sharding middleware, the container
listings returned will not be properly sorted, the result of each
sub request will break when they are all combined.
Taking the diagram above as an example:

  curl -i -X GET -H ""X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN"" $STORAGE_URL/Acct/cont

  Obj1
  Obj3
  Obj2
  Obj4

In this version of the code, limit and markers don't work as
expected as they are loaded into the SQL statement used in each
container shard database. I can do some hacking to get limit to work
but that might not be too useful without markers working.

The current code as it is, isn't intercepting account listings so at
the moment the account listing will display the shard container and
the container shards. E.g:

  curl -i -X GET -H ""X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN"" $STORAGE_URL/Acct

  cont
  cont_shard_0
  cont_shard_1

This new patch simplifies the paco PUT path by assuming that a paco
node is also a 1-replica node (e.g., swift-on-file). This allows us
to bypass much of the PUT code to setup connections, send data and
get responses.

To test, create a new policy with one replica, also create a file
under /etc/swift/single-process.conf with the configuration for the
new 'in-process' object server.

Currently, only PUT and GET path have been coded, next will be
POST, DELETE

    Enable oslo_middleware proxy header parsing

""Heat has moved to using oslo_middleware for the http proxy header
parsing, however the default is to not parse the headers.  When
the external protocol differs from the internal protocol this
parsing is required in order for heat to work properly since it
will return 302 redirects to the client during some operations
(such as delete stack).

An example of this is when using haproxy with https configured
for the external protocol and http for the internal protocol.
If the oslo_middleware does not parse the headers, then any
302 redirects would specify a url with http rather than
correctly specifying https and the heat client would fail to
connect on the redirect url.""

When setting an instance password via the metadata service, if the
instance is not found it results in a 500 response to the caller.

This change handles the InstanceNotFound error and returns it as
a 400. Note it's a 400 since the instance uuid is part of the POST
request body, not on the URL path so it's not a 404 response.

The _wrap_target_cell() helper in the CellDatabases fixture was
accidentally changing the behavior of the target_cell() functionality
that it wraps by swallowing any exceptions raised and always returning
None. That was not intentional, and introduced by copying the exception
handler below a special case and returning None in a finally: context.

This just removes that exception handler to allow it to propagate to
the caller (as it would in production code), but returns (the
intended special case) if nothing is raised.

This also fixes a bit of the instance_list module that was working around
this quirk so that the code is more natural.

Conflicts:
      nova/compute/instance_list.py

NOTE(mriedem): nova/compute/instance_list.py didn't exist in Pike
and isn't needed here, we just need the fixture fix.

same node. (nova_compute and nova_compute_ironic)

This is because two compute containers use same hostname
in nova.conf.
To solve this problem, it will be modified host item in nova.conf
of nova_compute_ironic.

The error response generation in all the servers inside swift is pretty
much inconsistent. They don't respect the accept header of the request.
In some parts, the accept header isn't passed to the backend server at all.
Some parts, even when the backend server responds with a proper format
response such as JSON, and sets the content-type also accordingly, the proxy
server overwrites it with the standard text/html content-type. Some parts,
we always hard code and return text/plain error response, irrespective of the
content type asked. This is a attempt to fix all those inconsistencies
and starting it from the object server. This particular patch does the
below two things:

1. swob.py used to send HTML boilerplate text with message embedded
for all non 2xx error responses. This change checks if the Accept
header is set to 'application/json' and if yes, send a JSON response
in format,
 {""status"" : status, ""title"" : error_name,
 	     	     ""description"" : error_message }
2. Automate error response formatting inside the HTTPException class.
Instead of passing the whole body text, the servers can now specify
a error_msg argument, and the swob.HTTPException would take care of
guessing the correct content-type and formatting the body. This also
means text/plain remains the default format, when no other content-type
or accept header is specified. So, this maintains backwards
compatibility with the existing tests.

Currently, when ""swift-init restart <service(s)>"" is run and any of
services selected don't stop cleanly (generally due to taking longer
than the max time of 15sec), the code still tries to start a new
process and the following is observed:

Signal <service>  pid: <pid>  signal: X
Waited Y seconds for <service> to die; giving up
<service> running (<pid> - /etc/swift/<conf_file>)
<service> already started...

This can be misleading as it may be interpreted that the service
has been restarted. This change ensures that this does not happen
by changing the logic used in the ""restart"" function. The new
format checks each service selected individually and if the
particular service is not running, it will start a new process. If
the service has a process running, then the code will attempt to
stop this process. If it successfully stops this process, it will
start a new process, otherwise it will print a warning to the user
that the previous process could not be stopped and not bother
trying to start another one.

At the last hackathon there was some talk about pipelines.
I got to thinking of ways to tackle this, here is some code
I've been playing with (No TESTS). This change is marked WIP and may never
be merged, but wanted to put it up to at least start some discussions.

It might be a little over engineered, and I'm not sold on the idea,
but I thought it is an interesting POC and so wanted to share it.

This adds a new tool, swift-pipeline-audit, which takes in a config that
contains a pipeline ({proxy,object,container,account}-server.conf), and
audit the pipeline contained. It doesn't simply get a pipeline
because there is a few this it actually does:

 1. Validate that the required sections exist.
 2. Validate that the required entrypoints for each middleware exists.
 3. Then audits the pipeline by asking the middleware classes themselves.

By default, if incorrect, it will spit out in what position a middleware
should belong, or if it needs to be before, after, etc.
If you pass in a --correct flag, if the pipeline is incorrect it will
spit out a correct flag. This --correct flag could be removed and just
always spit out a corrected pipeline.

Instead of having a set of rules, the rules are stored inside the
middlewares themselves, so custom middlewares can easily take advantage
of the tool. To accomplish this all middleware now inherit from a
BaseMiddleware class. Those that don't still work and will be treated
and being in the NONE group, which wont attempt to be moved.

The BaseMiddleware class contains default filter values:

  class BaseMiddleware(object):
    # List of middleware class names that are required
    requires = []

    # List of middleware class names that this middleware should be
    # before if it appears in this pipeline.
    before = []

    # List of middleware class names that this middleware should be
    # after
    # if it appears in this pipeline.
    after = []

    # Group this middleware is apart of (see comment at top of file)
    group = NONE

The groups are as follows:
  NONE
    default, even for a middleware that doesn't inherit BaseMiddleware.
    Middleware in this group will be left alone.
  FIRST
    Middleware what should appear first (e.g gatekeeper and
    catch_errors)
  SHORT_CIRCUIT
    Middleware that respond to the user without hitting the app, and we
    want
    minimal processing when it does.
  PRE_AUTH
    Middleware what should appear before auth (e.g tempurl, formpost)
  AUTH
    Authentication middleware.
  POST_AUTH
    Middle that should sit post AUTH.
  LAST
    Middleware that should appear at the end of the pipeline.
  APP
    Application gets detected and marked, no middleware should get this
    group.

The current rules in this change haven't been fully thought out, but
enough to test. But it's easy to add more.

NOTE: Because proxy-logging appears twice, it was placed in the NONE group.

Here are some sample usages using the sample configs:

$ swift-pipeline-auditor etc/proxy-server.conf-sample --correct

Middleware proxy-logging isn't a member of a group, so it will be up to
  you to make sure it is in the correct position.
Middleware proxy-logging isn't a member of a group, so it will be up to
  you to make sure it is in the correct position.
Middleware ratelimit needs to move to position 8
Middleware tempauth needs to move to position 9
Middleware bulk needs to move to position 10
Current pipeline: catch_errors gatekeeper healthcheck proxy-logging
  cache container_sync bulk tempurl ratelimit tempauth container-quotas
  account-quotas slo dlo versioned_writes proxy-logging proxy-server
Correct pipeline: catch_errors gatekeeper healthcheck proxy-logging
  cache container_sync tempurl ratelimit tempauth bulk container-quotas
  account-quotas slo dlo versioned_writes proxy-logging proxy-server

$ swift-pipeline-auditor etc/object-server.conf-sample --correct

Current pipeline: healthcheck recon object-server

The object-server.conf is correct, so doesn't show any errors or need to
provide a correct pipeline.

well as deployment purposes, e.g. the single-process work proposed in

Currently, object-auditor executes its own tasks for each 'objects-%N'
directory regardless of a policy setting. This means that, for example,
if there are 'objects', 'objects-1' and 'objects-2' directories in the
device and swift.conf contains only [storage-policy:0] and
[storage-policy:1] sections, object-auditor audits all files not only
in 'objects' and 'objects-1' directories but also in 'objects-2' directory.

On the other hand, swift.conf gets preference over real directories for
object-updater. In the above swift.conf setting, object-updater does not
update containers specified by files in 'async_pending-2' dir.

By some operational mistakes or other reasons, policy settings might be
inconsistent among servers of swift cluster. If one background server
has swift.conf file which is inconsistent with the other background
servers, this makes bad impacts to Swift's self-healing features such
as delays of repairing inconsistency among container DBs.

This patch fixes object-updater to notify all object put/delete operations
to container-server following async pending files beneath all
'async_pending*' directories, regardless of policy setting.

Currently TOSCA nodes are mapped to HOT SoftwareConfig resources. For HOT,
SoftwareConfig allows for only one lifecycle per resource so this meant
that there were numerous SoftwareConfig resources (one per lifecycle) for
each TOSCA node. The resultant HOT template becomes hard to distill how
the resources relate to the original TOSCA node definition (both visually
from Horizon, and programmatically from the resource id's).

New to the HOT specification is the SoftwareComponent resource type. This
works very similar to the SoftwareConfig resource, but allows for multiple
lifecycle ""configs"" within the singular SoftwareComponent resource type.
This makes for a straight one-to-one mapping from TOSCA nodes to the
underlying HOT resources.

This patch updates the translator implementation to use these new HOT
SoftwareComponent resource types.

Rings are created and stored just as before, but when the 64K threshold is
reached, the ring will automatically be updated by the builder to use 4 bytes
per device id in order to accommodate the large number of device id slots.

Ring Data Format - no change to version. However, a new field 'device_id_bytes'
is added to json metadata. This change maintains backwards compatibility by
defaulting the device_id_bytes value to 2 if the field is not present in json
metadata. If the field is present, its value (2 or 4) is used for device id
storage.

Ring Data Serialization - for serializing/deserializing 2 bytes per device id
(the default), existing code (prior to this patch) is used. In the case of
storing 4 bytes per device id (more than 65K slots for device ids), instead of
using 'tostring' on the replica2dev_id array to write out the replica device
ids, there is an explicit write of device id packed with struct.pack. This
means that instead of a single loop there are 2 loops (outer for each replica,
and inner for each partition).

Builder - new field 'device_id_bytes' added to track whether 2 or 4 bytes are
being used to store each device id. New rings are created using 2 bytes for
each device id. When a device is added that goes beyond 65K device slots, the
ring will be automatically updated to use 4 bytes per device id.

Refactoring - code to create part2dev_id arrays based on 2 bytes was modified
to call new method in RingData class for creating the part2dev_id array based
on the device_id_bytes values. This refactoring allows existing code to
correctly create the part2dev_id array regardless of the number of device id
slots.

New hash values for rings - since this patch now includes a new field
(device_id_bytes) in the ring data json, the hash of a ring will now be
different. A few unit tests for recon were updated to account for this change.

Backwards Compatibility - maintained. Existing clusters can use these changes
and the ring will be automatically resized when 4 bytes are needed for storing
device id.

Config files - no changes

Log files - no changes

Documentation - no changes (i don't think). Is the upper limit on number of
devices something that should be in documentation?

Ringbuilder CLI usage - no changes. The administration of a swift cluster is
unchanged. All changes in this patch are invisible to the swift user and swift
admin.

Unit Tests - new tests have been added for RingData and RingBuilder. The most
interesting new unit test is 'test_add_beyond_64k_devices'. This test exercises
the builder logic that will update an existing ring to use 4 bytes per device
id instead of the 2 bytes that were used when it was first created.

Forced usage of 4 bytes - not available from CLI. Must be done programmatically
by passing optional parameter on RingBuilder construction.

    This is the account version of patch 212824 and works on the same
    principles.

    Cluster operators need to be able to gather information on Swift
    accounts in the cluster for utilization and auditing purposes,
    only there is no central list of all accounts in the Swift cluster.
    Right now each operator must implement a method to discover accounts
    on their own. This patch enables a way to hook into account auditors
    so they can be iterated over without additional disk IO.

    Like the object audit watcher, this patch makes the auditor locate,
    via entry points, the watchers named in its config file.

    A watcher is a class with at least these four methods:

       __init__(self, conf, logger)
       start(self, audit_type)
       see_target(self, *data)
       end(self)

    The auditor will call watcher.start(audit_type) at the start of an
    audit pass, watcher.see_target(*data) for each account audited, and
    watcher.end() at the end of an audit pass.

    The user-supplied watcher code runs entirely in a child process of the
    auditor process (of which there may be many, if parallel audits are in
    use). This lets the auditor continue working even if the watcher
    crashes or hangs. These subprocesses are automatically killed (after a
    short delay) upon completion of an audit pass.

together with image data. But we need to measure API calls

introduces new methods ""update"" and ""upload"" for both

For Glance v1 wrapper create_image is splitted into create and
upload operations. Upload operation is done by updating
""data"" or ""copy_from"" image properties.

For Glance v2 wrapper create_image is splitted into create and

from Glance v2 client.

Originally, functional tests from TestObjectVersioning and
TestObjectVersioningUTF8 were all failing with 412 errors when
allow_versioned_writes = False in the proxy.conf file. Since the 412 errors
were expected, the solution was to skip the object versioning tests when
allow_versioned_writes = False. Skipping the tests was performed by
including a new block of code in TestObjectVersioningEnv that checked the
status of ResponseError after attempting to create a container using headers.
If the status was 412, the test was skipped. Otherwise, the test failed.

This moves dstat log parsing into a worker thread to lessen the impact
of parsing on the framerate during initial page load. This reduces the
user-facing load impact by roughly 66%, and is particularly helpful
for larger dstat logs.

A small amount of new build infrastructure is also added to generate
individual browserify bundles for each script in `app/workers/`. These
scripts can then be loaded independently of the main bundle while only
including necessary dependencies.

This patch adds support for using local qcow2 and tar based image
for building ubuntu images.

Local qcow2 file is specified by setting DIB_CLOUD_IMAGES to
directory path using file:/// uri and BASE_IMAGE_FILE to file
name of qcow2 file.
Root parition extracted from qcow2 image is cached in
$DIB_IMAGE_CACHE, to speed up build process by avoiding having to
re-extract the root pariton from qcow2 image for each build.
Cached tar extract of qcow2 image is used when $DIB_OFFLINE is set.

Tar based local image can also be used by setting $DIB_OFFLINE and
 by setting DIB_CLOUD_IMAGES to directory path using file:/// uri
and BASE_IMAGE_FILE to file name of tar image.

With this change, to cover both REPL/EC cases, I created a new

I made 2 child classes for REPL and EC which have different
parameters for each tests in the Mixin.

In the new tests, all parametes for assertions are in instance

self.object_meta -> expected metadata in object (file xattr)

This change introduces a new config option 'threads' to the
container sync daemon. With threads > 1 the work of syncing a
certain container is distributed amongst several (green) threads.
We use a green thread pool of size 'threads', where each thread is assigned
a different row from the container db.

Changes in sync.py:
The container_sync method was modified to accommodate multi threading.
With the introduction of multiple threads we have quickly ran into
a bottleneck trying to read row by row from the db, and so an additional
change is to read rows in bulks. For this we introduce iterators over the
db that yield rows to sync.

Changes in test_sync.py:
Tests were updated to test
(1) The modified structure of container_sync (test_phase_2, test_phase_1).
(2) The newly introduced iterators

Changes in doc:
saio container-server config files were updated to have threads > 1.
This allows to test the sync daemon with parallelism while leaving
the 1 default so as not to impact the run time behavior in existing
deployments.

container-server-sample.conf was added with the threads option.

This patch changes recent FileManager construction.

The older one requires single centralized file manager which needs
gateway specific methods (e.g. put_log). However, IMHO, more general
abstraction is suitable to develop the custom file managers as you want
so that this patch reconstruct the FileManager class like as:

StorletFileManager (This class):
    |
    |--- storlet_manager (instance) ------ get_file   (method)
    |                                   |
    |                                   -- write_file (method)
    |
    |--- dependency_manager (instance) --- get_file   (method)
    |                                   |
    |                                   -- write_file (method)
    |
    |--- log_manager (instance) ---------- get_file   (method)
                                        |
                                        -- write_file (method)

Each manager instance only requires 2 methods

- get_file: return a file instance to read from
- write_file: take 2 args, object_name to write to, and file object
              to read content from

On the invocation_flow perspective, this patch refactors the cache
management flow as splitting the routine into storlet apps and
dependency files. And then, this makes each flow to go straight forward
without ""if is_storlet"" branch.

Misc.
- Cleanup tests more!

* Returns a 409 (Conflict) when a user tries to add a duplicate
  property name when updating an image by PATCH (v2) or PUT (v1).
* In the v2 API, returns a 400 (Bad Request) when a user tries
  to create an image with duplicate property names in the request.
* Leaves the v1 API behavior unmodified when a user tries to
  create an image with duplicate property names in the request, as
  (unlike for v2) the current behavior does not cause a 500 (and
  hopefully v1 won't be around too much longer anyway).
  ** using v1 API via python-glanceclient: the first property
     name/value pair is used, the other is ignored; property name is
     created as all-lowercase regardless of how it was specified
  ** using v1 API directly: single all-lowercase property name is
     created, values of the duplicate name/value pairs are
     concatenated together, comma-separated

Glance is case-insensitive when detecting duplicate property names,
but it allows a user to store the name in any case combination.
(This behavior is unchanged.)

In current code files, the exception handle of deleting vnfd
in functional tests like this:

    try:
        self.client.delete_vnfd(vnfd_id)
    except Exception:
        assert False, ""vnfd Delete failed""

This case just judge the failure of deleting vnfd. But if it didn't
delete vnfd, there is no possibility of failure. So this code:

   except Exception:
        assert False, ""vnfd Delete failed""

will be skipped. But actually, most cases we just think about delete
vnfd successfully. This judgment is wrong.
So add a exception handle like this:

    try:
        self.client.delete_vnfd(vnfd_id)
    except Exception:
        assert False, ""vnfd Delete failed""
    try:

    except Exception:

Use show_vnfd(vnfd_id) again, which make sure the success of deleting vnfd.

This is a PoC patch for pxe driver to support boot-from-volume
using iPXE sanboot feature. With this patch and a series of
dependent boot-from-volume patches for ironic&nova&ironicclient,
a iSCSI Cinder volume with CirrOS whole disk image can be used to
boot baremetal servers via iPXE.

This is only for a testing purpose of a series of ironic
boot-from-volume patches. Note that official CirrOS image doesn't
have iscsiadm, so the volume cannot be used after Linux booted.

Before this commit, paths like /v1/white%20space are logged as
/v1/white%2520space by log_request. This can lead to irritations
when analyzing log files and is unnecessary.

The reason lies in the fact, that the quote function is
effectively called twice on the path string, because the
method ""path"" of a request object does already quote it.

This commit ensures that the path gets only quoted once.

On demand data migration allows customers a natural way to migrate
their data from other storage clouds (or file system) into Swift.
This is achieved without being dependent on any special support
from the other clouds.

It's obvious that on demand data migration uses network to transfer
user's data from old storage into Swift, an operation that consumes
certain time and resources. On the other hand, data migration
provides various benefits for the end users. In particular, users
may start easily work with Swift and access their data through Swift
even if their data is stored on some other storage provider. Users
will no longer need to be concerned how to migrate their data into
Swift. In addition on demand data migration provides end users a
continuous access to their data during data migration, since they
don't need to wait till the whole data is migrated. Data migration
layer will access remote cloud only once per single object.

An important aspect of proposed functionality is the need to be
highly versatile for different kind of storage clouds or file
systems, that users may wish to migrate their data from. This commit
includes various access drivers and in addition the suggested
modular architecture allows to easily add more drivers.

Our model assumes that the new cloud (Swift) is the most updated one.
If object was migrated, it will not be migrated again. The same, if
object was migrated and deleted, it will not be migrated again.

In this commit
--------------
1. Data Migration Middleware. (data_migration.py)

a. Validates data migration setup by expecting metadata of container

b. Object migration on demand.

2. Storage Access Drivers (data_migrator_drivers.py)
Contains implementation for access drivers that are used by Data
Migration MW to access remote clouds.

a. Migration from file system ( default implementation )

b. Additional patch will contain migration from storage clouds,
using Apache LibCloud (Optional).
To avoid dependence between Swift and Apache LibCloud, this
implementation is an optional and will only work if LibCloud is
installed in Python. It should be noticed that the benefit of
LibCloud is high, since LibCloud comes prepackaged with drivers
for Amazon S3,Atmos, Microsoft Azure, Google storage,Rackspace
Cloudfiles,Nimbus.

c. Migration from another Swift by using swift-client.( optional)

d. One can easily implement new driver and add it to the
configuration of Data Migration MW.

The general flow of object migration on demand as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Data Migration MW let Swift to handle original request without
any modifications and activates migration logic only if Swift
returned '404 Not Found' as a response for GET / HEAD object
requests.
2. Data Migration MW inspects then local container metadata to
identify whether local container is linked with another cloud.
It then pick up a correct access driver and sends GET object
request to the remote cloud to read an object. Upon receiving
a response from the remote cloud, object is stored locally in
Swift ( without reading an entire object into memory ) and
then it returns a response with object's data to the user.
Each object will be migrated only once, and all subsequent
GET / HEAD requests to the same object will not trigger data
migration anymore.

Current limitations
-------------------
1. Due to code complexity, unified view ( described in blue
print ) is not part of this commit. Will be committed separately.

2. The proposed architecture, keeps read access credentials to
the old cloud, as part of Swift container's system metadata.
All keys related credentials are filtered and are not returned
back to the user. Additional patches may improve the security
of credentials by using encryption.

3. Data migration supports the maximal object size that Swift
can handle in a single request and doesn't yet uses multi part
uploads to handle objects of more than 4GB size.

An example code how to use this feature to migrate data
from file system:

Durable fragment set (which has both .data and .durable) can be
reclaimed (deleted in the worst case) in racing condition.

For example, if all PUTs are in older than reclaime age (i.e. request
X-Timestamp << (now - reclaime_age), e.g. reconstruction PUT)

The following sequence *may* happen in the older code:

===============================================================================
2 nodes have different timestamp object each other with same path
(overwritten), and then,

1. a reconstructor (t0) attempts a PUT and object-server make a
   t0.data file
2: another reconstructor (t1) attempts a PUT and object-server makes a
   t1.data file

likely:
[a reconstructor] -(PUT t0)-> [object-sever] <-(PUT t1)-[another reconstructor]

And then,

3. object-server makes a t0.durable and call cleanup_list_dir which triggers to
   remove t1.data because it doesn't have .durable and older than reclaim age.

4. After that, object-server makes a t1.durable and call cleanup_list_dir will
   remove all .data .durable file older than the newest t1.durable.

5. finally all .data files are gone, unexpectedly.

===============================================================================

This patch prevents such an unexpected racing cleanup. With this code,
object-server at the state 4 (above) will search the newest .durable file
which has at least 1 .data file before cleanup and then keep the durable
frag set as the most recent durable fragment set even if newer durable
(but no .data files) files are found in the device. The orphaned durable
will be reclaimed expecting to be reconstructed again.

Several Neutron scenarios should not take care about creation of network
resources. All this logic should be done by Network context.

Changes in this patch:
- Add ability to setup Network context to create only networks without
  subnets. It is needed for next scenarios:
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_list_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_update_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_delete_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_list_routers
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_update_routers
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_delete_routers
- Deprecate scenario arguments for creation non-related resources(for example:
  networks, subnets). Add Network context to default contexts. Affected
  scenarios:
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_list_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_update_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_delete_subnets
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_list_routers
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_update_routers
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_delete_routers
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_list_ports
   * NeutronNetworks.create_and_update_ports

To apply the fix for a liberasurecode issue [1], we need hard depencency
of liberasurecode requires >=1.3.1. However current binary dependency
maintainance tool ""bindep"" works only for packagers' repository. (i.e. it
reffers the version of apt/yum/etc...) And nothing cared on the binary
built from source.

This patch provides a way to detect incompatible liberasurecode and
reject to use the version when the ec driver instantiated.

NOTE:
- This dependency managemnet depends on erasurecode_version.h header
  file in liberasurecode. i.e. it cannot care of overwritten .so library
  after PyECLib built once.
- This patch may be unnecessary if packagers' repo updated to 1.3.1
  soon. And, IMO, updating packagers' repo immediately is the best wa
  because this patch will cause gate failures which is using
  liberasurecode<1.3.1 installation via bindep in gerrit.

1. Kuryr initialization should not be dependent on neutron availability.
2. Currently neutron client creation attributes can not be used from
config file. Reason is neutron client gets created even before config
file is used while starting kuryr server.

In this fix kuryr neutron client creation is being moved from Kuryr
server initialization to the the following libnetwork api handlers.
These api handlers can be first point of contact where neutron will be
queried. For example, /NetworkDriver.Leave and
/NetworkDriver.DeleteNetwork could be first point of interactions with
neutron in case Kuryr has got restarted and user tries to delete a
container or existing network(created before Kuryr restart)
respectively.

/IpamDriver.RequestPool
/IpamDriver.RequestAddress
/NetworkDriver.DeleteNetwork
/NetworkDriver.DeleteEndpoint

Right now it is possible for cleaning to fail. It will cause an
attempt to tear down cleaning ports, which, if it does not succeed,
will leave cleaning_vif_port_id in port(group)'s internal_info, as
the port might still exist in neutron. If this happens, and the user
decides to disable auto cleaning, he may be stuck with
cleaning_vif_port_id in internal_info forever, unless he modifies the
DB manually. This may cause troubles, as DHCP options will be updated
for the leftover cleaning port instead of tenant port, or, if the
port was in fact deleted, to fail, complaining that the port is not
found.

For pre-existing container databases, upon the first PUT object

We now have two elements for most of our distros which do different
things. The naming for what these different elements do is very unclear
to a user who is not intimately familiar with the elements. Lets rename
our distro elements into *-cloudimage or *-packageinstall and document
the differences. This also allows us to make the -packageinstall
elements provide the packages which -minimal leaves out and which users
generally expect to have (like ssh).

which are capable to boot in UEFI based systems. Currently RHEL 7, CentOS 7,
Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora images have been tested and verified for
x86_64/amd64 architectures.

To build an UEFI capable image,

1. Two Partions were created with GPT partition table. First partition
   contains the EFI System Partition(ESP), while the second partition is
   the root file system. parted is used for creating the partitions.

2. Bootloader element pkg-map has been added with grub-efi which
   installs dependent packages for default and redhat distributions.

3. As part of installing grub boot loader, the ESP partition is mounted
   to /boot/efi directory of the root file system so that grub will
   install required grubx64.efi and other dependent packages in ESP
   partition.

4. Grub configuration files are modified to work with respective
   distributions.

This shows how Rally-as-a-Service can be implemented.

Key ideas:

  * Move oslo_config.cfg.CONF initialization
    from rally.cli.cliutils to rally.api.API.init_config()

  * New class rally.api.API is a base class for all APIs

  * New approach proposes using API instance methods, in
    opposite to static methods. Existing API classes (Task,
    Deployment, Verification) are now used as instances

  * New class rally.aas.service.Service provides single
    endpoint for all Rally API.
    The main benefit of using Service and APIs instances is
    having ability to work with unlimited number of remote Rally
    services as well as with local Rally, within single process.
    This approach also gives flexibility for future
    improvements

How to try this:

 1. Local Service via CLI

    Play with rally/aas/demo_cli without --location argument
    to get data from local Rally Service

 2. Remote Service via CLI

    Launch rally/aas/demo_server in another terminal
    and try rally/aas/demo_cli with additional argument
    --location http://127.0.0.1:8000

 3. Local Service as a Lib

    >>> from rally.aas import service
    >>> svc = service.Service()
    >>> tasks = svc.Task.list()
    >>> deployments = svc.Deployment.list()

 4. Remote Service as a Lib (demo server must be running)

    >>> from rally.aas import service
    >>> svc = service.Service(""http://127.0.0.1:8000"")
    >>> tasks = svc.Task.list()
    >>> deployments = svc.Deployment.list()

 5. Using Rally API explicitly

   * Legacy usage (does not support location):

     >>> from rally import api
     >>> api.API.init_config()  # set up DB connection, once
     >>> tasks = api.Task.list()
     >>> deployments = api.Deployment.list()

   * With API instancemethods, for local Rally:

     >>> from rally import api
     >>> api.API.init_config()  # set up DB connection, once
     >>> tasks = api._Task().list()
     >>> deployments = api._Deployment().list()

   * With API instancemethods, for remote Rally
     (demo server must be running):

     >>> from rally import api
     >>> api.API.init_config()  # set up DB connection, once
     >>> location = ""http://127.0.0.1:8000""
     >>> tasks = api.Task(location).list()
     >>> deployments = api.Deployment(location).list()

  6. Finally, lets make a fun and use Rally Service
     as proxy to another Rally Service:

   run demo server (port 8000 by default) and another demo server
   on port 8001 and location pointed to first service:

        $ ./rally/aas/demo_server
        $ ./rally/aas/demo_server 8001 http://127.0.0.1:8000

   now we can query service http://127.0.0.1:8000 via proxy service:

        $ ./rally/aas/demo_cli <command args> --location http://127.0.0.1:8001

It came to my attention that some old rings may be moving parts ""too""
aggressively when faced against the new rebalance algorithm.

It's not so much that the balance or dispersion is getting *bad* - but
more so it's FIXING ALL THE THINGS in one go - even though no weights
are being changed.

To control the movement of parts the new pretend_min_part_hours_locked
command will reset all the last_part_moves so that it *feels* like the
ring can't rebalance *anything* even though it would really like to.

In order to allow only a *subset* of parts to come out of the lock at
a time (so the operator can control how many parts move) the
pretend_min_part_hours_passed command now accepts an optional ratio
argument which can be less than 100% - it will choose the least
recently moved parts and make them movable.

This is an evolution of a previous idea to allow operators to control
the number of parts moved per rebalance - but adapted with an eye
towards respecting essential un-avoidable part movement.  Since
min_part_hours is already ignored for failed devices (and other
essential part assignment like duplicate-part/multiple-replica to
device or replica count adjustment) limiting part movement with
pretend_min_part_hours_[locked|passed] will safely allow devices to be
failed and removed from the ring using normal swift-ring-builder
commands.

I found it sort of interesting to play around with on the command line
to functionally observe the effect of min_part_hours - so it might be
useful as a general tool in dev.

As always using pretend_min_part_hours on production rings carries
some risk.  You need to closely monitor your rebalance cycle as you
are circumventing some safety measures in the rings partition
placement algorithm.  But if you move slowly and carefully you might
be able to pull one out of the fire!

the Resource can update own etag, got from Manager.
When doing update request, the user can go with etag

There are two ways to configure trunk port:

 * C1: When segmentation details for trunk ports are inherited from

   Added implementation for cisco, arista, OVS on Linux.

 * C2: When user set segmentation details for trunk port explicitly.
   Switch should support VLAN translation for this case.

NetmikoSwitch.plug_port_to_network() is deprecated. New bind_port()
should be used instead.

New switch config option: vlan_translation_supported was introduced.

allow user names to change but not the user id. Basing our ACL on

combination of project and user ids.
