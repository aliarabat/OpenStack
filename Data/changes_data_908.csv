Add new BondType and BridgeType parameters to the bond-with-vlans network
configs.  These options can be set to ovs_bond/linux_bond  and
ovs_bridge/linux_bridge (respectively) to switch between using OVS or linux
bridge for bonds.

NOTE: need to also consider how to handle the BondInterfaceOvsOptions
parameter (should we add another parameter for specific Linux bridge
options too?). Even so os-net-config should ignore ovs_options for
linux bonds functionally this should be fine.

With the removement of threads_per_disk there is no longer a need to use
run_in_thread() at all; it was just calling the function itself when
running with 0 threads.
Similar to force_run_in_thread() - with 0 threads it was basically doing
the same like in tpool_reraise(), therefore replacing the call and
finally removing the complete ThreadPool class.

Note that this might break external consumers that are inheriting
BaseDiskFileManager; in this case you need to adopt this change in your
codebase then.

This patch removes the threads_per_disk setting. It was already a deprecated

Pull ICMPV6_ALLOWED_TYPES back into Neutron constants from neutron-lib,
This constant defines the ICMPv6 types which are allowed to ingress
through security groups before user rules are implemented. As such this
constant represents default policy more so than other constants.

Remove multicast listener discovery (MLD) report and done messages for
list of allowed message types, as these messages are sent by an end
station and received by a multicast router and/or underlying network
switch.  Should a user need to operate a multicast router on an
instance, they should explicitly allow these messages. Multicast
listener discovery query messages are permitted, since and instance
receiving these should reply with an MLD report indicating which
multicast groups it is participating in.

Permit router advertisements so instances can discover IPv6 routers
without sending router solicitation messages.

This adds a semaphore scoped to the network ID of a port
creation in ML2 to ensure that all workers on a single server
only try to allocate an IP for that network one at a time.

This will alleviate the deadlock error retry mechanism being
exceeded due to the related bug. It reduces the number of contenders
for a single IP allocation from number of workers to number of servers.

It will unblock the switch to pluggable ipam while the IP allocation
strategy is being revamped to be less racey.

When we only have the connector for the wrong host,
add instance host to the connector for evacuation.

When calling terminate_connection for evacuate, the
connector should be for the original host and not
the new host. Patch [1] provides a fix by using
the connector from init_connection which is stashed
in bdm.connection_info, but that approach cannot fix
this bug for volumes that were attached before that
patch.

To allow a fix for existing attachments, add the
instance host in connector['instance_host']. This
will allow cinder drivers to be patched to check
for this defect and use the instance host and volume
to provide a workaround (the rest of the bogus
current host connector is left as-is to avoid creating
new defects such as validation or type errors).

For example:

* Using host and volume a cinder driver may be able
to discover the initiator or wwpns that are needed, or

* Using the instance host instead of the connector host,
some drivers may not need the other parts of the connnector, or

* Detecting the mismatch would allow some drivers to
raise an exception instead of just trying to disconnect
the wrong host connection which might succeed or fail or
leave dangling connections.

The action registry threw an error when OS::Nova::Hypervisor [0]
wasn't found. This may get fixed in horizon, but we should
do a little protective coding here so that the UI handles
this without completely barfing.

There may need to be follow up patches to more gracefully handle
other registry usages.

Add decorations where required.

There are roughly a dozen classes in Neutron that define abstract
methods or properties but are not decorated with
@six.add_metaclass(abc.ABCMeta). Without this decoration, children
can be created without defining the required methods or properties.

Decorating RBACColumns in db/rbac_db_models.py causes failures and will
be reported separately.

Decorating unit tests is of dubious benifit and should be addressed
separately (if at all).

There are also several more places where metaclassing isn't correct, to
be taken care of in follow-on patches.

For example, BaseScheduler is using the fact the None doesn't have a
filter_agents() method, which gives developers confusing error messages
when they incorrectly implement the interface, and they won't see any
error until schedule() is called. As an aside, the docstring for this
base class is also incorrect.

This reverts commit 271a2587a38c6a396213c95aaa8a690fcc283091.

This patch seems to have caused the TripleO upgrades job to fail
in that running Nova instances stopped working after an upgrade.

Could be there is a missing relationship or something in Puppet or
perhaps something else keystone related but updating to this
as a default seems it could break things.

In Puppet OpenStack CI, we use r10k to clone Puppet OpenStack modules
and all their dependencies from different places.
The Puppetfile is useful for both unit and functional tests, so we have
a consistency in what we test.

Until now, we were managing this Puppetfile without automation.
From time to time, we were updating the file but it does not scale,
regarding the work that needs to be done and the amount of dependencies
that never stop to grow up.

We recently implemented a script that is called
generate_puppetfile.sh (see dependency). This script aims to generate a
Puppetfile by cloning OpenStack & External modules.
The script will fetch tags and take the most recent one.
The script works as it is now, please look:
https://review.openstack.org/300696
And the Puppetfile that is generated.

This patch is an attempt to automate the run of this script, by using
the periodic job that is already in place for many other projects.

More features will come in next iterations:
* support stable branches
* add more logic in the script to detect whether or not tags exist (all
  our current modules have tags, but we never know...)

DO NOT MERGE

- This change introduces a  new preallocated
  file descriptor based memory backing for
  qemu guest.
- This change enabled vhost-user to be used
  without hugepages.
- This patchset is a poc to demonstrate the
  ablity to use vhost-user with ovs-dpdk
  and non hugepages backed guest
- This patchset uses the <qemu:commandline>
  xml element to correctly create the memory
  backing as libvirt does not support
  it directly.

Questions:
- Is it ok to use <qemu:commandline> in nova?
- could the  <qemu:commandline> approch be used
  initally and at a later date swap to a native
  xml element if support was added to libvirt?
- Should the file discripter backed memory be
  used as a default or should it be requested
  as a memory backing as hugepages is today?
  e.g. hw:mem_page_size=FD or hw:mem_page_size=FD4K

Ill be at the summit if anyone wants to discuss.

A recent patch exposed valid_values via property, and cocerced the
result to a tuple to convey the immutable nature of them. This was
a good thought, but unfortunately breaks __repr__ stability, which
we use in the fixture to calculate the object hashes.

We could make the __repr__ dig into the raw types on the field
instead of using the property, but this is probably not the best and
smallest change at this point. If we can get everyone to start using
tuples for their value_values list, then we could land a change to
coerce and enforce that. Right now, we just need to fix the
unexpected regression.

is significantly slower in running the unittests, and *way*
slower in doing the dangling-mock detection. Setting the
recursion value to '1' will make the tests run faster while

This test is validating internal behavior of the oslo.policy
library. Since oslo.policy already has tests for this
function, we don't have to test it in keystone.

As of commit 83d209e in oslo.policy the test fails because
oslo.policy has been enhanced to support YAML and the test is
using valid YAML.

An alternative is to change the test to have a file that's
invalid YAML (remove the ']'), but then it might break again.

An alternative is to change the test to mock out the behavior,
but then the test would just be showing that if we mock out
rules.enforce to raise ValueError it does that.

We hoped that checking /sys/class/net/XXX/carrier will allow us
to not wait for interfaces that are not connected at all.
In reality this field turned out to be unreliable. For example, it is
also set to 0 when interface is down or is being configured.
The bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1327255 shows
the case when carrier is 0 for all interfaces, including one that is
used to post back data, which is obvious non-sense.

This change removes check on carrier for the loop. To avoid 60 seconds
wait for people with several NIC's, it's changed to only wait for the
PXE booting NIC, which obviously must get an IP address.

This makes IP addresses in the inspection data for other NIC's somewhat
unreliable. A new option inspection_dhcp_all_interfaces is introduced
to allow waiting for all NIC's to get IP addresses.

This change should finally fix bug 1564954.

The NetApp cDOT drivers keep their pool capacities in the
data structures used for other pool attributes that support
various volume type extra specs.  But the capacity info is
fast-changing, while the other pool attributes rarely or never
change.  A subsequent patch will simplify the pool attribute
collection code by refreshing itself on a slow cadence using
loopingcall.  This patch splits the pool capacity collection
so that it may be called independently on each call to
_update_volume_stats.

The mac-spoofing filtering done by iptables was
not adequate. See the bug report and change
I39dc0e23fc118ede19ef2d986b29fc5a8e48ff78 for
more information.

This patch adds flows to the OVS agent to block
any traffic from the VM that isn't in the allowed
address pairs macs or the mac address field of
the port.

Conflicts:
    This had to be heavily modified to work with Kilo due to
    the lack of a pluggable openflow interface that was present
    in master, mitaka, and liberty.

Symptom: Canceling a wizard action, then clicking on it again failed to
open the action.

Reason: The Angular wizard did not have a way to communicate back to the
calling context that the window had been canceled.  Following this back,
that meant that the actions directive could not re-enable the button.

Solution: Add a callback, same as the 'submit' configuration, ensuring
that the context can register a callback to be called when the user cancels
the modal action.  Also ensure that ESC closes of the modal are caught
and handled as a cancel.

Testing: Before this fix, verify that going to the Angular Images panel,
if you select Edit Image for an item, then cancel it, then re-select the
Edit Image, you cannot execute the action.  After the fix, verify that
after canceling the action, you can again run it.

By default, devstack creates it's own test flavors for Tempest runs.

These are not in the cells API database since they are non-default
for nova so any resize tests in Tempest with cells and these custom
flavors fail.

Configure Tempest to not run resize tests if using cells and custom
flavors.

This allows us to also clean up a bunch of the resize skips found
in nova/devstack/tempest-dsvm-cells-rc.

If user executes ""glance image-list"" then default sort direction
is asc. That behavior has been implemented in client.
If user executes ""glance image-list --sort-key name then default
sort direction is desc because client doesn't this by default
and uses default server behavior (which is desc).
It confuses users who expect the list of images to be printed
in the same ordering as glance image-list.
So it seems reasonable to change default server sort direction
for images in order to provide a consistency between client
and server.

In order to prevent race conditions with nodes joining the cluster
simultaneously when the cluster is first formed, we move the rabbitmq
installation play to be 'serial: 1'. However, when the nodes are being
upgraded, it cannot be done in serial so in this case we set 'serial: 0'

There are some tasks/roles called in this playbook that can still be
run in parallel, so we split out the rabbitmq-server install into a
separate play so that we only serialise the parts that are necessary
to ensure maximum efficiency.

If a network has IPv4 and IPv6(prefix delegated) subnets,
prefix delegation is deleting port's IPv4 address and
not properly updating IPv6 address.

Prefix Delegation(PD) is calling port_update with empty fixed_ip,
for the port with IPv4 and IPv6(PD) subnets. After fixing this,
when _update_ips_for_port is called with new_ips having IPv6 PD subnet,
it is unable to add IPv6 address with new subnet prefix,
as _test_fixed_ips_for_port not returning IPv6 PD subnet.

To fix this, we explicitly add PD subnet to ""to_add"" list,
so that IPv6 address with new prefix added to PD subnet's port.

The warnerrors boolean option is used to tell Sphinx builders to
treat warnings as errors which will cause sphinx-build to fail if
it encounters warnings. This is generally useful to ensure your
documentation stays clean once you have a good docs build.

since we are python 2 and 3 compatible we should create a
universal wheel distribution.

In order to prevent race conditions with nodes joining the cluster
simultaneously when the cluster is first formed, we move the rabbitmq
installation play to be 'serial: 1'. However, when the nodes are being
upgraded, it cannot be done in serial so in this case we set 'serial: 0'

The tests are removed from a post_task include in the install play, and
moved to their own play as they need to be run after the entire cluster
has been formed. As well as moving a few generic vars into the
test-vars.yml include, we also pass in the specific version of rabbitmq
to be tested against in the test play.

In Docker 1.11 support for the two newly added
libnetwork methods is not required. However, not
having these supported result in errors that may
be confusing to users.

These two methods are to make support for exported
and published ports on a per container basis as discussed
here: https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/issues/992
It is proposed that by Docker version 1.12 support
for these methods become mandatory.

Support for exposed port will be added in a separate patchset.
Support for publishing port may be added later on when
needed support in Neutron is available.

tell whether to perform package update, and also to tell whether the
top-level stack is being created or updated (which was incorrect and
resulted in bug 1567384, and an attempt to work around that bug resulted
in bug 1567385).

We cannot use Heat's ""action"" conditionals in some cases, because they
refer to the direct parent stack, which can yield undesirable results
when introducing new nested stacks or temporarily no-opping something
and then adding it back (in both these cases, ""action"" would be
considered ""CREATE"", even though the top-level stack is in ""UPDATE"").

new things are:

* clear workflow and status definition
* scope of the (upcoming) nova bugs meeting

In order to prevent race conditions with nodes joining the cluster
simultaneously when the cluster is first formed, we move the rabbitmq
installation play to be 'serial: 1'. However, when the nodes are being
upgraded, it cannot be done in serial so in this case we set 'serial: 0'

There are some tasks/roles called in this playbook that can still be
run in parallel, so we split out the rabbitmq-server install into a
separate play so that we only serialise the parts that are necessary
to ensure maximum efficiency.

This patch improves the rest_parameters parsing so that the 'optional'
property can be specified from within the RST file instead of uniformly
from the parameters.yaml file. The reason is that most parameters can be
optional in one place but be mandatory in other places. We should
specify whether a parameter is optional from where it is referenced,
rather than where it is defined (i.e. the yaml file).

Libvirt will use AppArmor for security in some distributions such as
ubuntu. AppArmor profile is manipulated by virt-aa-helper. If user want
to boot in uefi, they need to specify uefi loader path. But currently
nova will only access to /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd. However libvirt
forbid access to /usr/share before libvirt 1.2.19. Default package for
older os release such as ubuntu trusty didn't fix yet.

This patch add one uefi option for uefi loader path instead of static
code.

This is an internal-only fix, as it does not change any external APIs. A
bit of obfuscation was occurring in the
'template_utils.process_template_path' function call. First we try to
retrieve the template from a urllib call. If that fails, then we try to
make a request with the custom request_object function. If the
request_object function failed to retrieve the template as well, it
would report back 'ERROR: None'. I left both of the calls in this
function, but I made the first exception bubble up back to the caller,
since it is more helpful to the user.

The new error message should report back the following when a template
cannot be found:

<urlopen error [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'/root/python-heatclient/test.yaml'>

The current mac-spoofing code in iptables has two issues.
First, it occurs after the address discovery allow rules
(e.g. DHCP), so MAC addresses can be spoofed on discovery
protocols. Second, since it is based on iptables, it
doesn't apply to protocols like STP.

This means a VM could generate one of these types of packets
with a spoofed MAC address to trick switches into learning
that the spoofed MAC now belongs to the VM's port. The impact
of this depends on the configuration of the environment
(e.g. use of L2pop: see the bug report for details).

This patch adds MAC spoofing filtering to the ARP protection
code for Linux bridge based on ebtables. Only traffic sourced
from the MAC address on the port or in the allowed address
pair MACs will be allowed.

This filtering will not be enabled if the port has port
security disabled or if the device_owner starts with 'network:'.

The initial experimental implementation of Keystone V3 - which makes use of domain
scoped projects, users and roles - allowed for a domain not to be specified.

In order to offer backward compatibility as much as possible, a resource name
without a domain was assumed to belong to either the default domain or if the name
was unique among all domains then the domain in question to be used.

Although a noble idea, it turned out this behavior is creating more confusion
than needed. On top of that, the default domain 'Default' for keystone can be
changed.

The recommendation would be to always use a domain name when applied to domain
scoped object and rely or assume on some default or convention.

This can be done into stages:
1. Remove the feature assuming the domain when the resource is unique
2. Deprecate not using a domain name on the long run.

Elasticsearch requires all field types in an index to be consistent
(and it's better for searching, too). ES-2.x actually enforces this
and won't allow mappings to be created. This patch fixes a couple of
fields and adds a unit test to check all plugins in the source tree.

Note that this does change the structure of the 'security_group' field
for nova servers to be a flat string (or array of strings). The other
option would be to rename the field on ports, or make it a nested type
on Ports also. There is a post-search filtering step that attempts to
return results as compatible with the APIs as possible, at least for
the meantime until we have a larger discussion about this problem.

Currently, the home page has a hard-coded summary panel specifically
for displaying overviews of subunit artifacts, which makes it
impossible to show information on other types of artifacts. This adds
a new 'summaryService' and associated 'artifact-summary' directive
that can dynamically create summary panels depending on artifact type.

Additionally, since the summary service allows many summary panels per
type per named artifact, we can have multiple (priority-ordered)
panels for each artifact. As an example of this, the existing subunit
summary has been split into simpler 'subunit-summary' and
'subunit-errors' panels.

On first deployment bootstrap-ansible.sh pulls its packages from PyPI.
On upgrade, when the deployment host is shared with a controller, a
pip.conf file exists to restrict pip to the packages hosted by the repo
containers. This causes bootstrap-ansible.sh to fail when the repo
server created by the previous version does not contain a compatible
version.

This commit adds the flag '--isolated' to allow the bootstrap process to
bypass the repo server.

To allow the pip command to fall back on using the isolated flag the
code is refactored to determine the version of pip prior to its use.

I'm not sure how that happened. This change brings the

This fixes a defect where a locally cached image is not
always used by the Copy Offload feature. By using an available
image, local to the same backend as the share, performance can be
improved as a clone operation is executed instead of a remote copy.

Also, moved and refactored tests from test_netapp_nfs.py to the
correct test class under the netapp driver test directory. This is
part of the ongoing refactoring of test_netapp_nfs.py to meet

Add a deliverable and an initial release (we've never yet tagged one)
for puppet-tripleo.

Note this is going under _independent for now, but we intend on doing
coordinated releases for all tripleo components for each milestone
during the newton cycle ref https://review.openstack.org/#/c/308236/
this is just an initial release that's required for downstream packages
to consume, future releases will be actual newton deliverables.

The hash chosen is based on the most recent current-tripleo delorean,
which is based on our most recent periodic CI job promotion.
