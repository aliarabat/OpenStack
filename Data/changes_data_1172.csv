ovs can create device if the port has type=internal. Currently,
we use `ovs-vsctl -- del-port foo -- add-port foo -- set Interface
foo type=internal` to (re-)create an ovs managed device. And then
`ip` is used to set mac address, mtu, namespace for the device.

Current usage of `ip` commands requires the created device to not
belong to any namespace. This cannot be guaranteed if the device
is already in a wrong or deleted namespace before the `ovs-vsctl`
command. `ovs-vsctl` can delete devices managed by ovs even if the
device is in a deleted namespace but it will ignore the delete
operation if `del-port`, `add-port`, `set ... type=internal` are
put together, in one command transaction.

This patch moves out the del-port part from the long `ovs-vsctl`
command, making del-port a single command transaction. Therefore,
ovs will not ignore the delete operation and the new device
created won't belong to any namespace and following `ip` commands
won't complain about ""device not found"".

Create one vm and then detach the port of this vm immediately
may cause the port in BUILD status forever.

Be notice that the bug is hard to reproduce because it depends
on the indeed handling sequence.

We must review the port create/attach/detach sequence to solve
the problem.

In the sequences descripted bellow,the bug happens:

1, create one vm,so nova-compute notifies neutron using the
""create_port"" api, and nova-compute create one port in ovs.
2, neutron-server creates the related detail information in
the db.
3.1, neutron-openvswitch-agent awares the creation of the port
by loop function and starts to handle the ""port_add"" event.
It gets the details of the port from neutron-server correctly
in the ""treat_devices_added_or_updated"" function,
but the function ""get_vif_port_by_id"" has not been called.
4, at this time,detach the interface of the vm and nova-compute
will delete the port from the ovs
3.2 then ""get_vif_port_by_id"" continues, it finds the vif not
exists and skips update_device_down/update_device_up rpc handling

5, then the port will be left in BUILD and will can not be
operated by end-users forever.

In 3.2 if the port not exists, call update_device_down to notify
the neutron-server set the port status to DOWN. This makes the
port can be attached to vm again.And even the port is attached
to one vm again in no time after detached, the neutron-ovs-agent
can handle the port-add event in next loop cycle,so it is safe
enough.

This patch eliminates the effectively nop operations of update_router and
delete_router of L3RouterApplianceDBMixin.

When update_router, o_r aren't used later, so
_add_type_and_hosting_device_info(o_r) is effectively nop.
When delete_router, the result of _add_type_and_hosting_device_info()
is used as router['hosting_info']. which equals to r_hd_binding.hosting_device.
unschedule_router_from_hosting_device method itself checks if
hosting_device is None, so the caller doesn't need to check it explicitly.

In the bulk version of the port create request, multiple port creations
may be requested. If there is a port without specifying an fixed_ip
address, one is assigned to it. If a later port requests the same
address, a conflict is detected and raised.

Now 'create_port_bulk' will order the ports in the request, so that,
fixed_ip configured ports will be created first and
other ports will get remaining un allocated ip addresses.
In this way we can avoid the conflict address for two ports.

When associating a floating IP with an internal address we look for a
router that is connected to the external network (from which the
floating IP is allocated) and to the internal network on which the
internal address is found.

The current code considers only internal networks that are directly
connected to the router. It does not take into account routes that are
configured on the router via the extraroute extension, that is, it does
not allow associating a floating IP with networks that are reachable by
hopping over devices that connect networks.

Given an internal address with which we would like to associate a
floating IP, the fix also considers routers with extra routes where
all of the following conditions are met:
- The router belongs to the same tenant as the port of the internal
  address.
- The internal address matches one of the router routes.
- The router is attached to the floating IP external network.
- The internal address network is (possibly indirectly) connected to
  the router.

The router with the most specific route will be used.

When _try_generate_ip is executed, a lock is obtained on an inner join select
statement over ipavailabilityranges and ipallocationpools tables. If there
are no available ranges any more a _rebuild_availability_ranges is executed
in order to rebuild the available ranges from the currently allocated ips.
_rebuild_availability_ranges will read the current ipallocations and insert
new records in the ipavailabilityranges table. If there are multiple threads
executing this code (_try_generate_ip and _rebuild_availability_ranges) at the
same time, the lock obtained during _try_generate_ip should prevent
them of calling _rebuild_availability_ranges simultaneously. After the first
thread finishes updating the available ranges it will release the lock and the
second thread will be able to get a new available IP.

In DB2 and PostgreSQL there is an issue with the initial select and the lock is
not obtained in the case when there are no ipavailabilityranges for the current
subnet. This is happening because the returned join statement will not generate
any return rows and the DB will not create a lock at all. This leads to
concurrent _rebuild_availability_ranges executed. _rebuild_availability_ranges
will obtain a lock over ipallocations and this will prevent the two threads of
trying to generate same result but when the first thread finishes it will
release this lock and the second thread will continue to rebuild the ranges
which will lead to a duplicate entry or in some cases to multiple overlapping
entries in the ip available ranges table. The second situation could be a
bigger issue because it will not show any signs of a problem at the time (no
exceptions from the database) but later after continuing allocating IPs the
two records will reach same value for the first_ip which will lead to
_try_generate_ip not able to generate any IPs any more and port_create will
stop working for this subnet.

The fix proposed here is to split the initial join into two separate join
statements. First lock on ipallocationpools and after that try to lock on
ipavailabilityranges. This situation should work as there should be always
records for ipallocationpools and the lock will always work in this part
of the code.

This patch removes the logic for creating chained local switches in
the NSX backend for Neutron networks with flat or vlan bindings.
Switch chaining as a feature is no more useful since the underlying
backend limitation has been long removed.

The logic for reading chained logical switches is however
preserved by this patch, since some older neutron networks could
still be mapped to chained logical switches.

Allow network id of port to be updated.
When instance vm is used as neutron l3 router,
add/remove-router-interface API is intuitively mapped to nova
interface-attach/detach. which triggers vnic hot-plug/unplug.
However guest OS doesn't always support hot-plug/unplug. In order to
support such OS as routervm, allow such VM to boot with vnics
attached, but those ports aren't connected to any tenant networks.
Later when add/remove-router-interface is issued, plug/unplug those
ports to tenant network.

Neutron supports a set of DNSes, Gateway, CIDR, IP Version, and some other key
elements. One key element that is missing is the domain name.

Currently, the domain name gets set by the DHCP server and is set across the
entire cloud (typically set the by dhcp_agent.ini attribute dhcp_domain).
Clouds will typically support many domains, perhaps separated physical
networks, subdividing existing domains, or many other reasons.

By providing this attribute as part of the Network object in Neutron, clients
gain the flexibility to further subdivide their network and gain greater
control of their infrastructure.

We propose to extend Neutron's DHCP agent code so that it works when
data to/from VMs is being routed by the immediate compute host instead
of being bridged. The routed approach enables various alternative
approaches to providing connectivity between VMs - particularly in
deployments where those VMs only require services at layer 3 (IP) and
above - and it is still possible to implement, through iptables and
route distribution filters, all of the detailed connectivity and
security policies that are implied by any given set of OpenStack's
networking, security group and router configurations.

to how we intend Neutron LBaaS to interact with Barbican, as well
as how the reference implementation of LBaaS will work with v2. This

This spec offers and  alternative to the current OpenStack implementation
of DHCP utilizing dnsmasq(http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html),
this spec is proposing an alternative. Others have proposed alternatives
generally drivin from their desire to support their customers in Openstack
implementation. Rather than these customers having to support muliple
versions of DHCP within their environments, the support of alternative
DHCP choices seem the most plausible. The current apporach is using a
dnsmasq server managing each subnet, whereas alternative approachs
utilize a centralized server with the use of relays to forward DHCP
requests to/from that server. We propose that an additional DHCP
driver be provided such that operators can options as to operational
DHCP, such as Cisco’s DHCP product: Cisco Prime Network Registrar (CPNR).

The project/tenant is only stored with the user when using
the sql (default) backend.  This means calls like user list
and user show will not show the default project.  For getting
the project/tenant, if it is not present in the instances
information provided by user list --long, we don't actually
get the project/tenant, we just check to see if the user is
assigned to the given tenant/project.  For setting the
project/tenant, this is usually done with user create, but when
ldap is read-only, we have to use role add to add the user to a
default _member_ role and at the same time assign the user to a
given project/tenant.  This also adds support for using the
openstack $obj show commands which return --format shell output,
and return a hash of key/value pairs.

swift-object-replicator lets you specify --devices and --partitions to
perform a single replication pass over just those devices and
partitions. However, it still scans every device and every partition
to build up a list of jobs to do, then throws away the jobs for the
wrong devices and partitions. This isn't too bad with partitions since
it only wastes some CPU, but with devices, it results in unnecessary
disk IO.

This commit pushes the device and partition filtering a little further
down into collect_jobs to avoid wasted work.

This is driven by a few things. Firstly we currently cannot run
our tests except by installing oslo.db after each edit, which impedes
developers by making things slow, and confusing (forget to install,
and you test the last installed code).

Secondly, we cannot use unittest discovery as we do throughout the
rest of OpenStack because it detects that the wrong module is
loaded (that is, the installed one, not the local one) and throws
an error.

Thirdly, we can't rearrange the source tree to be in compliance with
the standard layout for OpenStack (project/tests/...) which means
our test ids are not namespaced today, and so we can't tell what
project a given test result is from without trying to map actual
test functions - which is much harder.

Fourth, due to pip issue #3, we cannot pip install -e packages that
are namespaced using the pkg_resources namespace implementation.

The PEP-420 implementation uses a blank namespace directory with no
__init__.py. However that requires a minimum python version greater
than our supported minimum of 2.6/2.7. importlib2 could help but isn't
ready yet (and we'd still need some magic on installed systems to
activate it). An alternative, which this implementation has chosen, is
to install using the PEP-420 layout (no __init__ in the namespace
package), but simultaneously depend on a package to provide a
__init__.py (the olso package). When we can hard depend on PEP-420 we
can delete that common package. To let developers work locally we need
the local namespace directory to be on the path, so it needs an
__init__.py, and we also need the site-packages namespace directory to
be on the path, so we put a thunk to do that into the local
__init__.py and filter that __init__.py out from installation using
MANIFEST.in.

There is one minor functional difference in this patch.  Previously,
init_firewall() was called conditionaly.  Now it is always called.  However,
it's harmless to always call it, as it's just some initialization code.

The owners of maven.research.rackspacecloud.com/ seem to have introduced
a 301 redirect permanent from http -> https URLs on around Jan 10th.
This has broken the master/trove check builds since that time.

Maven, when running in the infrastructure CI environment, fails to
follow these redirects.

This code change simply refers to the maven software repositories using
https URLs.

Local testing of this change against Tesora's downstream CI found that
it may be necessary to purge the broken/cached file from the bare-trusty
CI build machines ala:
rm /home/jenkins/.m2/repository/com/rackspace/cloud/api/wadl-tools/1.0.9
(continued..) /wadl-tools-1.0.9.jar

The owners of maven.research.rackspacecloud.com/ seem to have introduced
a 301 redirect permanent from http -> https URLs on around Jan 10th.
This has broken the master/trove check builds since that time.

Maven, when running in the infrastructure CI environment, fails to
follow these redirects.

This code change simply refers to the maven software repositories using
https URLs.

Local testing of this change against Tesora's downstream CI found that
it may be necessary to purge the broken/cached file from the bare-trusty
CI build machines ala:
rm /home/jenkins/.m2/repository/com/rackspace/cloud/api/wadl-tools/1.0.9

In Icehouse with ""iscsi_use_multipath=true"", attaching a multipath
iSCSI volume may create unnecessary iSCSI sessions.

The iscsiadm discovery command in connect_volume() returns all of the
targets in the Cinder node, not just the ones related to the multipath
volume which is specified by iqn. If the storage has many targets,
connecting to all these volumes will also result in many unnecessary
connections.

There are two types of iSCSI multipath devices. One which shares
the same iqn between multiple portals, and the other which use
different iqns on different portals. connect_volume() needs to
identify the type by checking iscsiadm the output if the iqn is
used by multiple portals.

This patch changes the behavior of attaching volume:

   1. Identify the type by checking the iscsiadm output.
   2. Connect to the correct targets by connect_to_iscsi_portal().

Some users (TripleO specifically) want to disable features via a
count of zero, which is a problem as we always recurse and validate
the nested stack since c31c34f8dfd0919bf46a975701c139073115debc

Instead, we only do validation when the count is non-zero, to
enable, e.g default image names, to be ignored at validation
time (as we'll never use them) instead of rejected by the nested
schema (e.g the server.py properties schema which contains a
custom contraint to always validate the image).

This should still allow us to fail fast (at validation time before
creating anything) when we're actually about to create something,
e.g when the count is non-zero.

This patch also rolls in the fix for the regression this originally
caused on master, Iea454f4201990f65633b644bbefe708e5a216885.

Currently object deletion synchronizing was done via a DELETE request
in SimpleClient. If the container was using a non_zero storage policy,
object-server would not find the objects to be deleted since the storage
policy index value in the request header was set to 0 defaultly. This
results the remote objects still exits after synchronizing done.

This patch sets the correct header of the DELETE request with right
storage policy index, so the remote object-server would delete the
objects.

While adding security group rule Nova can obtain BadRequest exception from
neutronclient. Add handling this exception and raise nova exception
instead of reraising neutron exception.

This helps to process correctly error code, so now Nova raises BadRequest
from Neutron with code 400 instead of 500 as it was before.

Some changes in original commit is required because tests is moved in kilo,
and some changes in fake API is done. So revert all this changes only in new
testcase

Submitted a retry decorator and it was pointed out that
the retrying library was already in global-requirements,
it would probably be good to leverage this and use it rather
than roll our own, so let's add it to our version of requirements
and then we can look at whether using a decorator or just
leveraging the lib is the right way to go.

The Object class has two properties which confuse attribute setting when
receiving body values which directly correspond to the *name* of the
attribute on the class, but not to the expected *prop*. Receiving
""last_modified"" in the body causes both ""last_modified"" and it's
expected prop name, ""last-modified"", to be set, thus changing the size
of the attrs dictionary inside of Resource.__init__.

This change also slightly modifies test_head, which was operating in a
slightly odd way in the first place, but turned into a failing test
because it wasn't passing through the proper channels to set its
attributes because we were side-stepping it..

strongSwan doesn't support namespace natively, this wrapper
will use ""mount --bind"" to simulate the ns like this:

sudo neutron-rootwrap /etc/neutron/rootwrap.conf ip netns \
exec <namespace-id> neutron-netns-wrapper --mount_paths \
=/etc:/var/lib/neutron/vpnaas/<xxxx-id>/etc, \
/var/run:/var/lib/neutron/vpnaas/<xxxx-id>/var/run \
--cmd=ipsec,status

Both sudoers and rootwrap.conf will not exist in the
directory /etc after bind-mount, thus we can't use
utils.execute(cmd, conf.root_helper) in
neutron/agent/linux/utils.py. so implement a function
execte(cmd) in this wrapper as an alternative. then we can
use root_helper to invoke this wrapper to make sure all
commands are still running as root as below code shows.
Finally, also need to check in wrapper if cmd matches
CommandFilter based on the same reason.
ip_wrapper = ip_lib.IPWrapper(root_helper, namespace)
    ip_wrapper.netns.execute(
    [NS_WRAPPER,
    '--mount_paths=/etc:%s/etc,/var/run:%s/var/run' % (
    self.config_dir, self.config_dir),
    '--cmd=%s' % ','.join(cmd)],
    check_exit_code=check_exit_code)

We are using check of net namespace (since linux 3.0),
instead of mount namespace (since Linux 3.8), as older
kernels do not support mount namespace. In addition,
mount --bind has been available since Linux 2.4. so we
don't need to worry kilo's minumum kernel requirement.

This patch is based on patchset67 of nachi's initial
vpnaas implementation, many thanks to nachi.

errors in the ironic logs, rather than generic server build failures
on the tempest side.

The get_available_resource method returns a dict with a number
of keys that are supposed to be common to all virt drivers.
There are a numer of places where the ironic driver is filling
in non-standard keys.

 - 'disk_total' and 'disk_used' contain identical info
   to the 'local_gb' and 'local_gb_used' fields

 - 'disk_available' mis-named should be 'disk_available_least'

 - 'host_memory_total' and 'host_memory_free' contain
   identical info to the 'memory_mb' and 'memory_mb_used' fields

 - 'node' - contains a UUID

 - 'host' contains a hostname

Further, every key in the 'stats' dict is also duplicated
at the top level dict too.

The resource_tracker.py update_available_resource method
which calls get_available_resource() will not process any
of these non-standard keys.

Simply delete them all, except 'disk_available' which is
renamed to 'disk_available_least'

When reporting the 'cpu_info' field in the get_available_resource

has mistakenly used printable architecture names, as opposed to
the canonical architecture names. Switch to use the compute.arch
constants.

Although this changes the data reported by hyperv, it should not
have a functional impact since only the libvirt driver is relying
on the precise format of this data. For hyperv it is merely
informational.

The 'cpu_info' field in the dict from get_available_resource
is supposed to provide information on the physical CPU model
used in the host, including arch, model, vendor, feature flags
and topology. The XenAPI Driver was simply returning the
raw 'host_cpu_info' dict it got back from XenSever. This
includes nearly all the desired information, but represented
in a different structure to what the libvirt driver has
provided.

This commit updates it to convert the data into a format
that is somewhat consistent with the libvirt driver.

This change adds a graceful shutdown arugment to the Service.stop
method in order to allow a service to gracefully wait for threads to
shutdown. Since threadgroup already supports a graceful shutdown
argument for its stop() method, it is trivial to support.

Added unit tests to demonstrate the expected behavior between graceful
and ungraceful service stop()s.

Runtime router variable dist_fip_count has been
used to keep track of FIPs for DVR routers.
This variable is not re-initialized correctly on
agent restart and can get stale from other errors
which cause problems with namespace and port cleanup.

This patch will initialize the ri.dist_fip_count
once in process_router for dvr routers only.  This
method was selected instead of the _router_added or
_router_removed path because it is the one central
entry point for rotuer add, delete, and update.

The object self.agent_gateway_port also needs to be
properly handled after an agent restart and this
patch will handle that as well.

When needed, the system will be read via system
calls to determine the state of namespaces and ports
since the variables cannot be relied on.
System calls will be kept to a minimum to reduce
and possible performance hits.

HA standby routers must never transmit traffic from
any of their ports. This is because we allocate the same
port on all agents. For example, for a given external interface,
we place the same port with the same IP/MAC on every agent
the HA router is scheduled on. Thus, if a standby router
transmits data out of that interface, the physical switches
in the datacenter will re-learn the MAC address of the external
port, and place it on a port that's looking at a standby and
not at the master. This causes 100% packet loss for any incoming
traffic that should be going through the master instance of the
router.

Keepalived manages addresses on the router interfaces, and makes
sure that these addresses only live on the master. However, we
forgot about IPv6 link local addresses. They are generated
from the MAC address of the interface, and thus are identical on
all agents.

This patch tries to treat IPv6 link local addresses the same
as IPv4 addresses - define them as VIPs and let keepalived
move them around.

An intermittent 404 would occur because of the way that
Tempest keystone v3 authprovider was resolving base URLs.
Barbican wasn't passing in a region code, and the tempest
v3 auth provider was picking the ""first"" entry in the
entrypoint list, which was often the Barbican admin URL
(port 9312).  Trying to use that port for normal Barbican
ReST calls resulted in the http 404.  This fix adds the
region to the devstack config and uses that on the filter
that Barbican gives to Tempest to find the correct
Barbican endpoint.

Migration scripts 037, 041, and 043 treat raw_template.template as if it
were a dict, but it's actually a string.  In those scripts, raw_template
is a RowProxy object, not a RawTemplate object (where
raw_template.template would, in fact, be a dict).  Furthermore, a
RowProxy object does not allow attributes to be set, yet that's exactly
what those migration scripts attempt to do.

Fetch a list of RawTemplates from the database instead of a ResultProxy
to ensure the migration scripts work properly.

This reverts commit a73c4eac9453f0ed09709962e486ef93a1f19922.

The REST API relies on neutron-specific policy checking logic that is
only available after the extensions are loaded and the
RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP is populated. This patch resets the policies
immediately after these steps are done. This ensures that in the event
the policies are prematurely loaded for any reason, the on-demand
loading of the policies will reload the policies and properly configure
the neutron specific checks on the next policy check.

The icehouse branch does not currently have support for using the conf.d

the configuration, except swift (which is not available in the icehouse

compatibility of the configuration process for all branches.
This patch also ensures that the plays executed are appropriate for the

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that
is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is
completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.
This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was
deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we
cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.
This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of
v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload
process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v1: 412 Precondition Failed
v2: 410 Gone

This patch set will enable the end point for post metrics to end
point /v2.0/metrics

other methods will be implemented based on elastic search in later
patch set. There will be a series of the patchset to eventually
have a complete implementation of metrics apis based on
elasticsearch.

this patch set also fixed the pep check errors in reference impl.

added unit test cases for elastic search impl.

Recently commit Ib6e0fc4e50c1ea144a9c538099e23597d66b429b
had made an explicit python version check for vnc function. This will
break the novnc functions for python under 2.7.4.

There are two problems for it:
1) The self.path argument will always be a relative path from the python
http basic module. If novnc, it will be 'websockify'. Hence, parse.scheme
will be always being empty.
2) Using python version to determine function compatible seems not to be
very appropariate. For example, Redhat 6.5 will ship with python2.6.6
but it already patched with urllibparse fix.

We should remove the version check for this part.

This patch adds code which garbage collects ports in neutron that are
not found in nova's network cache and should be deleted. These ports
usually manifest when nova-compute fails to receive a response from neutron
when creating a port due to a timeout. This patch needs to put a lock around
allocate_for_instance in order to prevent a possible race condition when
hotplugging a network-interface to an instance and the port is garbage
collected before its put into the network_cache.

with the original author.

incorrectly based on root_gb.  When booting from a volume Nova doesn't
track volume size internally, but the VDI of the attached volume matches
the volume size so we can use that for the auto_disk_config process.

Feature is most useful for flat networks where one may have several
projects/teams in one domain and hostnames are required to be unique
across the network or organisation. This will enable you to add
project_id and project_name to VMs by setting configuration variable
in nova.conf when using multi_instance_display_name_template,
for single instances you'd set single_instance_display_name_template
instead. multi_instance_display_name_template also has been amended
to be able to set project_id and/or project_name.

Adding two new configuration switches that would isolate guests
from accessing gateway IP adress directly if set to true.

* isolate_guests_from_gateway: Bool
  If set to true, will add iptables rules to drop all packet
  sent from a guest to the gateway but will let metadata
  packet go through unless use_libvirt_injection is set to
  true too.
* use_libvirt_injection: Bool
  If set to true, will not allow guests to reach metadata

  be set to true otherwise this switch wont be considered.

In the process of live_migration, if the user does not specify the
destination, the scheduler will choose a suitable host,  but the scheduler
can not choose hosts according to the driver_type and driver_version in
the existing scheduling method, especially in a heterogeneous environment,
it will lead to the migration failure probability increased, so I think
the OpenStack as an excellent choice should be able to deal with this
situation.
