When connecting volumes to the underlying host the virt drivers can
attempt to stash additional metadata returned from os-brick into the
connection_info associated with a bdm. This pretty janky behaviour
relies on someone later calling .save() against the underlying
BlockDeviceMapping object to persist these changes into the database as
happens in the driver block device layer during a standard volume
attach.

However during pre_live_migration no call was made to .save() resulting
in the changes made to the connection_info being lost. This change
simply introduces this call at the end of the pre_live_migration method
on the destination via the driver bdm objects we provide in
block_device_info.

During cleaving, if the sharder finds that zero object rows are copied
from the parent retiring DB to a cleaved shard DB, and if that shard
DB appears have been freshly created by the cleaving process, then the
sharder skips replicating that shard DB and does not count the shard
range as part of the batch (see Related-Change).

Previously, any shard range treated in this way would not have its
state moved to CLEAVED but would remain in the CREATED state. However,
cleaving of following shard ranges does continue, leading to anomalous
sets of shard range states, including all other shard ranges moving to
ACTIVE but the skipped range remaining in CREATED (until another
sharder visitation finds object rows and actually replicates the
cleaved shard DB).

These anomalies can be avoided by moving the skipped shard range to
the CLEAVED state. This is exactly what would happen anyway if the
cleaved DB had only one object row copied to it, or if the cleaved DB
had zero object rows copied to it but happened to already exist on
disk.

Fixes ``redfish`` RAID interface workflow to not create more than 1
logical disks per controller at the same time when controller does not
support 'Immediate' application time and system needs rebooting.

With this fix virtual disks are grouped by controller and executed
in batches when reboot is required.

This enables ``redfish`` RAID interface to be used with iDRAC systems
directly as although there are many controllers that support 'Immediate'
application time, they do it only when system has completed loading.
System intermittently completes loading after IPA starts executing
clean or deploy steps rendering controllers not supporting 'Immediate'
apply time and requiring reboot. This fix handles such scenario
instead of failing to create more than 1 virtual disk.

In the extract_host method, when returning the host name from the
string ""Host@Backend#Pool"", we do split two times.

First time we do with '#' which returns ""Host@Backend"" in 0th index
Second time we do with '@' which returns ""Host"" in 0th index

There is no need for the first split since splitting with '@' already
returns host in the 0th index so we remove the redundant split call.

Also removing the tests with format 'host#pool' since it is not a
valid format.

When moving an UNSHARDED broker into the SHARDING db state the important
information from the retiring DB needs to be moved into the fresh DB.
However, currently we are missing a whole bunch of container information
from the retiring db.
Currently we dont sync across the delete_timestamp, status or
status_changed_at metadata either. These are important bits of information
from the retiring DB.

Delete_timestamp for instance, might indicate the UNSHARDED container is
actually deleted, but there are objects inside that need to be dealt
with. Currently, when transitioning to the SHARDING state it effectively
undeletes itself.

This patch, when moving into the SHARDING DB state via
broker.set_sharding_state() now does an SQL update to
update bits of the container_stat metadata that doesn't have direct API access
from the broker. Namely delete_timestamp, status and status_changed_at.

To get the container status, I had to add status to the get_info SQL.
The fact that it had status_changed_at and not status feels like a bug,
so adding seems to be in scope for this change.

Building the Kolla ironic-conductor image for Ubuntu using Python 3.8 in

There is a lot of backtracking in the pip dependency resolver. I tried

When IPv6 is used on the LB+Member and a batch operation is
done over the members (including a delete of one of them),
the member affected remains in ERROR state.

This patch fix the way of extract the info from the member to
create the request to the helper correctly.

The removal of subtransactions was *not* an issue. Per Gorka's analysis:

  As far as I know the only purpose of using the subtransaction pattern
  in our code was to support both starting a new transaction (if no

This happens if a volume is detached while the volume is downloading

does not have build from source because TripleO Quickstart installs
the collection from job.required-projects [1]. The latter shadows the
RPM release which is installed later by TripleO because it has a
higher precedence in ansible.cfg [2][3].

Changed the job hierarchy to other base jobs tripleo-ci-centos-8-\
standalone-build and tripleo-ci-centos-9-standalone-build. This reduces
the number of variables we have to define. It is also cleaner since our
CentOS9 job is no longer based on the CentOS8 job which prevents
issues with job variant collections due to our branched repository.

Added more Ansible modules to files which trigger TripleO jobs,
because Ansible role os_tempest [4] requires those modules and is
called in TripleO jobs. Modules which have been added include:
* openstack.cloud.compute_flavor
* openstack.cloud.image
* openstack.cloud.network
* openstack.cloud.router
* openstack.cloud.subnet

Added tripleo-ci-centos-8-standalone-osa to experimental jobs so that we
can actually run this job on demand easily.

If you want to mock a function with another function, you must use
'side_effect' rather than 'return_value'. Using the latter will mean the
mocked function will return a function object. This was being obscured
because the '_update_snapshot_metadata' helper function in

mocking, we were also missing the fact that the mock should return a

some invalid values.

Correct all of the above.

Since sqlalchemy 1.4.14[1], the following warning is raised unless
the cache_ok flag is explicitly set in classes inheriting
TypeDecorator.

SAWarning: TypeDecorator Json() will not produce a cache key because
the ``cache_ok`` attribute is not set to True.  This can have
significant performance implications including some performance
degradations in comparison to prior SQLAlchemy versions.
Set this attribute to True if this type object's state is safe to use

Some jobs have been modified to run to confirm that functionality is
still working when FIPS is enabled on the nodes.

As the FIPS tests currently run on centos nodes, code is added
to the test-setup script to set up the databases correctly.  Also had
to increase the swap space on the nodes; see [0] for an explanation.

The current FIPS jobs run using python 3.6 on centos-8-stream.  We will
modify these to run on centos-9-stream and python 3.9 in a

Previously, S3 multi-deletes acted much like Swift bulk deletes; the
proxy would spin up a few greenthreads to go issue DELETEs for each
named object. This has the advantage of freeing up disk space
immediately, but (1) relies on the full object-update path to clean up
container listings and (2) takes a while to complete, as we have to
aggregate all of these individual DELETEs.

The listing-update lag in particular can cause cascading problems: some
clients, wishing to delete all items with a given prefix, may issue
repeated queries for that prefix to feed into a multi-delete request,
without including a marker or continuation token from the previous
listing. As a result, many DELETEs are issued for the same names,
further overloading the container server that's trying to eat updates
and causing listings to lag even further behind.

Now, multi-deletes update listings immediately, and enqueue jobs to
issue per-object deletes later. This has basically exactly the opposite
set of trade-offs: listings update quickly, client requests are fast,
but disk space takes a while to clean up and a GET for one of the
deleted objects may still return data.

Operators must specifically opt-in with the use_async_delete config
option.  The option is incompatible with multipart uploads, acls and
object versioning.

This builds on interfaces introduced with the operator async-delete tool.

Add a new config option ""backup_ceph_keep_snapshots_count"" to only keep
the last n snapshots of a volume backup on the source volume storage
to save disk space.
By default, the current behavior of keeping all snapshots is used, but
can now be adjusted as requested.

Commit bc9ab142da919087c71525978f960115ff0259b9 changed the previous
behavior of keeping only the last snapshot to keeping all snapshots of
a backup. However, this can take up much more disk space on the
source volume storage.

If enabled, the driver checks the number of snapshots of a volume backup
after successful creation of a new snapshot and removes older ones, so
that only the n most recent snapshots are kept on the source storage.

This change also creates a new special case which was not present
before: If a user deletes at least n backup snapshots, the next
incremental snapshot creation would fail (due to how RBD works).
This will be handled by forcing a full backup instead.

Therefore, this commit introduces a configurable tradeoff between
required space on the source volume storage and a potentially longer
backup time.

Compute service for IronicDriver had been supported multiple host from
Newton release, but an ironic instance can't be managed by nova if
its hypervisor is brought down. Even more serious, an IronicDriver
compute usually has a number of ironic hypervisor, while a compute
service goes down, many hypervisor go down. Fortunately, The ironic

3PAR driver creates a dependency chain when we create a volume from
a snapshot and while deleting the snapshot, it renames the dependent
volume and also changes some of it's properties to break the dependency
to finally delete the snapshot successfully.
During the renaming, 3PAR driver creates a new volume named ""omv-<id>""
which is different from the original volume name ""osv-<id>"".

NOTE: here ""id"" doesn't refer to OpenStack resource/volume ID but rather
the ID provided by backend.

We can fail to create the new volume for certain reasons and one of
the reason is there already exists an internal volume named ""omv-<id>""
Since the IDs are unique, this volume could be a side effect of a
failed operation earlier and the volume was not cleaned up.
The ERROR log in this failure case shows the original volume name
""osv-<id>"" with a Duplicate exception[1] which doesn't provide any
insight of the failure since we already know ""osv-<id>"" exists in
backend and we are failing due to ""omv-<id>"" volume which needs to
be manually cleaned up from 3PAR array.
This patch corrects the volume name in the above failure case.

[1] ERROR oslo_messaging.rpc.server cinder.exception.Duplicate: Volume (osv-<id>) already exists on array.

the openstack overcloud upgrade prepare does:
   - Stack download for ephemeral heat
   - Enable the user tripleo-admin on the overcloud nodes

The ansible inventory created uses the user heat-admin
which makes the creation of the playbooks do not work.
The ANSIBLE_USER variable does not work either as the
templates were generated with the heat-admin user.

To avoid executing twice the prepare command.
The patch not only enable the tripleo-admin user
to the host but also do a second download of the
configuration with the user tripleo-admin

to train, and does not support ussuri.  It supports upgrades
from bionic-queens to bionic-train (with each intermediate
step needed).  Crucially it does NOT set a default
openstack-origin, which means installing train/stable
without specifying the openstack-origin will result in a
bionic-queens installation.  This is intentional as the branch
covers queens to train.

OS-Brick uses file locks to ensure single access to critital sections,
and uses the oslo concurrency ""lock_path"" configuration option to
determine where to create these locks.

This is fine when each host has a single service using os-brick, which
is the case of Compute nodes and Controller nodes where Glance is not
using Cinder as its backend.

The problem happens when we have an HCI deployment where Cinder and Nova
are collocated on the same host or when Glance uses Cinder as its
backend and is running on the same host.  In those scenarios os-brick
will create file locks in different paths for each service, which is not
the intended behavior.

A possible solutions is to set the ""lock_path"" of all the services to
the same location, which is not great, not only because we'll have all
nova, cinder, glance, and os-brick locks mixed in a single location
(service prefixes help a bit here), but also because then Cinder will
have permissions on the Nova and Glance locks, which doesn't seem right.

This patch introduces a new mechanism in os-brick to have its own
""lock_path"" configuration option in the ""os_brick"" group.  It defaults
to the current behavior if not explicitly defined, so it will use olso
concurrency's ""lock_path"".

To do this the patch introduces the oslo.config dependency and adds a
new ""setup"" method that sets the default of the os_brick ""lock_path"".

This new ""setup"" method is required because the order in which
configuration options for the different namespaces are imported cannot
be guaranteed, so the setup must be called *after* the service has
already imported all (or at least the ones os-brick cares about)
configuration option namespaces.

In other words, when os-brick files are loaded the value for oslo
concurrency's ""lock_path"" is not yet known, so it cannot be used as a
default, and the oslo_config substitution feature does not support
values from other namespaces, so we cannot default the ""lock_path"" from
the os_brick namespace to the value in ""oslo_concurrency"".

Since the value that is going to be used as the ""lock_path"" is not known
until the ""setup"" method is called, we cannot use the standard
""synchronized"" method from ""oslo_concurrency.lock_utils"" and we need to
use our own.

In the current os-brick code, each connector that requires a lock is
importing and creating its own ""synchronized"" instance, but this patch
changes this behavior and creates a single instance, just like Cinder
does.

This feature requires changes in multiple projects -os-brick, cinder,
nova, glance, glance_store, devstack- to be fully supported, but this is
the base of all this effort.

this change makes the parameter hard-coded instead of requiring users

If token was created with `?nocatalog`, it will be cached w/o catalog,
and on token validation response will return token infoa also w/o catalog
until cache is invalidated.

Such catalog-less tokens break other services (e.g. Nova) as they rely

make grenade jobs as non voting for all EM stable and
oldest stable. grenade jobs are failing not and it might take
time to fix those if we are able to fix. Once it jobs are

The base target driver class is missing the extend_target method which
is called from the LVM driver.

Since it was missing there some drivers, such as the nvmeof base class,
also missed it when they were implemented.

This patch adds a base implementation that does nothing, since this is
usually the right thing to do for most drivers.

This patch adds a new variable to the build-test-packages role that
allows specifying arbitrary extra changes to be built. The intended use
case is for ad-hoc testing a change against a version of another
package that isn't currently being built by DLRN.

For example, the tripleo jobs in the master branch of
ansible-collections-openstack should be run against
openstacksdk>=0.99.0, but currently the rdo u-c[1] have openstacksdk
pinned to 0.61.0. With this change, ansible-collections-openstack can
tell build-test-packages to build the correct version[2].

This change enhances one of our tests to ensure that in a

Previously, the libvirt driver defaulted to 1024 * (# of CPUs) for the
value of domain/cputune/shares in the libvirt XML. This value is then
passed directly by libvirt to the cgroups API. Cgroups v2 imposes a
maximum value of 10000 that can be passed in. This makes Nova
unable to launch instances with more than 9 CPUs on hosts that run
cgroups v2, like Ubuntu Jammy or RHEL 9.

Fix this by just removing the default entirely. Because there is no
longer a guarantee that domain/cputune will contain at least a shares
element, we can stop always generating the former, and only generate
it if it will actually contain something.

We can also make operators's lives easier by leveraging the fact that
we update the XML during live migration, so this patch also adds a
method to remove the shares value from the live migration XML if one
was not set as the quota:cpu_shares flavor extra spec.

For operators that *have* set this extra spec to something greater
than 10000, their flavors will have to get updates, and their
instances resized.

ServerGroup resources work as scheduler hints for server
resources and replacement of it replaces the servers which
is undesirable in many circumstances.

- We don't allow update of ServerGroup resource properties
- If not created (CREATE_FAILED) without resource_id they will
  be replaced
- If does not exist in nova they would be created
- If exist in nova, FAILED resource status would be just
  changed to COMPLETE

ServerGroup resources work as scheduler hints for server
resources and replacement of it replaces the servers which
is undesirable in many circumstances.

- We don't allow update of ServerGroup resource properties
- If not created (CREATE_FAILED) without resource_id they will
  be replaced
- If does not exist in nova they would be created
- If exist in nova, FAILED resource status would be just
  changed to COMPLETE

This change finds a node with the same name as the allocation and
moves it to the beginning of the shuffled candidate list so that node
is the first allocation attempt.

It is common for node naming scheme to match the node's role (such as
compute-1, compute-2). Also this often matches the hostname
