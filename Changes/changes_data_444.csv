On hosts with dvr_snat agent mode, after restarting OVS agent,
sometimes the SNAT port is processed first instead of the distributed port.
The subnet_info is cached locally via get_subnet_for_dvr when either of these ports
are processed. However, it returns the MAC address of the port used to query
as the gateway for the subnet. Using the SNAT port, this puts the wrong
MAC as the gateway, causing some flows such as the DVR flows on br-int
for local src VMs to have the wrong MAC.

This patch fixes the get_subnet_for_dvr with fixed_ips as None for the csnat port,
as that causes the server side handler to fill in the subnet's actual gateway
rather than using the port's MAC.

The Neutron OVS agent logs can get flooded with KeyErrors as the
'_get_port_info' method skips the added/removed dict items if no
ports have been added/removed, which are expected to be present,
even if those are just empty sets.

This change ensures that those port info dict fields are always set.

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run

The Placement API has the concept of resource provider generations to
enable the co-ordination of multiple API clients, so they can avoid
accidentally overwriting each other's updates.

However when we know that a single client writes certain resource
providers then the generation handling becomes an unnecessary extra
API round-trip. Ideally the Placement API would give us a chance to
express our ignorance about multi-client coordination (accepting that
a single client can overwrite its own previous updates).

Until the Placement API gives us such a feature we implement it in
the client lib, by making 'resource_provider_generation' parameters
optional.  This is inferior to the API doing the same because we may
still see GenerationConflict exceptions even when we said
method(..., resource_provider_generation=None).

Later changes for the minimum guaranteed bandwidth
feature need 'resource_provider_generation' to be
optional for 'update_resource_provider_traits' and
'update_resource_provider_inventories'. For the sake of consistency
we do the same to 'update_resource_provider_inventory'.

Like change Ia584dba66affb86787e3069df19bd17b89cb5c49 which
came before, is port binding fails and we have a ""binding_failed""
vif type in the info cache, we'll fail to plug vifs for an
instance on compute restart which will prevent the service
from restarting. Before the os-vif conversion code, this was
handled with VirtualInterfacePlugException but the os-vif conversion
code fails in a different way by raising a generic NovaException
because the os-vif conversion utility doesn't handle a vif_type of
""binding_failed"".

To resolve this and make the os-vif flow for binding_failed behave
the same as the legacy path, we implement a translation function
in os_vif_util for binding_failed which will make the plug_vifs
code raise VirtualInterfacePlugException which is what the
_init_instance code in ComputeManager is already handling.

Admittedly this isn't the smartest thing and doesn't attempt
to recover / fix the instance networking info, but it at least
gives a more clear indication of what's wrong and lets the
nova-compute service start up. A note is left in the
_init_instance error handling that we could potentially try
to heal binding_failed vifs in _heal_instance_info_cache, but
that would need to be done in a separate change since it's more
invasive.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements

with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

In Pike[1], we introduced a user_group auto detection for haproxy.
The default user group name is auto-detected for any OS distribution
we support as a base for Amphorae.

user_group remained as an option for admins but was also
marked deprecated in Pike[2].

This patch removes that option altogether.

The direct deploy interface looks promising in the scale tests so far,
but it prevent local testing and PoC with nodes with less than 8 GiB
RAM because it has to convert the overcloud-full image in memory.

This change changes back to the iscsi deploy interface, leaving

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run

As part of sprint 16 we want to remove tripleo.sh usage from ci in

This was initially proposed as stand-alone role in [2] but discussion
has led us to keeping only creation of the ceph loop device, added

in the pre-run for the tripleo-ci-base job (zuul-v3) but not for

This removes any calls to tripleo.sh --bootstrap-subnodes from the

adds the new tripleo-ci/ceph.yaml in pre-run of tripleo-ci-base

This adds a v2 storage interface as well as a gnocchi backend for it to
cloudkitty. This new interface will allow us to implement the v2 API, which will
be more metric-oriented.

This new storage uses the new dataframe format ('desc' is now split up into
'groupby' and 'metadata', following the collect logic); and supports grouping,
filters and pagination.

Modifications:

  * The tenant/scope state management isn't handled by the storage backend
    anymore. A StateManager object has been added.

  * All internal interactions with the storage backend use the v2 interface.
    An adapter class has been added to ensure retrocompatibility with the
    v1 interface.

  * A base class for functional tests testing the v2 storage interface has been
    added. It contains generic tests, which should allow easier testing for new
    v2 backends.

  * Some developer documentation explaining how to implement a v2 storage
    backend has been added. User documentation will be updated once the v2
    storage backend is considered stable.

The v1 is still the default storage version. Note that this new version is
considered unstable and should only be used for upstream development.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

In order to reduce the packages required to pip install on to the hosts,
we use service delegation to octavia_service_setup_host so that instead
of installing software on the target host, and putting credentials on
every target host, we isolate the software and credentials to a single
host.

In this patch we finally remove octavia_requires_pip_packages as it is
no longer required given that all services use delegation to the
octavia_service_setup_host now. We also remove the task which used to
install them.

We also remove the meta dependency on the openstack_openrc role because
the target host does not require openrc/clouds.yaml any more.

We remove the variable 'octavia_ansible_endpoint_type' as it is no longer
used.

We finally remove the python-pip package from the distro packages, as
with these changes, pip is no longer required on the host - everything
installed by pip is isolated into a venv.

1. Remove tests/test-configure-octavia.yml because the 'shade' package
   does not need to be installed again - this is already done by the
   role test preparation.

2. Remove the key generation as the keys are already generated in the
   common tests playbook 'test-prepare-keys.yml'.

3. Add some spacing between tasks to make it more readable.

4. Implement the extra packages needed in test-requirements.txt instead
   of trying to use a task to install them, because doing it in Ansible
   makes understanding the venv in relation to the inventory complicated..

5. Move the vars_files argument to the top of the play to make it easier
   to find and more uniform with other plays in OSA.

6. Switch from using octavia_ansible_endpoint_type to a hard-coded
   endpoint, then remove the octavia_ansible_endpoint_type var.

7. Switch from using the 'endpoint_type' argument for the openstack
   modules to using the more modern 'interface' argument.

8. Remove the 'run_once' argument on the 'Upload key to nova' task

9. Remove the 'Set VIP fact' task in favor of just using the 'vip_output'

10. To help the existing patches pass, we add python-pip to the distro

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving

The default quotas are often not sufficient for a side wide
load balancing service. This will adjust them to some more
reasonable values.

The os_quota module of ansible assumes an installed
block storage service so it is not suitable for our

the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

The TESTING_BRANCH environment variable is provided by the
run_tests.sh script and is derived from the .gitreview file.

This ensures that once the master branch becomes a stable
branch, the constraints from the stable branch in the

we export them appropriately in run_tests.sh and modify the

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration

repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

Under certain conditions detaching a multipath device may result on
failure when flushing one of the individual paths, but the disconnect
should have succeeded, because there were other paths available to flush
all the data.

OS-Brick is currently following standard recommended disconnect
mechanism for multipath devices:

- Release all device holders
- Flush multipath
- Flush single paths
- Delete single devices

The problem is that this procedure does an innecessary step, flushing
individual single paths, that may result in an error.

Originally it was thought that the individual flushes were necessary to
prevent data loss, but upon further study of the multipath-tools and the
device-mapper code it was discovered that this is not really the case.

After the multipath flushing has been completed we can be sure that the
data has been successfully sent and acknowledge by the device.

The issue is resolved for Dell EMC PowerEdge 13th and 14th generation
servers. It is not resolved for PowerEdge 12th generation and earlier
servers.

Prior to this change, the set_boot_device() function in
ironic.drivers.modules.drac.management could successfully set a boot
device that would persist during future boots only when the server's
boot mode was configured to be BIOS. The root cause was that function
understood only a single persistent boot mode, BIOS, and it was hard
coded.

PERSISTENT_BOOT_MODE = 'IPL'

Initial Program Load (IPL) is a synonym for legacy BIOS boot mode.

The iDRAC does not report nor make visible the boot source lists for
persistent boot modes that are not configured as the server's current
boot mode. Only the list associated with the configured boot mode is
reported and can be modified. So, when the boot mode is configured to be
UEFI, the iDRAC permits only its boot source list to be modified.
However, set_boot_device() had been capable of only modifying the boot
source list for BIOS (IPL), which was not reported. Its attempt to
access the wrong, unreported boot source list failed.

This change fixes the issue by determining the configured persistent
boot mode at run-time and modifying its boot source list. The hard
coding of a persistent boot mode has been eliminated. Now, nodes managed
by the iDRAC hardware type successfully boot in either persistent boot
mode, BIOS or UEFI. More information about using the iDRAC for boot
management is available in the ""Dell EMC BIOS and Boot Management
Profile"", Version 4.0.0, section 7.2 Boot Management, pp. 44-47 [1].

The way the iDRAC hardware type deploys the operating system, by copying
it to a disk, posed an additional challenge to this fix. UEFI discovers
new boot sources during the next boot. How could the server be
configured to directly boot into the newly deployed operating system
when its boot source is unknown? It was overcome by using new iDRAC BIOS
attributes named 'SetBootOrderFqddNN' [2]. Those make it possible to
specify the boot source for the next boot without requiring it to be
present in the current boot's boot source list. The server is configured
to directly boot from the disk on which the operating system was just
deployed. An additional reboot is not required. Note that those new
attributes are presently available on only 13th and 14th generation
servers. Also, this approach is only possible for configuring a
persistent boot source.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements

Upon investigating, I found that it's the deletion of the first server
in the test that fails for ""Invalid volume"" and it's because we delete
the server *after* we've created a snapshot of it (which creates a
volume snapshot). So the first volume, backing the first server, has a
snapshot and that first volume cannot be deleted until the snapshot is
deleted.

This adds a deletion of the volume snapshot and moves the deletion of
the first server after it.

with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

This patch delivers the first working version of a distributed
scheduler implementation based on local and persistent job
queues. The idea is inspired by the parallel computing pattern
known as ""Work stealing"" although it doesn't fully repeat it
due to a nature of Mistral.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing for details.

Advantages of this scheduler implementation:

* It doesn't have job processing delays when a cluster topology'
  is stable caused by DB polling intervals. A job gets scheduled
  in memory and also saved into the persistent storage for
  reliability. A persistent job can be picked up only after a
  configured allowed period of time so that it happens effectively
  after a node responsible for local processing crashed.
* Low DB load. DB polling still exists but it's not a primary
  scheduling mechamisn now but rather a protection from node crash
  situations. That means that a polling interval can now be made
  large like 30 seconds, instead of 1-2 seconds. Less DB load
  leads to less DB deadlocks between scheduler instances and less
  retries on MySQL.
* Since DB load is now less it gives better scalability properties.
  A bigger number of engines won't now lead to much bigger
  contention because of a big DB polling intervals.
* Protection from having jobs forever hanging in processing state.
  In the existing implementation, if a scheduler captured a job
  for processing (set its ""processing"" flag to True) and then
  crashed then a job will be in processing state forever in the DB.
  Instead of a boolean ""processing"" flag, the new implementation
  uses a timestamp showing when a job was captured. That gives us
  the opportunity to make such jobs eligible for recapturing and
  further processing after a certain configured timeout.

TODO:

* More testing
* DB migration for the new scheduled jobs table
* Benchmarks and testing under load
* Standardize the scheduler interface and write an adapter for the
  existing scheduler so that we could choose between scheduler
  implementations. It's highly desired to make transition to the
  new scheduler smooth in production: we always need to be able
  to roll back to the existing scheduler.

'expected_error_codes' are filled with defaults error code[1]

of error codes with 403.

Few tests override the 'expected_error_codes' with 403 itself which
is confusing and inconsistent with other tests.

This commit removes those default overridden values.
