Now that the CI job playbooks are ran

This is the case of the ""deploy_args_used"" one,

be used in overcloud-upgrade.

This patch makes the fact cacheable, so
overcloud-upgrade role can make use of it.

We've run into problems because we weren't maintaining older
deliverable files as we extended the schema. This change moves schema
validation out of the main validation command so it runs as a separate
step and processes all deliverable files by default. The more complex
validation rules are still only checked for files being modified in a
given commit.

We've been warning that these are deprecated for awhile now, and
we now have enforcement in place to make sure no new highlights
are added.

We also have some automation that rewrites the deliverable files
but does not always do a great job, resulting in poorly formatted
text that causes warnings in the validation job.

Since many folks new to the release process, and some that have
done it for awhile, look at existing files to see what to do for
new releases, they do assume highlights should be used and end up
adding them to their deliverable file. Since most of these also
do not know to run local validatation, this results in gate
resources being used to just now be rejected with the current
checks.

To help prevent this from happening, and to get rid of the warning
messages from poor reformatting, this just removes highlights
from the last few releases.

We added logic to change underscores to dashes when checking package

this caused some checks to fail.

This changes the check to try the expected sdist name first, and if

Because of the big Exception block in _validate_bdm, the
multiattach-specific errors raised out of the
_check_attach_and_reserve_volume method were being lost
and the very generic InvalidBDMVolume was returned to the
user.

For example, I hit this when trying to create a server from
a multiattach volume but forgot to specify microversion 2.60
and it was just telling me it couldn't get the volume, which
I knew was bogus since I could get the volume details.

The fix is to handle the specific errors we want to re-raise.

The tests, which missed this because of their high-level mocking,
are updated so that we actually get to the problematic code and
only the things we don't care about along the way are mocked out.

The current fernet rotation happens every 5 minutes with a token
expiry of 40 minutes.   This means that after 15 minutes, all
tokens are expired.  This causes Nova to fail for some operations
because it's tokens are now expired.

This adjusts the maximum active keys to 5 and rotation every 10
minutes which will mean that we'll rotate at least once during
the tempest runs which lasts around 15 minutes while keeping all
tokens valid for the entire 40 minutes.

This change will allow snapshots created by the SMBFS driver to be
attached in read-only mode. This will be used in order to backup
in-use volumes.

Note that writing to a snapshot would corrupt the differencing image
chain.

We'll need to locate snapshot backing files. The issue is that
in some cases, in-place locks may prevent us from querying the top
image from the chain. For this reason, we're going to store the
backing file information in the DB using the snapshot object
metadata field, at the same time preserving backwards compatibility.

Fake volume/snapshot object usage throughout the smbfs driver unit
tests had to be updated due to the object changes performed by it.

This commit makes to handle a stestr execution for stackviz process.
Tempest is now in the process of switching the tempest run command to
use stestr internally instead of testrepository. This means that results
will be stored in .stestr instead of .testrepository. So, this commit
makes to handle a stestr or testrepository execution with checking which
directory exists before attempting to process the subunit results.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements

Historically, we did not have a prohibition upon removing
a VIF entry stored in the extra field, however the VIF
attachment/detachment feature resulted in a task being
created which by default attempts to pull a reservation
lock unless explicitly shared.

This is problematic as part of the process of undeploying
a node as exclusive locks are generated.

Presently, if any of those locked tasks run long, such as
a new image being required or for some crazy reason,
the BMC power request hangs for a few minutes, the VIF
record may be orphaned and never removed, as the
expectation is that nova deletes the VIF record from ironic.

This allows the VIF record to be removed when a node is
no longer in active use and possibly subject to a lock being
held for a long period of time, such as when setting up
for CLEANING.

Additionally, this patch moves the actual VIF record
deletion until after the detachment action in the
event that it fails. This allows for the state in
ironic to be consistent instead of the record
being removed before the detachment occurs.

It reuses the global pylint job
and few jobs from sahara-tests (scenario, tempest), mimicking
the existing definitions of the legacy jobs.

Still missing: grenade (there is no common grenade job yet at this
point).

This version is more simplified than the version committed to master:
- no buildimages jobs (not available in ocata);
- no experimental python 3 jobs (it's not going to be fixed anyway);
- no experimental multinode jobs (let's rely on the legacy one for
  the short lifetime left for stable/ocata);
- no modwsgi job (available only from pike).

Using Puppet stdlib in TripleO is risky because it exposes deployments
to dependency cycles in the catalog.
We should rather use native functions to make orchestrations, like
ordering and dependencies management.

This patch:

- removes usage of stages from stdlib
- use ordering to make sure we run pre rules before post
- use ordering to make sure we start all Services in catalog before post
  rules. It ensure that we don't drop all traffic before starting the
  services, which could lead to services errors (e.g. trying to reach database
  or amqp)

Let's get rid of jenkins in the name and use a new place to place
bindep-fallback.txt in.

Create new nodepool element to copy the file over.

This is a first of two changes for this repo, we also need to update
the few users in bindep and openstack-zuul-jobs before we can remove the
old location.

We can remove jenkins/data/bindep-fallback.txt only in the followup
change since project-config is not self-testing.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the

Instead of relying on the presence of db files to determine the
progress of sharding a container, maintain explicit state in sysmeta
for each node index. This allows for the db file naming and/or
composition to be changed without impacting sharder state. For
example, losing a db file due to corruption, or gaining a db file due
to rsync replication, will no longer change the sharder state.

For the time being, retain the backend broker's notion of db state
because it is still useful for gating db file operations.

It defines buildimages/CLI jobs, and reuses the global pylint job

Few changes compared to the zuul jobs for master and queens:
- sahara-buildimages-cloudera is defined
- no experimental python 3 jobs (unlikely to be fixed for this

The redirect/fallback mecanism in place for BGPVPN with OVS
consists in (a) redirecting traffic to the gateway to br-mpls
(b) having a fallback if the traffic does not match any VPN route,
resulting in the traffic reaching a Neutron router if one is
connected to the network.

Before this change, the behavior was to:
- start ARP-spoofing the gateway MAC, using a special MAC X,
  as soon as a BGPVPN association exist, and keep doing it
  if a Neutron Router is connected to the network
- redirect all traffic to MAC X to br-mpls
- traffic not matching any VPN route in br-mpls is sent back
  to br-int, after rewriting its src mac to special MAC Y,
  and its destination MAC to the MAC address Z of the 'real'
  router implemented by Neutron L3agent

This behavior has drawbacks resulting from ARP spoofing the
gateway IP:
- some ARP voodoo need to be in place to block legitimate ARP
  from a real router (both responses and answers)
- when adding a BGPVPN association on a network on which
  a Neutron router is already connected, the real router MAC
  remains in hosts ARP cache for an undetermined amount of
  time, resulting in lack of BGPVPN connectivity until the
  gateway ARP entry expires

The new behavior introduced by this change consists in:
- only answering ARP requests for the gateway IP with IP MAC X
  when there is no Neutron router on the network
- (unchanged:) redirect all traffic to MAC X to br-mpls
- when a real router with MAC Z is connected, redirect to br-mpls
  all traffic to this MAC ; in the case where the gateway is
  plugged directly onto br-int (e.g. single node setup or DVR setup)
  this redirection also needs to be done in br-int which requires
  using the openvswitch firewall driver (that adds network vlan
  in an OVS register, the only way to correlate a packet with a
  network in br-int)
- (unchanged): traffic not matching any VPN route in br-mpls is
  sent back to br-int, after rewriting its src mac to special MAC Y,
  and its destination MAC to MAC Z
- ensure that fallback'd traffic that went through br-tun/br-mpls
  br-int/br-tun does not loop back into br-mpls again: the traffic
  with src MAC Y does not go from br-tun to br-mpls
- in bagpipe-bgp, disabling the ARP responder, because its answer
  would race with a legitimate answer

Add a new label 'cert_manager_api' to kubernetes clusters controlling the
enable/disable of the kubernetes certificate manager api.

The same cluster cert/key pair is used by this api. The heat agent is used
to install the key in the master node(s), as this is required for kubernetes
to later sign new certificate requests.

The master template init order is changed so the heat agent is launched
previous to enabling the services - the controller manager requires the CA key
to be locally available before being launched.

change public net to be the only required config option and have the

* add a call to oslo.config.cfg.import_group so that the function

  access them
* move the location where these options are defined into the
  module's __init__ so that they can be imported without causing a

Previously Ports tab in ""Add Firewall Group"" form and ""Rules"" tab
in ""Add Firewall Policy"" provided poor UX.
This commit improves them to more interactive UI
as FWaaS v1 ""Add Firewall Policy"" form does.

Note that static files are moved to static/neutron_fwaas_dashboard.
If we place static files directly under 'static' directory,
after collectstatic runs they cannot be distinguished from
static files from horizon or other plugins.

The previous code assumes a list of api.neutron.Port objects

It seems to come from copy-and-paste of FWaaS v1 code without testing.

This commit changes a value to be displayed from name/ID of ports

a good idea to show all ports in the firewall group table.

Recently this change [1] in glance-manage db_sync is internally
using Expand, Migrate and Contract. EMC is explicitly used for
online migration for which glance uses triggers to sync data
between old columns and new columns. DB Sync is used for
offline migartion for which adding triggers is not required.

Made provision to execute triggers explicitly in case of
online migration (EMC pattern) and skip the same in
case of offline migration (db sync).

If the user creates a volume-backed server from an existing
volume, the API reserves the volume by creating an attachment
against it. This puts the volume into 'attaching' status.

If the user then deletes the server before it's created in a
cell, by deleting the build request, the attached volume is
orphaned and requires admin intervention in the block storage
service.

This change simply pulls the BDMs off the BuildRequest when
we delete the server via the build request and does the same
local cleanup of those volumes as we would in a ""normal"" local
delete scenario that the instance was created in a cell but
doesn't have a host.

We don't have to worry about ports in this scenario since
ports are created on the compute, in a cell, and if we're
deleting a build request then we never got far enough to
create ports.

This is another wrinkle for bug 1404867 where we create a
volume-backed server, create an attachment on the volume which
puts the volume in 'attaching' status, and then delete the server
before it's actually created in a cell.

In this case, the _delete_while_booting code in the compute API
finds and deletes the BuildRequest before the instance was ever
created in a cell.

The bug is that _delete_while_booting in the API doesn't also
process block device mappings and unreserve/delete attachments
on the volume, which orphans the volume and can only be fixed
with admin intervention in the block storage service.

The RootHistory intends to record by whom and when the root user of the
underlying datastore backend was enabled. So the ""user"" column should
always be set to the context user, not the actual root user in the
database. But report_root(and report_root_enabled in
taskmanager.models) use the database user instead, this is not correct,
This patch will fix.

Also remove the ""user"" argument from Root.create() and
HistoryRoot.create() because the context is already passed in as an
argument when these methods are called.

Usually, when instance.host = None, it means the instance was never
scheduled. However, the exception handling routine in compute manager
[1] will set instance.host = None and set instance.vm_state = ERROR
if the instance fails to build on the compute host. If that happens, we
end up with an instance with host = None and vm_state = ERROR which may
have ports and volumes still allocated.

This adds some logic around deleting the instance when it may have
ports or volumes allocated.

  1. If the instance is not in ERROR or SHELVED_OFFLOADED state, we
     expect instance.host to be set to a compute host. So, if we find
     instance.host = None in states other than ERROR or
     SHELVED_OFFLOADED, we consider the instance to have failed
     scheduling and not require ports or volumes to be freed, and we
     simply destroy the instance database record and return. This is
     the ""delete while booting"" scenario.

  2. If the instance is in ERROR because of a failed build or is
     SHELVED_OFFLOADED, we expect instance.host to be None even though
     there could be ports or volumes allocated. In this case, run the
     _local_delete routine to clean up ports and volumes and delete the
     instance database record.

If a compute host satisfy such conditions,
- some well known IP address from RFC5737 is not used and
- there is no default gateway and
- my_ip in nova.conf is not set
then host_ip is set as 127.0.0.1(localhost). Eventhough destination
IP of resizing is same with current hypervisor host_ip, it is not the
same host. So one condition to check a localhost IP or not is added.

be fairly expensive. The API has a parameter to disable output
resolution: this adds this parameter to the get_stack call, and use it

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

When a conductor managing a node dies abruptly mid cleaing, the
node will get stuck in the CLEANING state.

This also moves _start_service() before creating CLEANING nodes
in tests. Finally, it adds autospec to a few places where the tests
fail in a mysterious way otherwise.

There are a few places where we mount the config drive which
is not done in a consistent manner which results in failures
for the cases where the config drive is VFAT, which makes the
device label report as CONFIG-2 and not config-2 (uppercase).

This refactors the mounting and unmounting codebase to the
same block and reuses it to ensure a consistent behaviour across
tests, also letting the tags checks pass when using VFAT for
config drives.

The Nova project has made the decision to store the entire
contents of the ""sql_connection"" field in the database, with
alterations to the host value, such that various ""cells"" database
URLs can be located using Nova's database itself as a central
registry of database URLs.

This architecture has produced several problems.   The first
is that it is impossible to apply parameters to the URL that
are local to the client machine; the leading example of this
is the MySQL ""bind_host"" variable, which must match the hostname
of the connecting host.  Because cells puts these URLs into the
database and shares them with all controllers, we have to use a workaround
with the read_default_file parameter to specify a controller-local
file of options; this is not a standard thing
for other database drivers, and these parameters only apply to
the MySQL driver and not the SQLAlchemy engine.

The next issue is that it is inconvenient to add parameters
to the URL at all, once Nova has already been running, as one
must manually use Nova's command line tools
to alter all the URLs that have already been copied into the database
and alter the query parameters with each of those individually,
and then restart *all* services who will all receive the parameter
(no way to add params to just one controller).

Nova's ""store the URL in the database"" feature only needs to be able
to locate the host / database name of the alternate database,
and not change the URL tuning parameters.   This patch adds a new
oslo.db parameter connection_parameters which allows the params to
be applied separately from the sql_connection parameter, so that
Nova can continue persisting sql_connection but the parameters remain
local to the nova.conf file.   A URL parameter that truly had to remain
persisted in Nova's database (there aren't any) could still be applied
at the sql_connection level.

This feature is essential not just so that we can again place
simple parameters into controller-local files like ""bind_host"", but
also to allow for configuration of SQLAlchemy features such as
plugins that do connection pool monitoring.

Due to the simplification of group vars [1], we've removed the
definition of cinder_service_region for magnum.

The magnum role has been simplified in a separate commit to remove the
dependency on this weak linki (scoping only inside its role),
still allowing it to be overriden by a deployer. (See dependant commit).

With that included, we only needed to wire the magnum_service_region
in group vars, so we wire the magnum_service_region inside the magnum
group to the standard ""service_region"" variable, which puts
everything at the same region, like all the other services are doing,
and also standardizes the configuration.

When rebuilding and changing the image, we run the new image
through the scheduler to see if it's valid for the instance
on its current compute host. The API saves off the new image
ref on the instance before casting to conductor to run through
the scheduler. If the scheduler fails, the instance.image_ref was
not being rolled back, which meant a user could attempt the rebuild
with the same invalid image a second time and the API, seeing the
instance.image_ref hasn't changed (even though it's not the actual
backing image for the server), will bypass the scheduler and rebuild
the instance with that invalid image.

This fixes the issue by using the original image ref, passed from
API to conductor during rebuild, to reset the instance.image_ref
in the case of a failure.

Note that there are other things changed on the instance in the API
which this patch does not attempt to recover as that's a bigger
work item which likely involves substantial refactoring of the code.

In nova in Queens, the ironic virt driver may set instance_info.traits
to a JSON encoded list. As instance_info is already stored as a JSON
blob in the DB, this is inefficient. While this issue in the nova virt
driver is likely to be fixed in a release in the Queens series, at least
the first release of nova for Queens (17.0.0) will not contain the fix.

This change modifies the node update (PATCH) API to check for an update
to instance_info.traits, and decode the list if it is JSON encoded. An
online data migration is likely still required in Rocky to decode any
instance_info.traits updates processed prior to this change. This will
allow us to remove support for JSON encoded instance_info.traits in the
S release.

A recently merged change [1] requires that either the SUPER privilege is
set for the Glance DB user or the option log_bin_trust_function_creators
variable is set. The latter one looks safer, thus setting it before the
Glance db_sync is executed and revoking it afterwards.

This patch enables log_bin_trust_function_creators function at step 2,
so db_sync command can work at step 3 and then disable the function at
step 4.

When a user updates from a deprecated resource type to an
equivalent-but-differently-named one (e.g. from
OS::Heat::SoftwareDeployments to OS::Heat::SoftwareDeploymentGroup), Heat
is supposed to change the type without replacing the resource as it would
normally do when a resource type changes. This was broken in convergence,
because since 45073226752c58d640ea5a59b7e532c022a4939b the new Resource
object we create during the check_resource operation (using the new type's
plugin) is no longer automatically initialised with data from the database
as resources in the legacy path are.

Move the substitution checking to the Resource.load() method, so that it
now returns an instance of the new plugin where allowed. In the actual
update_convergence() method then we need only check that the resource class
is the one we'd expect from the new template, and replace the resource if
not.

We do have a test that is designed to check that this is working, but in it
we didn't compare the physical IDs of the resource that is potentially
getting replaced, but rather the physical IDs of some other resource that
can't possibly get modified (surprise! it doesn't change).

Conflicts:
	heat/engine/resource.py

This patch is modified with respect to the one on master, since the
branch does not contain 960f626c2455b77e654aea1d79597fadb91dc894. Thus,
resource_owning_stack.defn is substituted for initial_stk_defn and
curr_stack.defn for latest_stk_defn.

It is also modified with respect to the one on stable/pike, since the
branch does not contain 764b8fb25132ac60c7760f134b78d600269ff516 or
a7376f7494b310e9367ebe5dcb43b432a4053023. Thus, resource definitions are
obtained from the Template rather than the StackDefinition.

When the keystonemiddleware is used directly in the WSGI stack of an
application, the 503 that is raised when the keystone service errors
or cannot be reached needs to identify that keystone is the service
that has failed, otherwise it appears to the client that it is the
service they are trying to access is down, which is misleading.

This addresses the problem in the most straightforward way possible:
the exception that causes the 503 is given a message including the
word ""Keystone"".

The call method in BaseAuthTokenTestCase gains an
expected_body_string kwarg. If not None, the response body (as
a six.text_type) is compared with the value.

This is another wrinkle for bug 1404867 where we create a
volume-backed server, create an attachment on the volume which
puts the volume in 'attaching' status, and then delete the server
before it's actually created in a cell.

In this case, the _delete_while_booting code in the compute API
finds and deletes the BuildRequest before the instance was ever
created in a cell.

The bug is that _delete_while_booting in the API doesn't also
process block device mappings and unreserve/delete attachments
on the volume, which orphans the volume and can only be fixed
with admin intervention in the block storage service.

In certain cases, such as when an instance fails to be scheduled,
the volume may already have an attachment created (or the volume
has been reserved in the old flows).

This patch adds a test to check that these volume attachments
are deleted and removed once the instance has been deleted. It
also adds some functionality to allow checking when an volume
has been reserved in the Cinder fixtures.

This backported patch drops the tests for the new-attach flow
for Cinder as it does not exist in Ocata.

If an instance fails to get scheduled, it gets buried in cell0 but
none of it's block device mappings are stored.  At the API layer,
Nova reserves and creates attachments for new instances when
it gets a create request so these attachments are orphaned if the
block device mappings are not registered in the database somewhere.

This patch makes sure that if an instance is being buried in cell0,
all of it's block device mappings are recorded as well so they can
be later removed when the instance is deleted.

We can't use audit middleware with services like Swift, which have no
dependency on Oslo and does not work well with oslo_log. Swift uses rsyslog.
Currently, audit middleware indiscriminately chooses oslo_messaging if the
package is installed. This is problematic if Swift proxy is on the same
controller as any service which consumes oslo_messaging. With this new option,
Swift can now safely consume audit middleware by electing to use local
log notifier instead of oslo_messaging.

We need a trivial change to trigger documentation publishing. This
makes the wording of the contributor instructions a little more welcoming.

The following adjustments are made in order to modernise
bring the role into line with the other mainline roles:

1. Simplify the constraints mechanism.

2. Add the developer mode constraints functionality.

3. Clean up developer mode logic to allow pip installs
   into an existing venv if the deployer chooses to do so.

4. Normalise the distro package install task to make it
   use the same name, to add retries and ensure that the
   cache updates appropriately.

5. Clean up some commented vars and tasks which were not
   used.

6. Simplify the use of checksums for the venv downloads
   to use modern Ansible functionality.

7. Add additional python venv prep for SuSE/CentOS.

8. Add the recording of the current venv tag deployed.

In I2c50bb693dc5dc505bddce34ff45294ac44f7dc9 we applied changes
to the settings to repo_build_venv_command_options so that pip,
setuptools and wheel were not copied into the new virtualend on
creation, but rather installed into it later.

Unfortunately the patch missed that CentOS and SuSE platforms
have an override for the same variable, so the issue set out in
the patch still applies to those platforms.

This patch ensures that the overrides are removed and the
variable is only declared in one place, but the same functionality
which gave rise to the override for those platforms is still
applied when executed.

If you run expand and migrate commands for the second time,
