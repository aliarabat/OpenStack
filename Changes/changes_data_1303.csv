Here we change a bit the way openstack clients for temporary users are created
by the system, so that they get created only if needed for the purposes of some
scenario. This helps to save running time as e.g. keystone clients require some
time to authenticate.

    Note, that in a class for work through Keystone Identity Service
    v2.0 keystone client is used as well as v3 keystone client.
    It's due to some functions are implemented in the only version of
    keystone client, e.g. users.check_in_group is implemented in v3
    version only and then we should use v3 keystone client, but
    there is no roles.roles_for_user or any analogs in v3 version,
    in v2.0 only, then we should use v2.0 version for checking
    user(other user, not user_id from context) is admin.
    This will be fixed when it's possible.

ACL implementation brings a mechanism of access permission management into
Cinder project. Currently there is only one type of volume access permission,
which is full access(The user can do any operations on the volume.).
If a volume is created by a user, it grants all access of this user and
the users with super authorizations, like administrators.
With ACL implementation, it is possible for different users to have different
levels of volume access permissions. ACL can differentiate users in terms of
granting different access permissions to volumes, which can establish
a foudation for sharing volumes, transferring volumes,
attaching multiple VM to a volume, etc.

Access permissions:

The owner of the volume and the administrators always have the full
access.
The owner, the administrators and the users with Read permission --
can read the permission of the volume.
The owner, the administrators and  the users with Write permission --
can edit the permission of the volume.
The owner and the administrators -- can give the volume access permission
to a group of users, users in a tenant, all users.
The user can check his own access permission to a specific volume.
The permissions of the administrators are unable to edit by any other user.
The permission of the creator can be modified by administrators only.

Access permission represents as an integer, which bits are mapped to:
1st (less significant) bit -- Read/Only attach;
2nd -- Read/Write attach;
3rd -- View Permissions;
4th -- Edit Permissions;
etc.

Where

Read: the user can only read the volume, including reading the content
	of the volume, the volume properties and the volume metadata.
Write: the user can read and write the volume. The user can do any operations
	on this volume, including all the API operations.
Permission Read: the user can read the permission list for this volume and
	be able to see who can access this volume with which permission level.
Permission Write: the user can read and edit the permission list for
	this volume and be able to see and edit who can access this volume
	with which permission level.

Implementation:

Part 1. DB
    Add a new table called VolumeACLPermission with columns:
    id - the primary key of the row;
    volume_id - indicates volume's ID;
    entity_id - indicates group or project ID which the permission
    affects or '*' keyword for everyone;
    type - ""project"" means entity_id is project_id; ""group"" means
    entity_id is group_id;
    access_permission - indicates access permission level. (as
    described in Access Permission above)

    Use cases:
    * The owner(user_id1) grants Read access to everyone. The
    corresponding record:
        {id: 2, volume_id: 'volume_id1', entity_id: '*', type:
        'project', access_permission: 1}
    * The owner(user_id1) grants Read+Permission Read access to all the users
    in a group(group_id1). The corresponding record:
        {id: 3, volume_id: 'volume_id1', entity_id: 'group_id1', type:
        'group', access_permission: 5}

Due to the fact that plugin port operations are not
transactional (as they involve non synchronized DB
and Controller operations), concurrent (interleaved)
port requests may accidentally cause the insertion
of the mapping entry (neutron-port-id, nvp-port-id)
more than once. In case this occurs, it's safe to
expect the failure and continue the normal process
of the operation being requested.

Due to different versions of MySQL it is possible to end up with
different FK's then what is expected. For example the FK constraint
on instance_info_caches changed from instance_info_caches_ibfk_1
to instance_info_caches_instance_uuid_fkey and on virtual_interfaces
from virtual_interfaces_ibfk_1 to
virtual_interfaces_instance_uuid_fkey meaning databases who have
upgraded from before folsom may have the old fkey.

This patch adds a check for those with the old fkey name to make sure
it is dropped before changing unique constraints (as is required by
MySQL). It also fixes the fkey name to be as defined in 133 if it
wasn't before (which will persist on downgrade being consistent with
those who have come in after folsom).

When enabling neutron service (i.e. enable_service q-xxx), related code
unconditionally adds a necessary plugin class to Q_SERVICE_PLUGIN_CLASSES.
Which may cause duplication in Q_SERVICE_PLUGIN_CLASSES when
Q_SERVICE_PLUGIN_CLASSES is explicitly specified in localrc.
As a result, neutron server fails to start.

This patch introduces a utility function to add service class,
and check duplication.

tox 1.6 was released, which means that we can now take advantage of
the feature we added to it - which is using setup.py develop to
install the code into the virtualenv. The logic was taken from
run_tests.sh - so the performance issues around using tox vs. using
install_venv should now be gone.

Additionally, override the tox pip install command to avoid using the
""--pre"" option which is the default in tox.  ""--pre"" means ""Include
pre-release and development versions.""  By default, pip will only
install stable versions of software, and that is the behavior we want.

Currently when using rbd as an image backend, nova downloads the
glance image to local disk and then copies it again into rbd.  This
can be very slow for large images, and wastes bandwidth as well as
disk space.

When the glance image is stored in the same ceph cluster, the data is
being pulled out and pushed back in unnecessarily. Instead, create a
copy-on-write clone of the image. This is a fast, and does not depend
on the size of the image. Instead of taking minutes, booting takes
seconds, and is not limited by the disk copy.

Add a direct_fetch() method to the image backend, so backends
like rbd can make optimizations like this. Try to use direct_fetch()
for the root disk when it comes from an image, but fall back to
fetch_to_raw() if direct_fetch() fails.

The majority of this code was taken from the cinder rbd driver.
The only new parts are the direct_fetch() method for the image
backend, and the small backwards-compatible interfaces changes
needed to make use of it.

AllocatedCapacityWeigher is a weigher that weigh hosts by their
allocated capacity. The main purpose of this weigher is to simulate
the SimpleScheduler's behavior, which sorts hosts by the size of
all volumes on them.  So by allocated capacity, it equals to the
sum of size of all volumes on target host.

In order to keep track of 'allocated' capacity, host state is updated
to add a 'allocated_capacity_gb' attribute to record the value, which
means each back-end must report one extra stats to scheduler.
Fortunately, the 'allocated' capacity we are interested in here is
pure Cinder level capacity, the volume manager can take all the burden
to calculate this value without having to query back-ends. The volume
manager does the initial calculation in init_host() by the time when it
has to query all existing volumes from DB for ensure_export(). After
initial calculation, volume manager/scheduler will keep track of every
new request that changes 'allocated_capacity' and make sure this value
is up to date.

!DriverImpact! Cinder driver developers, please read on:

This patch contains a change that might IMPACT volume drivers: volume
manager now uses 'stats' attribute to save 'allocated_capacity_gb'.
And this information will be merged with those stats drivers provide
as a whole for scheduler to consume.  If you plan to report any form
of allocated space other than the apparent Cinder level value, (e.g.
actual capacity allocated), Please choose a key name other than
'allocated_capacity_gb', otherwise it will *OVERWRITE* the value volume
manager has calculated and confuse scheduler.

Currently the entire QoS information (if any) is included in the result of
initialize_connection() even if the consumer of the QoS is 'back-end'. Also
the format for QoS specs also is changed so that front-end (Nova) can
parse correctly. Add unit test to cover initialize_connection().

Retry logic is now being used for both upload_vhd and download_vhd,
but nova/virt/xenapi/client/session.py still had 'upload_vhd'
hardcoded in its logged messages. This causes it to accept the
function being used as an argument, or use the more generic
'glance call' if the argument is not passed.

With these changes we can create new gates for checking the
repository api-site as well as the API site repositories:
doctest.py --force --check-build --api-site
doctest.py --check-niceness --api-site
doctest.py --check-syntax --api-site

This checks also wadl files for syntax and niceness.

Note that the other checks need further work. Also, --check-build
really needs --force to build everything since the dependency
generation does not handle the xml code of the repo yet.
The building only works on api-site yet, needs more work for the other
projects.

The functions validate_all_files and validate_individual_files have been
refactored to use one common function - thus removing some duplicated
code.

The idea of the patch is to avoid the combo value overwrite
when there is no ""direction"" value in the settings file.
This fixes the problem of always having and ""ingress""
direction, even when set manually by the combo.
If there it is a value for the direction in the
local_settings.py it is used.
The actual behavior is that always is setting direction
as ""ingress"" when choosing one of the ALL* rules
(ALL ICMP, ALL TCP and ALL UDP).

This commit provides the framework for the Savanna CLI. It is based on
the python-novaclient. novaclient was chosen because of its maturity
and the ubiquity in which it has been previously copied, i.e. we're in
the same boat as most everyone else. The goal is to keep modifications
in Savanna's copy to a minimum. To that end, much of the novaclient
code is retained, though commented out when it is not applicable.

A simple plugins-list/show command is provided with the framework for
demonstration and testing purposes.

There is wrapper create_volume() in base.py of volume tests, the method
creates a volume with 1GB size in default and registered the volume for
deleting it when tests finish.
However, the method is not used at many places and similar codes exist
for the same purpose.

This patch makes the volume tests use this wrapper create_volume() for
cleaning up. Some tests do not use wrapper create_volume() after applying
this patch, because these tests are for testing create_volume API and
it is better to call the API directly without wrapper method.

Post-mortem debugging, the ability to drop into a debugger with the
execution state that triggered the exception, is very useful in
diagnosing failure conditions.  Our previous test runner, nose,
provided the ability to enable post-mortem debugging on test
failures (via --pdb-failure) and errors (via --pdb).  testr
lacks these options at present, so this change adds support
for enabling post-mortem debugging via an environment variable.
All test-triggered exceptions will result in a post-mortem debugger
being invoked if OS_POST_MORTEM_DEBUG is set to ""1"" or ""True"".

The logic for the inject failure handling was incorrect, in that it
was treating injection of mandatory files as being a non-fatal error.

I've also moved the static class method to being just a normal method
because it was causing me testing errors once I fixed the error
reporting and I can't see a good reason for it to be a class method.

Until now, flavors were sorted by RAM, ascending, by default.

This patch introduces another way of using the
CREATE_INSTANCE_FLAVOR_SORT dict: by providing a flavor attribute.

The update of the floatingip_db was happening before the disassociation, so the
disassociation happened on new data. The old data was required to identify the
router_id. This fix changes the order of the disassociation and the
floatingip_db update. This fix has the side affect of fixing the tempest test
""test_floating_ips"" in the midonet plugin.

This change fixes the error that comes
while getting brick connector and attaching volumes
in case of NFS drivers in cinder. The attribute for
mount point base was not passed to attach_volume method
as the connector initialization logic is common for all
types of protocols. It is fixed by populating
the required parameter in the RemoteFsConnector
by extracting it from connection properties. The infrastructure
for fixing this situation for remote fs drivers is implemented
in this fix. The drivers need to override the method
_get_mount_point_base in their implementation. NFS driver
implements it. GlusterFs implementation of the method to follow
in a separate patch. Hence marking it partial fix.

Reasons:

1. If we change the value of CONF.mount_point it does not works,
because of too many wrong paths and hard-codings.
2. MYSQL_BASE_DIR is hard-coded as ""/var/lib/mysql"" and
over that has only 1 legitimate usage, when wiping logfiles.
3. No provision for updation of config_contents/my.cnf
if CONF.mount_point has a different value.
4. Initial data-files location to be backed up has been written
as CONF.mount_point which is no good when having different
value for CONF.mount_point.

Changes:
1. Initial data-file location updated as ""/var/lib/mysql"",
because thats where mysql creates its first datafiles; Logic is
if the location exists back it up.
2. Added code to update datadir in config_contents and my.cnf
when using a value other than ""/var/lib/mysql"" in CONF.mount_point.
3. Replaced MYSQL_BASE_DIR in wipe_ib_logfiles with CONF.mount_point,
because that is the place where we would have the log_files.

Quite a few people initially try OpenStack by running each node on
a virtual machine. In some cases, either the hypervisor and/or CPU
lack support for hardware acceleration required by KVM on the compute

support within the virtual machine and change 'libvirt_type' from KVM
to QEMU if the test fails.

""name all unit tests like test_<tested_module>.py"".

We also add a couple of new folders in unit tests so that the unit tests

This work is based on the Nova and Ironic objects code and introduces an
object type registry mapping interfaces to implementations, common
primitive hydration, and explicit field declaration with type coercion
between primitive formats to python formats.

Imported nova/objects/base.py and nova/objects/fields.py from nova commit
93efad46aa1cbb9aef68561aca49278ef7584983.

* Renamed Object to DomainObject for better clarity
* Split metataclass behavior and core methods, added register_obj_class(),
  reset_obj_classes(), and obj_class_for_name() to allow easier subclassing
  by complex objects.
* Removed RPC logic (will replace the @remotable syntax with oslo.messaging
  as necessary)
* Removed Nova specific field types

The base code here is now easier to use with subclasses (allowing a consumer
to load and register their own implementations of the base classes)

Moved from https://review.openstack.org/57022 on request to enable shared
use.

Downgrading the cinder schema fails when running 018_add_qos_specs.py

Stable branch overrides for client testing, devstack-gate alternate-branch
testing, and grenade old/new branch selection are all actually the same
thing.  Update setup_project to reflect that, fixing all known bugs in
the process.  Note that some jobs will need to be updated to pass in
OVERRIDE_ZUUL_BRANCH.

This is an update to the previously reverted change to add testing and a fix
for an issue seen in production.  The resulting code is actually simpler, but
it is worth noting that the check to ensure that at some point the ZUUL_REF
for the project was checked out has been removed.

exceptions while doing that.  Currently exceptions can bubble up to volume
API not being handled.  This patch logs exception in volume manager and
then raises VolumeBackendAPIException to caller.

When creating a new volume from a qcow2 image stored in glance, we will
be given the physical size of the image instead of the virtual size.
Most drivers will convert that image to raw after downloading for
resizing it to the requested volume size afterwards.

If the virtual size of the image is bigger than the requested one, the
resulting volume might end up being unusable after the resize even
though the creation went good.

This patch will make the volume creation fail if the virtual size of
the image exceeds the one of the requested volume.

1. oozie-setup.sh exists with status code 0 when error occurs.
2. Savanna expects that HDFS is running immediately

This patch addresses the second issue.
The first issue is addressed by https://review.openstack.org/#/c/62511/

Added check that all datanodes are running before manipulations with HDFS.

tox 1.6 was released, which means that we can now take advantage of
the feature we added to it - which is using setup.py develop to
install the code into the virtualenv. The logic was taken from
run_tests.sh - so the performance issues around using tox vs. using
install_venv should now be gone.

Additionally, override the tox pip install command to avoid using the
""--pre"" option which is the default in tox.  ""--pre"" means ""Include
pre-release and development versions.""  By default, pip will only
install stable versions of software, and that is the behavior we want.

Currently Glance v1 allows creation of images with negative sizes when
the source URL provided by the --location parmeter does not exist at
the time of creation.

There is already a check to verify whether or not an image size can be
converted to an int but the check doesn't verify whether or not the
resulting value is >= 0. This commit supplements that check to
disallow negative values for the size parameter.

This is a hard coded proof of concept of a rolling upgrade test for
nova-compute.  Nova wants to support the ability to run stable/havana
nova-compute with icehouse everything else. This sets up a test for
that.

Full support for this will come in a separate series of patches. This is
to just show the idea.

From the mysql docs:

Make MySQL behave like a ""traditional"" SQL database system.
A simple description of this mode is ""give an error instead
of a warning"" when inserting an incorrect value into a column.

In the current implementation, when we boot a server we can
provide additional placement information through the scheduler
hints mechanism. However, when we live migrate a server those
scheduler hints are not taken into account.

This patch adds the ability to check if the target host passes
filters before live migration. To achieve that task those
hints are persisted as a json blob into the database.

This additional verification can leave the system locked, for
instance two hosts which run servers that must be located on
different hosts can't be migrated. Thus, an option
'no-check-by-scheduler' has been set up in order to make this
verification optional.

This test case is pretty raw, but it does make some invalid
assumptions about using the first hypervisor for everything. In
the uptime case it really needs to loop over all of them otherwise
if the first hypervisor is disabled this will fail.

This also does a cleanup refactoring of the hypervisor list check.

In the current Neutron Havana packages for RHEL-style distributions,
the default 'root_helper' key in neutron.conf references 'quantum'
instead of 'neutron'. This issue should get fixed upstream, but in
the meantime I added a step to make sure this key references
'neutron'.

I fixed the AMQP configuration steps in cinder.conf for Block Storage
on both controller and service nodes. I also unified structure and
phrasing with other portions of the guide and mentioned replacing
'RABBIT_PASS'. This patch affects all distributions.

I also found and fixed a minor issue causing several database
configuration instructions for other distributions to leak into those
for Debian which uses Debconf.

This change set moves the negative tests in test_virtual_interfaces to
a new file test_virtual_interfaces_negative

Also changes line # 43, rand_name(#$%*&^%) to uuid4() to get the invalid
server ID in negative file and removes usage of modules directly.

Note: HACKING.rst
The second requirement is that all negative tests must be added to a negative
test file. If such a file doesn't exist for the particular resource being
tested a new test file should be added
