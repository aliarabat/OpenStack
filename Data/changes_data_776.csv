TIL:

  Similarly, all the END rules are merged, and executed when all the
  input is exhausted (or when an exit statement is executed).

i.e. matching YUM_FAILED calls ""exit"", which falls through to the END
rules which calls ""exit result"" ... which is zero.  i.e. if the return
code is 1 then we actually hide that and return with zero.

This is rather annoying because errors that should halt to alert us of
a package install failure pass through, only for you to have to debug
much later on seemingly unrelated problems.

This always sets ""result"" and thus should be returning the right
thing.  I've updated the documentation to hopefully make it clearer
what's going on.

Protected needs to be bool - but other values need to get cast to
string. There's no good way other than enumerating them like we did for
the other values.

There are two ways to pass in user-defined settings - via the meta param
which does not get cast to anything else and assumes the values are in
the correct type, and **kwargs which does its best to cast.

We know about protected. We can add others if needed (although the

As part of the first community-wide goal [1], teams were asked
to remove the openstack/common package of their projects
if one existed. This was a byproduct of the old oslo-incubator
form of syncing common functionality.

The package, apiclient, was moved to a top level location
and cliutils was moved to the common module. There are no oslo
specific libraries, the recommended solution is to move it
in tree and maintain it there.

Specifically in this patch, I also rearranged some of the
imports to make them match up with the hacking guidelines
while I was re-ordering them for the refactor anyway.

Lastly, the apiclient/fake_client.py was deleted since it
was not used.

Move dib-run-parts from dib-utils into diskimage-builder directly.

For calling outside the chroot, we provide a standard entry-point
script.  However, as noted in the warning comment, the underlying
script is still copied directly into the chroot by the dib-run-parts
element.  I believe this to be the KISS approach.

This removes the dependency on dib-utils.  We have discussed this
previously and nobody seemed to think retiring dib-utils was going to
be an issue.

This also updates the documentation to not mention dib-utils, or using
disk-image-create via $PATH setup, but rather gives instructions on
installing from pip with a virtualenv.

REBASING: Still broken

Instad of revoking upon Project deactivat ion and so on
this does a live check upon token validation.

Some of the role apis are a little more forgiving.

If a user loses a role, it is ipoosible that the token will
still validate, just with a lesser set of roles.  However,
if the role removed is the last role, the tokek will still
be invalid.

Trustee pass word change no longer invalidates a token. It
never should have, as the Trustee is not involved during
trust execution.

This is an in-repo tempest plugin i.e. the plugin resides inside the swift repo
and requires to install swift inorder to install the plugin.

Directory Structre:
The tempest plugin that resides at swift/test/tempest/ uses a symbolic link
to functional tests that reside at swift/test/functional. By this, we eliminate
the possibility of probe and unit tests also get discovered when the top level
diretory of the tests i.e. swift/test is passed to test_discovery module.
Further, we keep the path to Swift's functional tests intact and let them be
invoked normally using testr from the swift root diretory.

Alternatively, we can move the functional tests to under the tempest test to
avoid creation of symlink. In this case, we have to update the import paths of
all the functional tests and their path in testr config.

Current implementation does not include any additional configurations for
enabling tempest to invoke and successfully run Swift's functional tests. If
there is a need to add more config options apart from what is offered in
tempest.conf, we need to create a config.py under swift/test/tempest and pass
its object to the functional tests. Currently, the user credentials for running
functional tests are picked up from /etc/swift/test.conf

Moves the creation of the dummy overcloud-full image from deploy.sh into
tripleo.sh. As this step has to be performed when using multinode setups
for dev/test, it makes more sense to be in tripleo.sh for re-usability.

The dummy image is needed because there is no way to disable the image
constraint in tripleo-heat-templates when using multinode setups without
removing the constraint entirely (which we may eventually need to do).

It's added to the --boostrap-subnodes option as it reasons that if you
are bootstrapping subnodes, you likely need a dummy image in glance. If
a real image already exists, then this step is skipped.

Currently the ec2 collector polls the nova metadata service every
$polling_period even though the data is not expected to change and no
known config actions have been written to respond to changes in these
values.

With larger overclouds, this metadata polling will cause noticeable
load on the undercloud, especially nova-api and neutron (for port
lookups).

This change will check for data in /var/lib/os-collect-config/ec2.json
and simply return that if it exists.

As stated on the pathlib website that package is no longer
maintained and since pathlib is now in the std lib it is
appropriate to have a backport of that std lib version for
general usage in version of python that are older 3.4

This library provides that backport so that projects can
use the newer libraries features and more easily transtion
to the native python 3.4 (and newer) version when they are
able.

Link: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pathlib2

Is the library actively maintained?

It is a backport that seems to be updated recently.

Is the library good code?

Just a backport so only really as good as the one built
into python itself.

Is the library python 3 compatible?

Yes.

Is the library license compatible?

Yes.

Is the library already packaged in the distros we target?

Seems to already be in ubuntu, unsure if its fedora.

Is the function of this library already covered by other
libraries in global-requirements.txt?

Nope.

Is the library required for OpenStack project or related
dev or infrastructure setup?

I plan on transitioning kolla to using it (other projects
that do path routines or things with os.walk or os.path should
likely also move to it).

We currently don't store requested security groups with the instance
(or build request) when using neutron, but we plan on doing that as
part of the cells v2 scheduling interaction and moving the instance
create to conductor. The plan is to store the SecurityGroupList
in the request spec so we can lookup the requested security groups
again later.

In order to avoid a situation where the name changes on a security
group in neutron, we need to store the uuid which is immutable. So
this change transforms any requested security group names to uuids
when using neutron as if the user had only requested uuids.

Nothing is using this yet as populate_security_groups in the
neutron security group driver is basically a no-op, but later
changes will rely on this when storing the security groups in the
request spec.

This patch makes L3 HA failover not depended on neutron components
(during failover).

All HA agents(active and backup) call update_device_up/down after wiring
the ports. But l2pop driver is called for only active agent as port
binding in DB reflects active agent. Then l2pop creates unicast and
multicast flows for active agent.
On failover, flows to new active agent is created. For this to happen -
all of database, messaging server, neutron-server and destination L3
agent should be active during failover. This creates two issues -
1) When any of the above resources(i.e neutron-server, .. ) are dead,
   flows between new master and other agents won't be created and
   L3 Ha failover is not working. In same scenario, L3 Ha failover will
   work if l2pop is disabled.
2) Packet loss during failover is higher as above neutron resources
   interact multiple times, so will take time to create l2 flows.

In this change, we allow plugin to notify l2pop when update_device_up/down
is called by backup agents also. Then l2pop will create flood flows to
all HA agents(both active and slave). L2pop won't create unicast flow for
this port, instead unicast flow is created by learning action of table 10
when keepalived sends GARP after assigning ip address to master router's
qr-xx port. As flood flows are already created and unicast flow is
dynamically added, L3 HA failover is not depended on l2pop.

This solves two isses
1) with L3 HA + l2pop, failover will work even if any of above agents
   or processes dead.
2) Reduce failover time as we are not depending on neutron to create
   flows during failover.
We use L3HARouterAgentPortBinding table for getting all HA agents of a
router port. HA router port on slave agent is also considered for l2pop
distributed_active_network_ports and agent_network_active_port_count

When using the metadata URL to do the ec2 auth request, req.params
was being used to fetch the auth-related parameters that would have
been passed to keystone. Problem is, this value will get both the
query parameters and the values in the POST body of the request; when
in reality we only care about the query parameters. Getting extra
values (besides the query parameters) could cause the signature
validation to give a wrong value.

This, then, uses a more appropriate value from the Request class,
which is GET. This value contains the actual query parameters, and
won't get any undesired values to the auth_params.

Currently get_rpc_server is a convenience function that allows
consumers of oslo_messaging.rpc to instantiate an RPCServer. It does
this by constructing a default dispatcher and using that to construct
the RPCServer.

There are situations where consumers of oslo_messaging.rpc can benefit
from having access to the message that is received and manipulate it
before the RPC call is made. One example of this is message signing
and verification. While this can be accomplished with a decorator or
hook on each RPC method, having a dispatcher that can inspect the
message, verify it (assuming that the client did some corresponding
signing and stuck a signature argument into kwargs) and then invoke
the default RPCDispatcher's dispatch method.

This change allows such a requestor to provide a dispatcher to
get_rpc_server. It is assumed that this dispatcher will be one that
derives from RPCDispatcher or at least provides the same methods.

In the use-case that drives this change request, trove would provide a
dispatcher that derives from RPCDispatcher, and use its dispatch()
method merely to verify the message signature before popping that
signature argument from the kwargs and invoking the
RPCDispatcher.dispatch method.

Trove could just as well make its own get_rpc_server convenience
method and do what it wishes to there but I think it would be better
to do it this way as it makes it apparent to people who come later
that the ability to override the dispatcher in this manner is
something that is in fact being done, and something that is an
understood use-case.

Put differntly, this is the non-decorator based approach to do
something similar to the sample that I illustrated in
https://gist.github.com/amrith/6a89ff478f81c2910e84325923eddebe and
sileht proposed in http://paste.openstack.org/show/588244/.

When the resource tracker creates Inventory in the placement

Until commit I18596a3c0f2b0049aaccd0f3e73aef90b684c4a8 the
min_unit,max_unit and step_size constraints on Inventory were
not being checked when making Allocations. When that
enforcement merges, the resource tracker will no longer be
able to make allocations of anything other than unit 1.

This patch tries to fix the above stated problem by changing
the value of max_unit to reflect the real limits on the machine

This patch is adding a new method called count_msdos_partitions()
responsible for counting the number of primary and logical partitions
in a MBR partition table.

Prior to this patch, the code checking if there were more than 4 primary
partitions present in the partiton table was using the list_partitions()
method which do not distinguish between the types*. So, even if the disk
had 2 primary and 5 logical partitions the check would fail thinking
that 7 primary partitions were present (which is impossible btw).

This patch make use of ""partprobe"" to count the partitions, which is
already required in ironic-lib.

* Not distinguishing types is a pro on the list_partitions() method
because primary and logical does not apply for others disk labels such
as GPT.

This patch also fix a small typo in a non-related string :-)

to change the JSON structure of the inventory ""records"" to this:

        ...

However, we forgot to make the PUT /r-p/{uuid}/inventories request
consistent with the GET response payload.

This corrects that oversight. The code in the placement API was written
to the spec and will need to be corrected as well.

This patch also update some related testcases to make sure

logic from endpoint filter extension has the constraint and
this is make sense to inherent into SQL backend as well.

The original idea of enginefacade was that applications
would call upon the global _TransactionContextManager
given in oslo_db.sqlalchemy.enginefacade.  However, as it
turns out, virtually no Openstack projects seem to be
using that technique, and instead, everyone is creating
their own ad-hoc _TransactionContextManager objects
and usually establishing it as a module-level global.
Nova has two of them.

Additionally, projects add configuration to these
enginefacades (which IS part of the original idea), and
this configuration in some cases is necessary to be present
for tests that run as well, a key example being the
sqlite_fks flag.   The original DbFixture integration
provided no way of reusing this configuration.

Finally, projects very much tend to use custom fixtures
in order to define their database communication.
Test classes themselves don't really make use of
oslo_db's DbTestCase anymore.

This patch introduces a modernized fixture system
which, in conjunction with the recent provisioning
patch, addresses these use cases.   Applications will typically
create their own subclasses of these fixtures up front
to suit the various testing cases they have, including
SQLite fixed, SQLite ad-hoc, and opportunistic.

In order to accommodate the fixture-based flow
along with the use of testresources for opportunistic
database provisioning, a mixin class OpportunisticDbTestMixin
is still needed when a test needs to use ""opportunistic""
testing in order to provide the .resources attribute.
The calculation of .resources is moved into the fixture
system, but because this attribute is consulted before
setUp(), the ""opportunistic"" fixture must be created
early and stored.

The library is a relatively simple extension for the Sphinx
documentation system already in use for OpenStack documentation
generation.

It enables a combination of the global table-of-contents and local
table-of-contents to appear in the sidebar of the generated
documentation making it easier to navigate docs by providing access to
all other top level topics in the sidebar when on any page, rather than
forcing the user to go back to the top level index each time.
While it's not actively changing, there also doesn't appear to be much
need for it to be modified as it currently works for the common use
cases expected.

Lacks tests, however is sufficiently small in amount of code that it
seems to be relatively straight forward to test.

It is python 3 compatible.

The license (Apache 2.0) is compatible.

It is not packaged by common distros, however it's not required to be
able to run, and is only needed when generating documentation.

There is nothing else providing this capability in global-requirements.

This library will be used for docs building by git-upstream.

The iLO drivers try to set boot mode to UEFI when they detect UEFI-capable hardware.
This can be surprising for operators, as it's not consistent with other drivers.
Also, UEFI support in TripleO is somewhat less mature.

Change the default boot mode to ""bios"" via puppet. Operators can still change
the boot mode per node by setting an appropriate capability.

is local or catch all by doing a match against

            LOCAL_ADDRS = ('0.0.0.0', '127.0.0.1', '::', '::1')

In IPv6, due to zero compression, there are many different valid ways
to represent :: and ::1 (since leading zeros don't need to be suppressed).

Because of this, the current code will fail to match against something
like ""::0"" even though it's a perfectly valid way to represent the
same address.

The simple fix for this is to convert the address(es) in the config file
to canonical form before matching against LOCAL_ADDRS.

In this changeset, I added the ""goal"" and the ""strategy ""ObjectField
which can either be loaded by setting the new ""eager"" parameter as True
or not loaded (as before) by setting it to False.
The advantage of introducing this eager parameter is that this way,
we can reduce to a minimum the overhead of DB queries whenever the
related goal is not actually needed.

Changing ""Create New Volume"" option from Yes to No and opposite should invoke
calling updateFlavorFacades() and validateFlavor() to recalculate the errors.
Otherwise user can select ""Yes, create new volume"", select the flavour with
root_disk < min_disk and later change his mind to ""No, don't create new
volume"". Without recalculating errors, this behaviour would be allowed whereas
it shouldn't be.

This commit introduces ref(templateName [, parameterName] [, idOnly])
YAQL function was added to UI definition DSL. This function evaluates
template templateName and fixes the result in parameters under
parameterName key (or templateName if the second parameter was omitted).
Then it generates object ID and places it into ?/id field. On the first
use of parameterName or if idOnly is false the function will return
the whole object structure. On subsequent calls or if idOnly is true it
will return the ID that was generated upon the first call.
Thus the function brings ability to reference single object several
times.

ID generation is done in a safe way with a special temporary type that
wraps string ID and replaced with string representation upon
serialization. This way it is still impossible for a developer to
explicitly provide ID value in the template (it is still going to be
overwritten because it is not of an ObjectID type and it is impossible
to create instance of ObjectID from yaql expression)

This is a hackish way to ensure that keepalived is restarted during the
next phase in order to have the ip recreated.

It basically adds a comment line to the keepalived.conf file (making it
different than the puppet one) if it's there. This will force a puppet
restart of the keepalive service puting the ips back on the undercloud.

Currently when tripleo runs, puppet output is captured and printed
to the log in a batch at the end of the puppet run. This means
all timestamps are gone, which can make debugging more difficult
as it is not clear which resources are handled at which time,
particularly across multiple nodes.

This is addressed by logging to both the console and syslog directly.
While this will result in duplicate log entries as both the batched
and individual lines end up in syslog, it preseves the current
behavior that allows heat to output the puppet output, as well as
providing the output to the logging system.

As part of the first community-wide goal [1], teams were asked
to remove the openstack/common package of their projects
if one existed. This was a byproduct of the old oslo-incubator
form of syncing common functionality.

- Most of the apiclient package was not actually used in code,
  only the exceptions were. So remove most of it.
- Copy the exceptions from apiclient to an existing top level
  location.
- Create an i18n module to remove the gettextutils dependency,
  this creates a new requirement - oslo.i18n.
- Remove a test (test_base) since it was testing the
  functionality of apiclient.base, which was not used in
  congressclient.
- General cleanup to other openstack/common references

Due to the way caching is disabled the SHOULD_CACHE_FN() is used
to determine if new values are stored in the cache backend, and is
only called when the regeneration is required. If dogpile is
configured to connect to a memcache, redis, etc to store data
it is possible with caching disabled to still pull values from
the cache (SHOULD_CACHE_FN has no bearing on reads).

The issue described only impacts the use of the memoization
decorator.

This change forces dogpile to use the null backend if caching is
globally disabled to ensure no data is read from the external
cache. This will not affect subsystem disabling of cache.

Even with cache disabled but reads coming from the external cache,
there stale data is not a concern as invalidates will still be
processed and the data from the backend will eventually timeout
in most cases.

teardown_neutron_debug. Recently a change to devstack-gate

triggered and breaking the gate-devstack-dsvm-updown job.

and teardown_neutron_debug.

This patch adds tasks and docs for RHEL-07-030331, which encrypts audit
logs as they are transmitted across the network.  Kerberos must be
configured in advance (this is noted in the documentation).

When we make a keystoneauth Session instance we are not looking at domain
info. This way we're always creating v2Password auth plugin, which will
obviously fail in an Identity v3-only scenario.

This patch makes domain information (i.e user_domain_id and project_domain_id)
be read from the context so that we can issue v3Password plugin as well.

Also, the logic behind auth plugin creation has been changed, as long as the
loading mechanism is designed to read options from config files, which is not
the case. Creating the plugin directly seems to fit better here.

This change is backwards compatible, since identity.Password can figure
out what Identity version is in use and will ignore domain info if v2.0

So ovs-native jobs are unnecessary in master.
But a test case which doesn't use default as ovs-interface(vsctl and ovs-ofctl)
still needs to be checked.
This allows to run the test case with non-default ovs-interface on all

Solves a bug that can brake the periodic task execution in
oneview drivers. The problem occurs when the method to check
if a node is in use by oneview raise an exception.

When that happens, the periodic task will break its execution,
leaving the node with a wrong provision state and wrong
maintenance mode too. The expected behavior when this occurs
is skip processing the current node, iterate over the next
node and process it.

This patch changes the periodic task execution flow, ignoring
the exception and processing the next node. In the next
periodic task execution, the not processed node can be
processed and updated accordingly.

an unreadable ID of the user, instead of the user name. However,
getting the name of the user for every row could prove expensive.
Therefore, I'm turning the ID into a link to the user details page,

To be able to support multiple hosts working with the same resources we
have added the workers table to keep track of which host is working with
each specific resource.

This patch makes c-vol service work with this new table by adding
entries on cleanable operations and removing them once these operations
have completed.

Service cleanup on initialization has also been changed to use this new
table so hosts will cleanup only resources from operations they left on
the air and leave any operations that are being processed by other
hosts.

In order to facilitate a future extraction of the placement service
we want to record the association between a resource provider and an
arbitrary aggregate uuid in its own table.

A PlacementAggregate model is joined from ResourceProvider via
ResourceProviderAggregate. Note that this structure is used so we can
join on ids instead of strings (the uuids). A direct mapping between
ResourceProvider uuid and Aggregate uuid was mooted earlier in the year
but was determined to be suboptimal.

The name 'placement_aggregates' is used as the least problematic of
several choices after discussion amongst several parties.

The data will be used by the forthcoming get_ and set_aggregates
methods on the ResourceProvider object.

We rely on keepalived to send gratuitous ARPs when floating IP is added.
Older versions of keepalived up to 1.2.20 (exclusive) contain bug [1] where
keepalived does not send GARP on receiving SIGHUP. Unfortunately, newer
versions containing the fix are not packaged yet for some distributions
like RHEL or CentOS or Ubuntu Xenial, so this patch adds a workaround for
such distributions until new packages are available.

The patch also sets net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind kernel parameter to 0 for
Snat and HA router namespaces in order to avoid sending gratuitous ARPs
for IP addresses that are not bound to the interface anymore - possibly
because of failover or removal. Note that kernel < 3.19 contain a bug
where this knob is missing. In case it attempts to set the parameter and
it's missing on the system, it doesn't set the knob in root
namespace like it's done for fip namespaces, but only issues a warning
message.

This passes the MTU from the network_info into the
constructed os-vif object so it can be used by the
os-vif plugging libraries to set the correct MTU.

Now with os-vif >=1.3.0 in the global requirements,
os-vif has correct support for MTUs on the os-vif
objects so we can use them correctly.

The follow-up patch removes the MTU hacks that were
added last minute for the related bug.
