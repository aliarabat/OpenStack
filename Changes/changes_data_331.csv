iDRAC driver complains and fails about SpanLength during RAID provisioning.

The reason is because Ironic returns a float instead of an int and iDRAC
doesn't like that.

Value returns should not be 2.0 for 2 for example.

This solves the problem that bootstrap_nodeid, which is set to the
first node in each role via t-h-t, can match potentially more than
one node - e.g in the event that a service is deployed such that it
spans more than one role.

The SERVICE_short_bootstrap_node_name is automatically generated
based on the composable service template service_name, and this
considers all roles where the service is enabled, e.g it should
only evaluate true once regardles off the roles where the service
is enabled.

In Python 3, dict.values() method returns a view of the dictionary's
values but in a different order than Python 2, which returns a
list. This patch sorts the data dictionary first to be sure to get the
same order whatever the Python version.

In Python 3.3 ""abstract base classes"" in collections (like Mapping or
Sequence) were moved to second-level module collections.abc. So in
Python 3.3+ the real type is collections.abc.Mapping and so
on. Documentation states that the old alias
names (e.g. collections.Mapping) will be available up to Python
3.7 (currently the latest version), however in 3.8 these aliases will be
removed. This patch prepares the code to the future Python 3.8 version.

This patch also fixes the warnings and errors lists to get only unique
messages.

multiplying that by the defined percentage of total data expected

byte quota on each pool that is equal to its expected percentage
of the total cluster quota.

still short enough to detect when the DHCP agent is dead during the

matter of specifying --os-compute-api-version 2.21 or higher

This solves the problem that bootstrap_nodeid, which is set to the
first node in each role via t-h-t, can match potentially more than
one node - e.g in the event that a service is deployed such that it
spans more than one role.

The SERVICE_short_bootstrap_node_name is automatically generated
based on the composable service template service_name, and this
considers all roles where the service is enabled, e.g it should
only evaluate true once regardles off the roles where the service
is enabled.

This patch ports the tempurl middleware over to PY3. We use
an ""all-native"" string model, where we convert WSGI strings
as soon as we see them. It helps to deal with HMAC.

Aaand, we fix formpost along the way. It _clearly_ was
doing a wrong thing, encoding the same body several times
if we had several keys. On py2 it wasn't noticeable, but
on py3 this breaks, because the bytes type cannot be encoded
again.

In Python 3, dict.values() method returns a view of the dictionary's
values but in a different order than Python 2, which returns a
list. This patch sorts the data dictionary first to be sure to get the
same order whatever the Python version.

In Python 3.3 ""abstract base classes"" in collections (like Mapping or
Sequence) were moved to second-level module collections.abc. So in
Python 3.3+ the real type is collections.abc.Mapping and so
on. Documentation states that the old alias
names (e.g. collections.Mapping) will be available up to Python
3.7 (currently the latest version), however in 3.8 these aliases will be
removed. This patch prepares the code to the future Python 3.8 version.

This patch also fixes the warnings and errors lists to get only unique
messages.

If cascade=True, we're getting all of the instances on the
compute node just to use the uuid, which will by default
join on the info_cache and security_groups for the instances.
This is a simple optimization to avoid those unnecessary joins.

A TODO is left to further optimize this with a new InstanceList
query method to just get the instance uuids on a given host/node
combo, but that requires an RPC change which we can't backport.

This allows plugins to specify their binary dependencies in bindep
format.

Some thinking on the implementation: this is in contrast to the
files/[deb|rpm] installation, which is called from the external
install_prereqs.sh script.  This script being an externally callable
entry-point is really an artifact of the days when we would build
snapshot images for CI and wanted to pre-cache downloads.  These days
we use the mirror system to keep packages close to CI nodes.  Thus
rather than expand install_prereqs.sh to also be installing
virtualenvs and python dependencies, this seems to fit better as a
separate internal phase of stack.sh.

Documentation is updated

This commit makes the preparations necessary to track inventory for
the new MEM_ENCRYPTION_CONTEXT resource class, which was added in
os-resource-classes 0.4.0, and represents the number of guests a
compute node can host concurrently with memory encrypted at the
hardware level.

Initially this is required because on AMD SEV-capable hardware, the
memory controller has a fixed number of slots for holding encryption
keys, one per guest.  Typical hardware only has 15 slots, thereby
limiting the number of SEV guests which can be run concurrently to 15.
nova needs to track how many slots are available and used in order to
avoid attempting to exceeding that limit in the hardware.

Work is in progress to allow QEMU and libvirt to expose the number of
slots available on SEV hardware; however until this is finished and
released, it will not be possible for nova to programatically detect
the correct value with which to populate the MEM_ENCRYPTION_CONTEXT
inventory.

So add a new CONF.libvirt.num_memory_encrypted_guests configuration
option as a stop-gap, allowing the cloud operator to provide this
value manually.

A follow-up commit will use the value of this configuration option to
populate the inventory.  That commit will be the final ""switch""
enabling all AMD SEV functionality in one go.  However
os-resource-classes is bumped to 0.4.0 here to facilitate advance
preparation and testing.

The join() in get_router_for_floatingip() is joining from entity
to entity without an explicit ON clause which creates an ambiguous
situation. SQLAlchemy 1.3 guards against this now, so use the
real relationship-bound path so that the ORM does not need to guess.

This mock replicates the original query without the
""gw_port.device_owner == DEVICE_OWNER_ROUTER_GW"" filter.

At the PTG, CERN pointed out that placement is slower when
the number of resource providers gets very large, so I thought
it would be useful to adjust perfload to 10,000 providers.

This is simply a ""let's see what that looks like"". As such
other jobs in .zuul.yaml are turned off in check, with a
few left as a guard in gate.

A new version of placeload is required to properly manage
concurrency while creating resource providers.

In the case that multitenancy_enabled is false, the CIFS tests fail,
first because the auxiliary access function returns None, which means
the access object cannot be used by the caller, and second because if a
floating IP address isn't chosen explicitly as the share point, the
server's fixed IP may be chosen which is not in the same segment as the
share server, which means the share will not be accessible. This patch
fixes both issues by making the auxiliary access granting function
consistent for both NFS and CIFS and differentiating instead on
multitenancy_enabled.

We can only have one single bootstrap_nodeid per deployment, and if we

To prevent that, we can use the primary_role_name variable which is the
name of role which has both 'controller' & 'primary' tags in it.

Before that, we were building bootstrap_nodeid by using the first node
in the role; which can be problematic if for example we have multiple
roles for 'controller' tags.

It is possible to cold migrate a stopped server. If, however, the
cold migrate is scheduled to the instance's current host and the
compute driver does not support cold migrating to the same host,
then UnableToMigrateToSelf was being raised from _prep_resize. If
_reschedule_resize_or_reraise re-raises that exception, then
_error_out_instance_on_exception in prep_resize handles it and
sets the instance vm_state to ACTIVE. This is wrong since the
instance power state is unchanged at this point and the instance
is actually stopped.

This fixes the problem by wrapping UnableToMigrateToSelf in
InstanceFaultRollback and raises that from _prep_resize, and
_error_out_instance_on_exception is called with the initial
vm_state (STOPPED in this case) so when _error_out_instance_on_exception
handles the InstanceFaultRollback exception it sets the instance
vm_state to STOPPED (what it already was) rather than ACTIVE.

There were no existing unit tests for the UnableToMigrateToSelf

For some reason, only NotImplementedError in _error_out_instance_on_exception
would use the $instance_state parameter which can be controlled by the
caller of the context manager to determine the rollback vm_state. But in the
case of InstanceFaultRollback, the caller may want to reset the vm_state
back to something other than ACTIVE, like if the instance is actually
STOPPED and something like prep_resize fails (you can resize a STOPPED
instance).

This change makes _error_out_instance_on_exception handle InstanceFaultRollback
like NotImplementedError in that the instance_state parameter is used to reset
the instance.vm_state. It also adds a docstring explaining how this context
manager works along with some notes/questions about ways to improve it.

When the RabbitMQ experience a rolling restart of its peers, the
master of an HA queue fails over from one replica to another.

If there are messages sent to the HA queue while some rabbit
nodes are restarting, the latter will reconnect as unsynchronized
slaves. It can happen that during a rolling restart, all rabbit
nodes reconnect as unsynchronized, which prevents RabbitMQ to
automatically elect a new Master for failover. This has other
side effects on fanout queues and may prevent OpenStack
notification to be consumed properly.

Change the HA policy to always allow a promotion even when all
replicas are unsynchronized. When such rare condition happens,
rely on OpenStack client to retry RPC if they need to.

Right now every controller rotates fernet keys. This is nice because
should any controller die, we know the remaining ones will rotate the
keys. However, we are currently over-rotating the keys.

When we over rotate keys, we get logs like this:

 This is not a recognized Fernet token <token> TokenNotFound

Most clients can recover and get a new token, but some clients (like
Nova passing tokens to other services) can't do that because it doesn't
have the password to regenerate a new token.

With three controllers, in crontab in keystone-fernet we see the once a day
correctly staggered across the three controllers:

ssh ctrl1 sudo cat /etc/kolla/keystone-fernet/crontab
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/fernet-rotate.sh
ssh ctrl2 sudo cat /etc/kolla/keystone-fernet/crontab
0 8 * * * /usr/bin/fernet-rotate.sh
ssh ctrl3 sudo cat /etc/kolla/keystone-fernet/crontab
0 16 * * * /usr/bin/fernet-rotate.sh

Currently with three controllers we have this keystone config:

[token]
expiration = 86400 (although, keystone default is one hour)
allow_expired_window = 172800 (this is the keystone default)

[fernet_tokens]
max_active_keys = 4

Currently, kolla-ansible configures key rotation according to the following:

   rotation_interval = token_expiration / num_hosts

This means we rotate keys more quickly the more hosts we have, which doesn't
make much sense.

Keystone docs state:

   max_active_keys =
     ((token_expiration + allow_expired_window) / rotation_interval) + 2

For details see:
https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/stein/admin/fernet-token-faq.html

Rotation is based on pushing out a staging key, so should any server
start using that key, other servers will consider that valid. Then each
server in turn starts using the staging key, each in term demoting the
existing primary key to a secondary key. Eventually you prune the
secondary keys when there is no token in the wild that would need to be
decrypted using that key. So this all makes sense.

This change adds new variables for fernet_token_allow_expired_window and
fernet_key_rotation_interval, so that we can correctly calculate the
correct number of active keys. We now set the default rotation interval
so as to minimise the number of active keys to 3 - one primary, one
secondary, one buffer.

This change also fixes the fernet cron job generator, which was broken
in the following cases:

* requesting an interval of more than 1 day resulted in no jobs
* requesting an interval of more than 60 minutes, unless an exact
  multiple of 60 minutes, resulted in no jobs

It should now be possible to request any interval up to a week divided
by the number of hosts.

Horizon is relying on Django app registry to manage its plugins.
Django, in turn, is using Horizon's setting util to load
the app configurations.

https://github.com/openstack/horizon/blob/master/openstack_dashboard
/utils/settings.py

It basically uses pkgutil to load any kind of Python files under the
openstack_dashboard/enabled dir. However, if the package does not cleanup
its compiled Python files (i.e. pyc and pyo), it will lead to problems
during upgrade where the new package is using the same app lable that is
occupied by an old pyc/pyo file that got left behind. Therefore, sensible
thing to do would be to cleanup those old pyc/pyo files prior to running
manage.py.

Some tests compare timestamps (e.g. image created_at/updated_at
fields).

In some cases, subsequent timestamps may be identical, breaking the
assertions made by those tests.

One idea is to just add a 1ms sleep which should be a negligeable.
Mocking the functions used to retrieve timestamps may be undesireable.

For now, we'll do this only for Windows, where time.time has a lower
resolution compared to Linux (1e-7 as opposed to 1e-9).

At the same time, socket timeouts are rather inconsistent on Windows.
When a timeout is hit, recv may either throw ConnectionAbortedError
*or* return nothing. This needs to be taken into account when
expecting socket timeouts.

This patch adds release notes management to OSH [1].

When using the standard dependencies, the documentation's conf.py
had to be adapted to remove oslophinx.

While going over documentation to adapt those changes, I could
apply doc8, which is now included when running `tox -e docs`.
This now enforces documentation quality in the gates.

The documentation was therefore made doc8 compliant, mostly by
replacing tabs to spaces, and ensuring the line length didn't
exceed the recommended 79 chars, which was practically already
applied in most files, with a few exceptions fixed here.

Ubuntu Bionic updated OpenSSL package to new release:
from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1
It caused cryptography in version from lower-constraints
to fail to build in Zuul.
Additionally, constrained cryptography version did not
match the requirement for constrained PyOpenSSL.
This commit bumps the version to the minimum required
by constrained PyOpenSSL.
It works because manylinux1 (binary) wheel exists.
This version agrees also with upper-constraints for Queens.

Dependency on cryptography is removed as it is not used directly
by kolla (and requirements checker requires lower-constraints
matching version - let's not create an illusion of usage).

For stable/stein additionally fix version of sphinx to pass CI.

For stable/{rocky,queens} this does not necessarily affect CI but
may affect local testing and/or docs generation.

Adapted for stable/queens which has no lower-constraints nor

the pod is run as a daemonset on each host

Numerous times we hit issues when testing packaged versions of Kuryr
that use dependencies with versions between our lower-constraints.txt
and global requirements/upper-constraints.txt. Each time we found
issues and that's because our lower-constraints gate was not functional.
To further increase test coverage of lower-constraints this commit adds
a functional gate that will run Kuryr with old dependencies.

This is implemented by simply overwriting UPPER_CONSTRAINTS_FILE
build-arg when building Kuryr containers.

Besides that cotyledon's minimum version is raised to 1.5.0 as we're
actively using a feature added back then (it was in late 2016, so we
should be safe here).

1. No need to send a request if the list of inbound tasks is empty.
2. Instead of checking already downloaded tasks, it is more reasonable
to add filters to the request.
3. Generation of task execution cache is meaningless here, because
we only check the nearest tasks without going up the graph.

In I952d5229d6c40588cde6197683117a7e19127939 an ""got %d

It reports a log line for every allocation request under every
root provider in the candidates. In a large but sparsely used
cloud this generates a large number of log lines (see the identified
story for more details and links to examples), well more than 75%
of the lines in a log.

The information added by this particular line is not nearly as
useful as the other lines added in the change identified above.
So here, in this change, it is removed.

While this first version of release-config validation is calling
ansible directly, we could consider migrating it to molecule when the
need arises (like adding tests which need to run on specific platforms)

This also points the missing fedora28 images to centos7 until we get
them fixed (or remove the configs).

With linear stragey, the order of the pre deployment resources
are mixed, which results in NetworkDeployment before DPDK is enabled.
It will result in error in openvswitch as 'dpdk' type will not be
found until DPDK is enabled in openvswitch. It throws unwanted
error logs. As like heat deployments, ensure the config download
deployemts follow the oder for pre deployment resources, to enable
DPDK before NetworkDeployment. Providing 'free' strategy for the
playbooks, acheives the required behavior. It will be applied to
pre deployment step when DPDK is enabled.

Kolla-Ansible populates /etc/hosts with overcloud hosts using their API
interface IP address. When configured correctly, this allows Nova to use
the API interface for live migration of instances between compute hosts.

The hostname used is from the `ansible_hostname` variable, which is a
short hostname generated by Ansible using the first dot as a delimiter.
However, Nova defaults to use the result of socket.gethostname() to
register nova-compute services.

In deployments where hostnames are set to FQDNs, for example when using
FreeIPA, nova-compute would try to reach the other compute node using
its FQDN (as registered in the Nova database), which was absent from
/etc/hosts. This can result in failures to live migrate instances if
DNS entries don't match.

This commit populates /etc/hosts with `ansible_nodename` (hostname as
reported by the system) in addition to `ansible_hostname`, if they are
different.

Now this style can't make low-constraints job work, because the pip

Example:
When running low-constraints job:
According to the low-constraints file:
Babel==2.5.3[1] should be installed
Actually the log[2] shows that Babel===2.7.0[3] was installed.

  The version is excluded there because is not handled by global

  Remove the separate requirement file for bandit, because
  bandit has been part of test-requirements.txt in the last 3 years.
  There is noneed for a separate requirements file anymore.
  Even more, the bandit tox environment could be probably removed.

- synchronize the requirements for sphinx and jsonschema with the

- temporarily disable the scenario-py3 job until a new stestr

When new DVR serviceable port appears on new node we need
to update node's l3 agent with all routers which have the
port's subnets, including connected routers.
We don't need to update all nodes hosting these routers.
It costs us much as all l3 agents then go back to neutron server
and request routers info for no good reason.
This was one of the main issues with DVR at scale fixed in Mitaka.

backport: stein, rocky

During startup of nova-compute, we see the following error message:

Error gathering result from cell 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000:
DBNotAllowed: nova-compute

This issue was observed in devstack [1], and fixed [2] by removing
database configuration from the compute service.

This change takes the same approach, removing DB config from nova.conf
in the nova-compute* containers.

If name_lower of a network is changed, and service_net_map_replace
is used. The subnet defined for the network in roles_data would
have to be updated to match the new name_lower. This was not the
case prior to stein, because roles_data did'nt include the subnet.

A downstream regression test is failing because of this. The
workaround is to update roles_data with a value for the subnet
that match name_lower.

This patch should fix the need to update roles_data in the case
that the net_map_replace matches the subnet in roles_data and no
additional subnet with this defined for this network in
network_data.

It is part of a suite of features related to nested improvements.

now pass all linting checks by default. Before this change several files,
which were assumed to be needing modification by the developer, would fail
lint checks right after generation due to newline issues at the end of the

minimally functional role that is 100% compliant.

In a multi-region environment, each region is being deployed separately.
Cell discovery, however, would sometimes fail due to it picking a region
different than the one being deployed. Most likely, an internal endpoint
for region A will not be visible from region B. Furthermore, it is not
very useful to discover hosts on a region you're not modifying.

This changes the check to only run against nova compute services located

The test sets up resources in this order:

1. create volume1
2. create volume2
3. create server1 and server2 (multi-create request)
4. attach volume1 to server1
5. attach volume1 to server2
6. swap volume1 to volume2 on server1

At this point, volume1 is attached to server2 only
and volume2 is attached to server1 only.

When the test tears down, it will cleanup in this order:

1. detach volume1 from server2
2. detach volume1 from server1 (this should 404 since
   volume1 is not attached to server1 after the swap but
   the _detach_volume method ignores 404s)
3. delete server1 and server2
4. delete volume2
5. delete volume1

There is a race on teardown where tempest doesn't know
volume2 is attached to server1, deletes server1 (which
detaches volume2) but since tempest isn't waiting for
volume2 to be detached before trying to delete it, it just
goes to delete volume2 which fails because the backend
target is not yet disconnected.

This change resolves the race by having the test explicitly
detach volume2 from server1 before the automated teardown
runs.

in between the time the instance is created in the cell and the
instance mapping is updated, which would leave the instance mapping
not pointing at any cell even though the instance is created in a
cell and therefore a user could see it when listing instances (which
iterate the cells directly) but not actually perform any actions on
it, except delete - but even then delete would just delete the build
request and leave the instance orphaned in the cell (since the related
instance mapping is not pointing at the cell).

If for whatever reason we are listing instances with
a marker instance that is not a build request but whose
instance mapping does not have a cell mapping, we need
to handle it explicitly and fail, leaving a breadcrumb
for the operator to investigate, rather than a confusing
""marker not found"" error for the user.

Instances are represented in the API via build requests
before the scheduler picks a host and the instance is created
in the cell for that host. Once that is done, the instance
mapping for the instance is updated with the cell and the
build request is deleted. If the instance fails to schedule,
it is created in cell0 but the same rules apply.

If we failed to update the instance mapping with the cell
and the build request is gone, or we ignored it for some
reason while listing instances, we need to bail early with
an internal error message.

This patch covers the automation of the undercloud's operating
system upgrade using Leapp.
It includes a new option for Infrared --undercloud_os_upgrade
that will allow us to run only the specific bits to upgrade the
undercloud's OS. The node subscription needs to be done before
running this set of tasks, otherwise it will fail.

Before running leapp it's needed to clean up all the RHEL7
packages and some other packages which conflict with leapp, like
is the case of rhos-release.

Once the whole leapp upgrade and reboot has been performed, the
undercloud might be unsubscribed if desired by setting the
leapp_unregister variable.

Due to the incompatibility of the python2 binary interpreter and
RHEL8, we also need to set the ansible_python_interpreter variable
at playbook level inside infrared-plugin/main.yml.

During boot from volume, if [cinder]/cross_az_attach=False,
nova-compute will compare the instance.availability_zone,
which is set in (super)conductor once the scheduler picks a
host (see 03b4c67b22f49d325386bc3ebd2ade79b44fa699), against
the volume's availability zone.

To get the instance AZ, we call get_instance_availability_zone
which will up-call to the API DB to get the availability zone
for the instance.host if set (which by the time we hit this
during boot from volume in the compute service it is set
because the instance_claim in the resource tracker sets
instance.host).

In a split MQ deployment where the cell isn't configured to
reach ""the top"" (the API DB), this results in a
CantStartEngineError trying to query against the aggregates
table in the API DB.

The thing is, because of 03b4c67b2 in Pike, the
instance.availability_zone field will be set by the time we
do this check during boot from volume on the compute, *and*
instance.host is set because of RT.instance_claim.

So rather than do the up-call to get the AZ for the host on
which we're building, we can just pull it off the instance
if both the instance host and az fields are set.

The existing cache-based checks are left intact because older
instances created before 03b4c67b2 in Pike may have their host
field set but not the availabilty_zone field, so in that case
we'd do the up-call (although this isn't a problem for boot
from volume on those instances since they have already been
created).

The existing tests are cleaned up and better documented for
the various scenarios.

This also allows us to check one more 'up call' caveat off our
cells v2 list in the docs.

It turns out we didn't need to be sending tags to the
conductor schedule_and_build_instances method because
when we started putting the tags in the BuildRequest
that get sent to conductor, we can get the instance to
create from the BuildRequest.get_new_instance() method.

Here we plumb in the code to properly create tags when
the instance is created via the Instance object and
DB API. This is beneficial in two ways:

1. It's arguably better performance to create the tags
   at the same time as the instance while we're in the
   same DB API call rather than separate calls.

2. We want the tags set in the instance object before
   casting to the compute build_and_run_instance method.
   We want that because otherwise the instance.create
   versioned notification method in compute will end
   up lazy-loading the instance tags, so this is another
   performance optimization.

Along the way, we can also remove the redundant
TagList.destroy call in conductor because we destroy
the tags when we destroy the instance down in the DB API.

When the RabbitMQ experience a rolling restart of its peers, the
master of an HA queue fails over from one replica to another.

If there are messages sent to the HA queue while some rabbit
nodes are restarting, the latter will reconnect as unsynchronized
slaves. It can happen that during a rolling restart, all rabbit
nodes reconnect as unsynchronized, which prevents RabbitMQ to
automatically elect a new Master for failover. This has other
side effects on fanout queues and may prevent OpenStack
notification to be consumed properly.

Change the HA policy to always allow a promotion even when all
replicas are unsynchronized. When such rare condition happens,
rely on OpenStack client to retry RPC if they need to.

In our efforts to clean up meters that were removed from Ceilometer
in the Rocky release (see c51491676156a9956206c6785159be3c89390cb3 )
the ceilosca_pipeline.yaml was deleted. However, that file is needed
for the devstack plugin, as specified in devstack/settings .

This patch restores that file, and renames it to make the purpose
clearer.

Also added comments to the pipeline.yaml files to indicate their
purpose.

Currently we cannot provide domain scoped tokens with
the admin user due to it not being assigned the admin
role for the default domain.

This patch makes it so we assign the proper role on bootstrap.

This happens because cloud-controller-manager starts running before
needed secrets exist in kubernetes. Cloud-controller-manager lists secrets

doesn't exist it starts a watch until it does. As this is not allowed the

This commit adds protection testing for the token API along with
changes to default policies to properly consume system-scope and
default roles.

Originally, this work was going to include the ability for project and
domain administrator to validate, check, or revoke tokens within the
context of their authorization (e.g., a domain administrator could
revoke tokens on projects within their domain). This seems like extra
work for not much benefit since we're using bearer tokens. The holder
of the token can do anything with that token, which means they can
validate it or revoke it without using their own token. Adding
project and domain administrator support seems unnecessary given the
existing functionality. If someone comes forward asking for this
functionality, we can re-evaluate the effort. For now, this patch is
limited to system user support, allowing them to validate, check, and
revoke any token in the system. Service users can still validate
tokens on behalf of users. Users can do anything they wish with their
own tokens.

This commit also bumps the minimum version of oslo.log so that we can
use the official TRAIN deprecated release marker.
