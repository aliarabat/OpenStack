Before, while a container was in sharding state, a container GET
called ContainerBroker.list_objects_iter() on the retiring broker,
with the goal of listing any objects in the retiring
db. list_objects_iter() flushes any pending object updates into the
broker's object table, which in this scenario was the retiring db,
causing the retiring db to be polluted.

The opportunity for pending updates to pollute the retiring db during
a container GET was limited; before calling list_objects_iter() the
container GET method calls the broker get_info_is_deleted() method
which also flushes the pending file, so the vulnerability is only to
updates arriving in the pending file after that point in time.

However, there are other place where the pending file might be flushed
into the *retiring* db, for example as a side effect of calling
get_info() or get_items_since(). Although we generally expect object
updates to be redirected away from a sharding container, this may not
always be the case, for example while a shard range is found but not
yet created.

This patch adds an attribute 'skip_commits' to DatabaseBroker which
when True will prevent the broker ever committing records to its db
via _commit_puts() method.  'skip_commits' is False by default (legacy
behaviour) but is set to True whenever a broker is created for a
retiring db using ContainerBroker.get_brokers().

Note that 'skip_commits' does not prevent objects being directly
merged to the db via a direct call to merge_items().

During a resize, the RequestSpec.flavor is updated
to the new flavor. If the resize failed on one host
and was rescheduled, the RequestSpec.retry is updated
for that failed host and mistakenly persisted, which
can affect later move operations, like if an admin
targets one of those previously failed hosts for a
live migration or evacuate operation.

This change fixes the problem by not ever persisting
the RequestSpec.retry field to the database, since
retries are per-request/operation and not something
that needs to be persisted.

Alternative to this, we could reset the retry field
in the RequestSpec.reset_forced_destinations method
but that would be slightly overloading the meaning
of that method, and the approach taken in this patch
is arguably cleaner since retries shouldn't ever be
persisted. It should be noted, however, that one
advantage to resetting the 'retry' field in the
RequestSpec.reset_forced_destinations method would
be to avoid this issue for any existing DB entries
that have this problem.

The related functional regression test is updated
to show the bug is now fixed.

Commit 74ab427d4796d8a386f84a15cc49188c2a60f8f1 in Newton added
code to persist changes to the RequestSpec during a resize since
the flavor changes.

That change inadvertantly also persisted any failed hosts during
the resize that are stored in the RequestSpec.retry field during
a reschedule.

The problem is that later those persisted failed hosts are rejected
by the RetryFilter, which can be confusing if an admin is trying
to live migrate or evacate the instance to one of those specific
hosts.

This adds a functional regression test to show the failure, which
will be fixed in a separate change that then modifies the assertions.

The recent ""Meltdown"" CVE fixes have resulted in a critical performance
penalty[*] that will impact every Nova guest with certain CPU models.

I.e. assume you have applied all the ""Meltdown"" CVE fixes, and performed
a cold reboot (explicit stop & start) of all Nova guests, for the
updates to take effect.  Now, if any guests that are booted with certain
named virtual CPU models (e.g. ""IvyBridge"", ""Westmere"", etc), then those
guests, will incur noticeable performance degradation[*], while being
protected from the CVE itself.

To alleviate this guest performance impact, it is now important to
specify an obscure Intel CPU feature flag, 'PCID' (Process-Context ID)
-- for the virtual CPU models that don't already include it (more on
this below).  To that end, this change will allow Nova to explicitly
specify CPU feature flags via a new configuration attribute,
`cpu_model_extra_flags`, e.g. in `nova.conf`:

    ...
    [libvirt]
    cpu_mode = custom
    cpu_model = IvyBridge
    cpu_model_extra_flags = pcid
    ...

NB: In the first iteration, the choices for `cpu_model_extra_flags` is
restricted to only 'pcid' (the option is case-insensitive) -- to address
the earlier mentioned guest performance degradation.  A future patch
will remove this restriction, allowing to add / remove multiple CPU
feature flags, thus making way for other useful features.

Some have asked: ""Why not simply hardcode the 'PCID' CPU feature flag
into Nova?""  That's not graceful, and more importantly, impractical:

  (1) Not every Intel CPU model has 'PCID':

       - The only Intel CPU models that include the 'PCID' capability
         are: ""Haswell"", ""Broadwell"", and ""Skylake"" variants.

       - The libvirt / QEMU Intel CPU models: ""Nehalem"", ""Westmere"",
         ""SandyBridge"", and ""IvyBridge"" will *not* expose the 'PCID'
         capability, even if the host CPUs by the same name include it.
         I.e. 'PCID' needs to be explicitly when using the said virtual
         CPU models.

  (2) Magically adding new CPU feature flags under the user's feet
      impacts live migration.

This reverts commit da1552359561a35b802dde534073f2ea5fec6372.

systemd-resolved was not really involed in this.  What seems to be
happening is that during the initial chroot creation there is no
/etc/resolv.conf file, and so the systemd postinst script creates one
pointing to the compatability files created by systemd-resolved.

This is not what we want, but dib doesn't really provide a way for us
to overwrite the file.  That is covered in
Ie0e97d8072e2b21a54b053fa6fb07b62960c686d

We actually want systemd-resolved running -- it provides the dbus
nameserver api stuff that some tools may use.  If /etc/resolv.conf is
a file, systemd-resolved leaves it alone and uses it for resolution as
you would expect.  (we do, however, want to wait for the depends-on to
ensure the image has a correct /etc/resolv.conf before merging this).

solution to make self-signed certificates work in conjunction with
raw IPv6 addresses consistently, so we skip the failing test.

Names of resource providers, resource classes, and traits in placement
are restricted to certain characters and lengths.  Consumers (e.g. virt
driver implementations of update_provider_tree) may wish to generate
such names dynamically based on inputs that don't necessarily know or
follow those rules.  Such consumers could use a convenient way to
sanitize such generated names such that they conform to what placement
expects.

This change set introduces a `slugify` method into the
(eventually-to-be-split-into-a-common-library)
nova.api.openstack.placement.lib module.  It will sanitize a string to
make a suitable resource provider, resource class, or trait name.  The
caller gets to decide whether a too-long string is truncated or results
in an exception.

(I72cab0131ccffb1989d6c1324d0c9b92166782da) but for all branches.

Also add the queens rdo repository paths. As stable branches now
include have queens.

it's important to scope where these tasks are run

The sope of the play now runs against the same scope

This will allow us to get around a tricky error in heatclient template
processing with persisted user-environment.yaml on
upgrade. Interestingly, we need the old file to exist in the plan so
that we can map the resource to OS::Heat::None during the upgrade
process (heatclient tries to fetch it even though a subsequent env
file would map the resource to None), and all alternative solutions
are considerably worse than just putting the file back in place.

We will not need this file in Rocky as the resource will be mapped to
None before upgrading Q->R. This commit is specific for P->Q upgrade.

This prevents forcing keepalived to renegotiate roles between amps more
times than necessary.

Keepalived is already running at the point that we do our initial ""amp
start"" command, so if we actually force a restart it loses its state and
has to renegotiate. I would consider the fact that this works without
issue right now ""very good luck"". Let's make this more sane, and only
reload if that's what we need to do.

In order to make monasca-ui python3 compatible this
patch set:
- Add six to requirements.txt
- Add py35 to tox.ini
- Replace dict.iteritems() with six.iteritems(dict)
- Replace prit msg with print(msg)
- Replace unicode with six.text_type(msg)
- Replaces urlparse with six.moves.urllib
- Python 3 getting the keys() of a dict returns
  a dict_keys object instead of a list
- python 2.x calling keys makes a copy of the key
  that you can iterate over while modifying the dict.
  This doesn't work in python 3.x because keys
  returns an iterator instead of a list.
  Another way is to use list to force a copy of the keys
  to be made.

The test as initially written was realizing route leaking
in a way that was not avoiding the leaked routes from being
also imported by the VRF for the intermediate VMs. These
routes competing with direct routes to the ultimate destination
were sometimes (depending on route selection and load balancing)
preventing connectivity.

This change modifies the way leaking is done and the way RTs are
used to avoid this.

This reverts commit bd48087520c5f0846363bdc0c025508ba450ceb3.

After further inspection It seems that panko dbsync shouldn't be
needed, as it will upgrade an newly created empty db.

And this is assuming we find a way to:
 - configure panko database connection properly
 - create the db

Knowing that we don't have access to this information[1] as the
new hieradata haven't been rendered at this stage.

So all that to upgrade a newly (I guess empty) database seems like too
much trouble.

The db will be created in the last step of the FFU.

When the repo container is removed, the apt cache config
is still in place and causes problems. This is due to the
tasks running to remove the cache configuration not
executing early enough in the deployment.

This patch re-orders the tasks so that the removal can
be done and the cache is updated afterwards to confirm
a working state.

It also makes the configuration happen on all hosts, then
all containers, at the right timings to ensure that if the
container is removed, the proxy config will also be removed
automatically.

The mode was incorrectly defined as configuring the mode for OVS when it
is really configuring the client/server mode for QEMU.  A value of
'client' here will cause OVS to create the  vhostuser socket, and
actually make OVS the server.  This type of port is deprecated so the
default should be 'server' (QEMU creates the port).

We currently have a pod subnet ovs internal port created in devstack.
This allows the kubelet to do the necessary container probes. The
problem is that if we run host networking pods that need to access the
API they won't be able to do it in the expected way (sending HTTP
requests to the clusterIP of the API).

This patch addresses it via routing, so the kubelet iface is used for
the service access.

This patch is making the test test_create_port_when_quotas_is_full more
generic to work with different ML2 drivers.

The test is being changed to set the quotas to the number of existing
ports + 1, instead of having it hardcoded to 1. The reason for that is
because the ML2/OVN driver does create a port to be used by the metadata
service upon creating a new network. That would then already fulfil the
ports quota for that tenant.

When l3 agent is restarted on a dvr_snat node that is configured
for L3_HA and has a centralized FloatingIP configured to the
qg-interface in the snat_namespace, that FloatingIP is not
re-configured to the qg-interface when agent starts.

The reason being, the cidr is not being retrieved from the
keepalived instance and only retrieved from the
centralized_fip_cidr_set.

If 'L3_HA' is configured we need to retrieve it from the keepalived
instance.

This patch fixes the problem by retrieving the cidrs from the

The shard range EXPANDING state was introduced in [1] as a means of
preventing an acceptor shard range treating updates from its donor as
misplaced objects during shrinking. The state was needed because the
acceptor namespace was not expanded prior to shrinking starting, so
the donor's objects would appear to be misplaced in the acceptor.

Now that the proxy controller is able to cope with overlapping shard
ranges when building concatenated shard listings, it is possible for
the acceptor namespace to be expanded prior to shrinking and for the
acceptor to temporarily overlap the donor in the root container. This
makes the EXPANDING state unnecessary.

There is no longer any need for the special case that excluded other
shard ranges from updates to root while shrinking since the root now
already knows about the acceptor's expanded namespace.

New releases of oslo.config support a 'mutable' parameter to Opts.

Based on nova commit 32c8ac6b7dfe4ca0c211cbce7c5a67d88558126f

The new file was generated by oslopolicy-sample-generator:
  oslopolicy-sample-generator --namespace nova --format json

nova uses policy-in-code now, so there is a lot of differences.
Sorted version diff is http://paste.openstack.org/show/628742/

All policies with ""@"" have been dropped.
Dropped policies used in horizon are:
  os_compute_api:os-certificates:create
  os_compute_api:os-scheduler-hints:discoverable
  os_compute_api:os-server-groups:discoverable

[discoverable]
""discoverable"" policies are related to nova API extensions
but the API extension mechanism has gone in Nova Queens,
so these policies now make no sense in Nova.
In Horizon side, we are still use a bit older API version
to launch instance, so it seems some fallback policies are needed
and they are added as conf/nova_policy.d.

[os_compute_api:os-certificates:create]
No corresponding policy is found, so the related policy check is dropped.
EC2 API is provided as a separate project from nova.
I guess this is the reason the policy was dropped.
DownloadEC2 action referred to it, but we already checks EC2 service
is available so I believe the policy can be dropped safely.

[openstack_dashboard.test.unit.api.rest.test_policy]
Unit tests are updated according to the nova policy change.
Note that test_rule_alone previously succeeded because it used
non-existing policy and fallbacked to 'default' rule.
The rule is changed to a policy for non-admin user.

The cancel_all_events function was incorrectly assuming
that event tags didn't have dashes in them, but they all
do since they are either port or volume IDs, which are UUIDs.

Instead of just storing our event data indexed by the composite
event key, we should just store the name and tag distinctly so
that there is no question about how to dissect the two from the
key later. This is all internal record-keeping inside of the
compute manager, so we can change it to whatever we want.

This includes a slight change to the internal virtapi interface
for wait_for_instance_event(), which removes the ability to
pass composite event keys as strings instead of (name, tag)
tuples. In reality, none of the virt code was using the key string
format, so this just cleans up a few tests that were. It makes
that interface less ambiguous, which is good anyway.

Enhance the code that migrates the ConfKeyManager's fixed_key to
Barbican to also consider the Backup table. When the original key
migration feature was added, the encryption key ID was not stored in
the Backup table. But now the Backup table contains that field, so
the migration code needs to handle that table as well.

Whereas the cinder-volume service is responsible for migrating keys
in the Volume and Snapshot tables, the cinder-backup service handles
migrating keys in the Backup table. Each instance of the service
migrates its own entries by matching the ""host"" field in the
corresponding tables.

The Backup OVO now inherits from base.CinderComparableObject. This does
not affect the object's hash signature, and so the version number does
need to be incremented.

The do_image_download code has a check to make sure that there's
a place to put the data (either filename or stdout redirect) before
initiating the download.  The location of this check was moved by
change I841bebeda38814235079429eca0b1e5fd2f04dae to happen at the
beginning of the function.  The two intermittently failing tests
do not explicitly address the check condition, and as a result the
tests do exit early, but before they can check what they're supposed
to be testing.

Angular errors on login page are caused by loading ngdetails view.
Although registration of URL for ngdetails is executed on top level

To fix this issue, this patch moves registration of URL for ngdetails

Openstack PKI token support was dropped in the Pike release.
The following update ensures that PKI token validation is
only run if the release is supported when the sync leader
broadcasts any service credentials to its peers.

In this case; if the release is <= pike. then we can sync
token certs and ensure the pki permissions are valid.
Otherwise this action will be skipped.

Currently even if we have closed an election when we build the docs we
still determine the full name, email address and IRC nick for all
candidates for a series (i.e both PTL and TC candidates for Rocky while
only running the rocky TC election)

Stop doing that.  This means that we reduce the REST-API hits during doc
builds, generally speed up the docs generation and importantly allow us
to change the process from looking this up from git to probing the
OpenStack Foundation membership DB.

Adding a flag to state the election type (or phase) will also allow us
to, in future changes, auto-validate candidates and generally streamline
the process.

NOTE: This change also forces all calls to filter() to be ""listified"" to
work the same under py2 and py3

As you can see from the results below, before we were looking up PTL data
from git, which this change stops.  After this change the expected git
queries still happen:

Here, the first page of the developer guide is an onboarding
page, explaining our repos, what's inside them, and how to
contribute. It then links towards all the sections, which
had to be restructured to match a wizard-style flow.

This patch adds a deprecation notice to the action code, the file

The BGP RTs used in the tests were initially constants, reused
by the different tests.  This is safe only if tests are not
run in parallel, but not when they are concurrently run, because
some routes advertised by one test may be imported in routing
tables from another test.

To solve this, we need to dynamic allocation of RTs so that
different tests use different RTs, to ensure isolation
between the different tests.

Create a lower-constraints.txt to be used to enforce the lower bounds
in those tests.

Add openstack-tox-lower-constraints job to the zuul configuration.

See http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2018-March/128352.html

The Glance install guide suggests using 'default' as the
user_domain_name and project_domain_name, whereas the Keystone
install guide, which people would be consulting earlier, instructs
the installer to use 'Default'.  Since the name is case-sensitive,
this is causing problems for first-time installers of OpenStack.

Adds a new CI job, kayobe-seed-centos, that deploys a single VM as a
seed host. The VM provided by Zuul is configured as the seed, rather
than a seed hypervisor that provisions a seed VM using nested virt.

This approach should be more reliable, faster, and easier to get
working, at the expense of not testing the seed hypervisor code paths.

Currently the seed services are deployed, but not tested. A future
change could test discovery and provisioning of an overcloud host using
the seed.

For API versions >= 1.28, Port & portgroup's .extra['vif_port_id'] was
deprecated in Ocata. Before we can remove support for this, we need to
copy that information to the object's internal_info['tenant_vif_port_id'].

This copy/migration is done at the API layer when the user specifies the
.extra[] value, as well as when the 'ironic db-sync online_data-migrations'
is run.

In order to know whether the ports and port groups have been migrated,
their IronicObject versions are incremented.

This also fixes it so that for API versions < 1.28, the deprecation
warning is not shown, since we still need to support extra['vif_port_id']
in this case.

When a port or portgroup's .extra['vif_port_id'] is removed via a
PATCH API request, that VIF is removed from that object's internal_info.

Add checks to the image-create-via-import commmand so that it provides

The recent ""Meltdown"" CVE fixes have resulted in a critical performance
penalty[*] that will impact every Nova guest with certain CPU models.

I.e. assume you have applied all the ""Meltdown"" CVE fixes, and performed
a cold reboot (explicit stop & start) of all Nova guests, for the
updates to take effect.  Now, if any guests that are booted with certain
named virtual CPU models (e.g. ""IvyBridge"", ""Westmere"", etc), then those
guests, will incur noticeable performance degradation[*], while being
protected from the CVE itself.

To alleviate this guest performance impact, it is now important to
specify an obscure Intel CPU feature flag, 'PCID' (Process-Context ID)
-- for the virtual CPU models that don't already include it (more on
this below).  To that end, this change will allow Nova to explicitly
specify CPU feature flags via a new configuration attribute,
`cpu_model_extra_flags`, e.g. in `nova.conf`:

    ...
    [libvirt]
    cpu_mode = custom
    cpu_model = IvyBridge
    cpu_model_extra_flags = pcid
    ...

NB: In the first iteration, the choices for `cpu_model_extra_flags` is
restricted to only 'pcid' (the option is case-insensitive) -- to address
the earlier mentioned guest performance degradation.  A future patch
will remove this restriction, allowing to add / remove multiple CPU
feature flags, thus making way for other useful features.

Some have asked: ""Why not simply hardcode the 'PCID' CPU feature flag
into Nova?""  That's not graceful, and more importantly, impractical:

  (1) Not every Intel CPU model has 'PCID':

       - The only Intel CPU models that include the 'PCID' capability
         are: ""Haswell"", ""Broadwell"", and ""Skylake"" variants.

       - The libvirt / QEMU Intel CPU models: ""Nehalem"", ""Westmere"",
         ""SandyBridge"", and ""IvyBridge"" will *not* expose the 'PCID'
         capability, even if the host CPUs by the same name include it.
         I.e. 'PCID' needs to be explicitly when using the said virtual
         CPU models.

  (2) Magically adding new CPU feature flags under the user's feet
      impacts live migration.

compute nodes (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/510327) the
logic for requiring external bridges should take into account
what group a particular compute node is in. If it is
'inner-compute' then an external bridge is not required.

This prevents forcing keepalived to renegotiate roles between amps more
times than necessary.

Keepalived is already running at the point that we do our initial ""amp

has to renegotiate. I would consider the fact that this works without
issue right now ""very good luck"". Let's make this more sane, and only
