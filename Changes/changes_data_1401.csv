However, at that time, we were still allowing the Glance client to upload chunked-transfer-encoded BLOBs without specifying the Content-Length header (as it is NOT required to be set for chunked-transfer encoded requests). In addition, we found out that if we attempted to make the Webob.Request.body seekable, that webob would ready the entire request body into memory, which caused some major OOM bugs for us with Windows images. Not good.\n\nUnfortunately, what this meant was that there was no way for the Swift storage driver to tell if a request was going to exceed the 5GB limit and thus need to write segments of data to Swift and then an object manifest file. And so, we wrote code that, when seeing an image size of 0 (if no Content-Length was specified), we created a temporary disk buffer and wrote a chunk of the incoming image to disk and then supplied that seekable disk-based file descriptor to the Swift client\'s put_object() method, calculating the image\'s checksum along the way as we wrote the segments to the disk buffer.\n\nThis particular patch addressed a bug in that disk-buffer code that was incorrectly setting the image_size in the registry database to 0 if the image_size passed to the Swift driver was 0 (unknown).\n\nHowever, when Ewan went to fix a bug that was introduced a few patches back, he came up with a simple and innovative way of getting rid of the disk buffer entirely. His solution removes the prior assumption that images <5G must be written to Swift using a single put_object() call and he removed the need for a disk buffer by adding a simple call to delete 0-sized chunks (which end up being created if the image_size passed to the Swift driver is 0 (unknown))\n\nLong explanation, but that\'s the story of why this code looked the way it did and why I\'m happier with Ewan\'s patch to replace this bit of code :)\n\nCheers,\n-jay'}, {'account_id': 1247, 'date': '2012-01-11 06:43:01.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 1: Do not submit\n\nOk, I'm going to abandon this for now and see how Ewan's version settles down on master.""}, {'account_id': 1247, 'date': '2012-01-11 06:43:23.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 1: Abandoned\n\nWaiting for this area to settle down on master'}]","[{'created': '2012-01-06 08:54:18.000000000', 'message': 'Secondary iteration of fix for bug 891738\n\nA problem exists that images larger than large_object_size without a\nknown image_size will fail to be segmented and hence fail to be added\nto swift.\n\nThis patch alters the chunking process slightly:\n\n- Instead of reading min(large_object_chunk_size, bytes_left) from the\n  stream, simply read large_object_chunk_size until we reach EOL(None).\n  This works even when there is less than large_object_chunk_size bytes\n  amount available.\n\n- The image_size can be determined from the combined length of each\n  chunk read.

A problem exists that images larger than large_object_size without a
known image_size will fail to be segmented and hence fail to be added
to swift.

This patch alters the chunking process slightly:

- Instead of reading min(large_object_chunk_size, bytes_left) from the
  stream, simply read large_object_chunk_size until we reach EOL(None).
  This works even when there is less than large_object_chunk_size bytes
  amount available.

- The image_size can be determined from the combined length of each
  chunk read. If we are passed an unknown image_size this value can be
  used for the registry.

Test Changes:

- Fixed bug in fake_put_object which was highlighted by Jay when
  reviewing this changeset.
  The put of the manifest object needed to be moved inside the
  check for previous existence of a key.

- Added test_add_large_object_zero_size to
  glance.tests.unit.test_swift_store:TestStore.

  This unit test demonstrates the bug and will test for regressions. It
  mirrors test_add_large_object but specifies an image_size of 0 to
  excercise the new code path.

This implements a [hosts] <=> [images] mapping in the simple scheduler
that partitions your host resources into the part that services a
particular image set, and the general cloud.  This is useful, for
example, if you want to specify a set of hosts to run utility VMs
(cloudpipe, bastion, etc) that you don't want consuming resources from
your generally available pool.

When specifying a host with --isolated_hosts flags (comma-separated
list) those hosts will only run the images specified in
--isolated_images, and will not run any other images.  The isolated
images will not run on any other hosts.

You can specify --skip_isolated_core_check to allow overcommitting of
the isolated hosts.  This allows utility vms that are not cpu bound to
avoid the resource cheks the scheduler usually performs (based off of
--max_cores).

We log a warning and remove the offending server from the list

Remove the use of a temporary disk buffer when streaming to Swift.  This
was added on the assumption that it was not possible to stream chunks to
Swift direct from webob.Request.body_file.  That's not true -- a simple
file-like object wrapping body_file does the job perfectly.

This removes the need for swift_store_object_buffer_dir in the config file.
It is also significantly cheaper, since there is one copy fewer.

Fix the parsing of the swift_store_large_object_size and
swift_store_large_object_chunk_size options.  These are
specified in MB in the config file, but needs to be in bytes internally,
because they are compared against the image_size parameter given to add().

Update the unit tests to match.  This includes an additional check that
put_object is called the correct number of times.  The unit tests missed the
latter problem problem because there was no check that a small object is only
uploaded in one chunk, and despite the comment to the contrary there was no
check that the right number of chunks were written in the large-object case
either.  Added these in all places where store.add is called.

* Adds skippers to tempest to enable skipping tests

Just a thought.\n\n-jay""}, {'account_id': 4, 'date': '2012-01-03 20:24:55.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 8.'}, {'account_id': 4, 'date': '2012-01-03 20:25:30.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7: (4 inline comments)\n\nLatest patch addresses feedback from Ed & Jay.'}, {'account_id': 4, 'date': '2012-01-03 20:26:23.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 8: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve\n\n'}, {'account_id': 1063, 'date': '2012-01-03 21:18:36.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 7: (2 inline comments)\n\nJust added some comments to your replies.'}, {'account_id': 4, 'date': '2012-01-03 22:38:08.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 9.'}, {'account_id': 4, 'date': '2012-01-03 22:41:17.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 9: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve\n\nImplemented Ed\'s last comment.\n\nSpecifically, support for:\n\n    ob.start()\n    print ""foobar""\n    ob.stop()\n    buffer_contents = ob.read()\n    assert buffer_contents == ""foobar\\n""'}, {'account_id': 1063, 'date': '2012-01-03 23:06:28.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 9: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve\n\n'}, {'account_id': 7, 'date': '2012-01-03 23:30:32.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 9: Looks good to me (core reviewer)\n\nw00t. nice work.'}, {'account_id': 5, 'date': '2012-01-04 00:04:03.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 9: Looks good to me (core reviewer)\n\nNice!\n\nWaiting on command implementations to go in before approving (otherwise we lose the old, but working keystone-manage and get the new one with an incomplete command set and help)'}, {'account_id': 4, 'date': '2012-01-04 16:12:30.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 10.'}, {'account_id': 4, 'date': '2012-01-04 16:14:18.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 9:\n\nFixed pep8 (keystone/tools/buffout.py:27:27: W602 deprecated form of raising exception) and included a unit test to show that exception raising works as expected from a 'with' block.""}, {'account_id': 4, 'date': '2012-01-04 16:15:07.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 10: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve\n\n'}, {'account_id': 5, 'date': '2012-01-04 16:49:29.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 10: Looks good to me (core reviewer); Approved\n\n'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-01-04 16:53:24.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 10: Fails\n\nBuild Failed \n \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-integration-tests-devstack-vm/254/ : SUCCESS \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-json/148/ : SUCCESS \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-pep8/658/ : SUCCESS \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-pylint/734/ : SUCCESS \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-unittests/219/ : FAILURE \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-merge/617/ : SUCCESS'}, {'account_id': 4, 'date': '2012-01-05 19:53:43.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 11.'}, {'account_id': 4, 'date': '2012-01-05 19:54:28.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 11: Approved\n\nFixed broken unit test; re-running merge.'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-01-05 20:03:49.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 11: Verified\n\nBuild Successful \n \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-integration-tests-devstack-vm/312/ : SUCCESS \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-json/150/ : SUCCESS \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-pep8/660/ : SUCCESS \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-pylint/736/ : SUCCESS \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-unittests/221/ : SUCCESS \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-merge/619/ : SUCCESS'}, {'account_id': 5, 'date': '2012-01-06 06:32:19.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 11: Looks good to me (core reviewer); Approved\n\n'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-01-06 06:43:28.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 11:\n\nBuild Successful \n \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-integration-tests-devstack-vm/325/ : SUCCESS \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-pep8/663/ : SUCCESS \nhttps://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-keystone-unittests/224/ : SUCCESS'}, {'account_id': 3, 'date': '2012-01-06 06:43:29.000000000', 'content': 'Change has been successfully merged into the git repository.'}]","[{'created': '2011-12-21 17:14:28.000000000', 'message': ""Initial keystone-manage rewrite (bp keystone-manage2)\n\n- Example usage: ./bin/keystone-manage --help\n- Example usage: ./bin/keystone-manage version --help\n- Commands are implemented as decorated classes\n- The name of the command module *is* the name of the command\n- Testing\n  -

Please note that this is an example and we may need to actually move the check into the compute.manager instead of compute.api.  Ultimately all related data should be loaded in the api, rbac should be checked, and upon passing, all relevant data should be sent through the queue to the manager.  Unfortunately not all data is currently available at the api layer, so it requires extra rpc and database calls.  This is inefficient, wo we may need to put the rbac checking in compute.manager for now, and move it to api when the loading happens.\n\ntl, dr;\nYes it is inefficient.\n\nIn response to the concern about blocks being added to all calls: I managed to do a decorator version in compute manager for all of the instance calls in an old version, but it was super hacky because we don't have the full objects upon entry to the methods.

gerrit review 1986
------------------
Updates simple scheduler to allow strict availability_zone scheduling

This update adds strict availability_zone scheduling of new instances when
an availabity_zone option is not present in the creation call.  This patch
does not change the expected default behavior.

Previous behavior was to default the zone to None and only update the zone
in the scheduler if an availability_zone was supplied.  This incorrectly
allowed the scheduler to place new instances created without an
availability_zone onto compute nodes where the availability_zone had been
changed to something other than the default of 'nova'.

Setting default_schedule_zone to 'nova' will prevent new instance scheduling
into availability_zones other than the default 'nova' zone.  This change
defaults the zone to None but allows the user to override this with the
default_schedule_flag.

In practice, if you have 2 availability_zones (nova, megazone) you can
configure default_schedule_zone on the API node to 'nova' and any instances
created will be created into the 'nova' availability_zone if one was not
supplied.  Instances created with an availability_zone will be created as
normal into the availability_zone supplied.

Add availabity_zone to the refresh list

The availability_zone column for a service record is not updated if the
availability_zone is changed after the record was created.  This patch
adds availability_zone to the update list in report_state if the
availability_zone stored in the database does not match the local flag

This is based on a similar change to nova:
https://review.openstack.org/#change,2800

Loading install_requires with the contents of pip-requires
isn't getting us any real beneift and is causing issues.

a) It can conflict with installing keystone into an environment
where deps have been installed from packages (devstack)
b) It breaks the ability to use -e git urls in pip-requires
which we want to start using for python-novaclient and
python-keystoneclient
c) It causes spurious network traffic when we're trying to
test things.

At the same time, since we are not expecting anyone to install
keystone from setup.py for production, the normal benefit of the
feature is not needed.

a) It can conflict with installing nova into an environment

Fixes bug #910295

The None, True, and False values are singletons.

All variable *comparisons* to singletons should use 'is' or 'is not'.
All variable *evaluations* to boolean should use 'if' or 'if not'.

""== None"", ""== True"", ""== False"", and ""!= None"" comparisons in sqlalchemy's
where(), or_(), filter(), and_(), and select() functions should not be changed.

Incorrect comparisons or evaluations in comments were not changed.

- Added logging along the way
- unittest.skip not working in test_middleware, so explicitely
  raised SkipTest exceptions
- Made test suites skip intelligently if test filter calls for
  client, functional, or unit tests
- Configured all suite config files to point to same log file
  to more easily debug when running multiple suites

This is a bit of a scheduler refactoring to support future scaling work
as a part of blueprint scaling-zones.

With or without that blueprint work, this cleans a number of things up
and paves the way for combining a lot of the schedulers by using this
new 'HostManager' for filtering and weighing (future work :)

On to the goodies:

Introduces new HostManager, splitting code out from ZoneManager.
Zone communication and management is handlded in the ZoneManager.
Host filtering and weighing is handled in the HostManager.
ZoneManager is removed from the SchedulerManager and direct calls to it
  from the SchedulerManager now occur via the scheduler driver.  This
  simplifies a number of things.
ZoneManager and HostManager classes to use are now flags.  This allows
  one to extend the current classes and use them.
HostManager uses a HostState class to keep info about hosts.  This class
  needs to be extendable.  Since it's very much tied to the HostManager,
  the HostState class to use is not a flag.  It is, instead, a class
  variable in HostManager.
Filtering functions now accept a single host to filter.  This improves
  performance by not having to build a new array of hosts within every
  filter function.
Filtering functions now accept a more generic 'filter_properties'
  dictionary which we can fill with information available for filtering.
  Adding additional data to this 'filter_properties' can be done by
  subclassing.
Weighing functions now accept this 'filter_properties', also, although
  it's poorly named ATM.  Will be cleaned up in a future branch when I
  move some weighing functions into the host manager.
Filtering functions are now topic-specific, so we can support more than
  just compute host filtering.
Filtering tests are true unit tests now.
test_zones was moved from top level to under scheduler as zone_manager
  tests and refactored to be true unit tests.
Host tests are true unit tests now.

Glance used a SimpleQueue which would end up with a direct queue with an
exchange named the same as the queue. This was different than Nova, which
uses a topic queue with an exchange named 'nova'.

This change makes Glance use a topic queue with a configurable exchange

An instance IP will generally be a private IP, and it will be assigned to a DNS address that is most likely also private.  The instance driver may simply modify /etc/hosts file or make some other minor, local change.  This registration happens automatically anytime an instance is created or halted.  There will generally only be a single instance DNS entry for a single instance.\n\nFloating IPs are public, so the floating driver will need to act on a public DNS database:  a zone file, or a powerDNS back-end, or something like that.  Floating DNS entries can be created or deleted interactively at any time, and there can be multiple entries for a given IP.""}, {'account_id': 679, 'date': '2011-12-20 20:42:22.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve\n\n'}, {'account_id': 1132, 'date': '2011-12-20 20:50:52.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this\n\n(6 inline comments)\n\nCan you also add some testing for the xml serialization?""}, {'account_id': 1998, 'date': '2011-12-21 03:22:12.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 5.'}, {'account_id': 1998, 'date': '2011-12-21 03:22:58.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 4: (6 inline comments)\n\nserialization tests added, as well.'}, {'account_id': 100, 'date': '2011-12-21 22:33:27.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 5: (4 inline comments)\n\n'}, {'account_id': 1998, 'date': '2011-12-22 05:09:02.000000000', 'content': 'Patch Set 5: (4 inline comments)\n\n'}, {'account_id': 1998, 'date': '2011-12-22 05:09:47.000000000', 'content': 'Uploaded patch set 6.'}, {'account_id': 1132, 'date': '2011-12-22 14:13:18.000000000', 'content': ""Patch Set 6:\n\nCan you write up an overview of the API interface you're creating in this extension?

There are also two minor fixes not related to the bug.

1. fixed the LDAP filter where it was comparing serviceId string with

Stolen from a previous patchset submitted by Johannes Erdfelt. This
change will make it easier to have less restrictive state checking when
processing compute actions such as deletes. In particular, it becomes
easier in a future patch to support deletes or revert_resizes in the
middle of a resize.

The compute manager allows multiple operations on an instance to run at
the same time, creating a variety of interesting race conditions. This
change serializes compute methods to an individual instance. If an
instance is deleted while it is still being built, the delete will now
wait until after the build is finished.

- this is a squash of 6 commits
- original commits are vailable for cherry-picking here:
  https://github.com/ziadsawalha/keystone/commits/tests

Removed test dependency on sampledata
- added fixtures in FunctionalTestCase class
- updated tests to use created fixtures
- only kept boot-strap creations in KeystoneTestCase

Note: This has significantly slowed down tests, but this will
allow us to continue refactoring tests to not go through HTTP
and not require a running server (where not needed).

Backend test suites (SQL, LDAP, etc) can also now be run
separately and in parallel since they don't need a TCP/IP
port. These tests no longer use http(s).

Update to Tenant serialization

- Correctly handle description as an optional attribute
  of tenant
- added tests that fail where blank description was coming
  back as 'None' string.
- added fixes to handle None correctly (check for None
  before calling str(value)

Separated out test suites

- Unit, Functional, and Client (HTTP) suites can be run separately
- -O flag in run_tests now accepts UnitTests and ClientTests as options
- run_tests will run all suites (but end up executing less tests
  overall since Unit tests run once and client tests run twice; for
  HTTP and HTTPS/SSL tests

Fixed 'python setup.py test' not running

Handling generic exceptions (500, 501, 400) from the rest client makes sense, but I think what you're suggesting is that by handling the exceptions at a higher level, we can provide more domain specific errors (FlavorNotFound over NotFound and so on). I can see this making the error output a bit easier to read and understand.

The intent of this change is to help make the rpc API a bit easier to

1) Add a Connection class in nova.rpc.common which defines the public
interface of the connection returned by nova.rpc.create_connection().
Update the existing implementations to inherit from this class.

2) Add documentation for the public methods in nova.rpc.

3) Rename get_impl() to __get_impl() in nova.rpc.  This function is a
private implemenation detail and should not be used outside of this

http://libguestfs.org/ provides both utilities and libraries
to manipulate image files containing various operating systems.
It supports various image file formats and so will expand
the formats and guest types supported by openstack.
It does have extra overhead in that it starts a VM to
access the image. This has both advantages and disadvantages.
Also qemu-nbd is not supported on some systems like RHEL 6.

* nova/virt/disk/api.py (img_handlers): Add guestfs to the default
list of access methods to try, to act as a fallback.
* nova/virt/disk/guestfs.py: A new plugin class to provide support
for libguestfs mounting.
Note we use the guestmount utility, as a non root user,
so the user will need the ability to use fusermount, which
is often provided by being a member of the 'fuser' group.
In future we might use the guestfs python module to give
greater granularity of control over the image.

A foreign key constraint needs to be removed in order to succeed in the
DB migration. An earlier submitted fix for this uses a mysql drop
statement. I think it's cleaner to use sqlalchemy to do this, as it's
done this way in other version migrations as well. Fix for bug 907254.

Update: IBM from 1928 called, they want their 80 CPL limit
back. - on a more serious note, fixed jenkins PEP8 failure

Update4: Add myself to the Authors file

Fixes bug 906636.

The cisco plugin included ncclient, but does not use it when testing.
The openvswitch plugin included SQLAlchemy which is already required
by quantum itself.

I've also changed the install_venv.py script to only look at
tools/pip-requires, so that it behaves more like the rest of the
OpenStack projects.  In Jenkins that's the only file we look at
to see if we need to rebuild the virtualenv, so it would be best
if the project only hade one pip-requires.

Also added .gitignore to ignore files created during testing.

Change exception.VolumeIsBusy to derive from NovaException instead of
Error, so that an 'unexpected keyword' exception is not thrown when
the exception is raised with keyword parameters.

Add unit test to confirm that the 'unexpected keyword' exception is not
thrown when the exception is raised by nova.volume.driver.VolumeDriver

Responded to reviewer observations, fix pep8 errors in tset_volume.py,
added email address to Authors file.

That may be the only place they exist.\n\nShould we remove the current context.is_admin checks from the admin extensions and figure out a way to specify this at a higher level?  Maybe it's an argument to find_factory() that gets passed to extension __init__()s?  There'd be a number of __init__ methods to change... and it feels somewhat hacky (hmm.. somewhat), so I don't know about it.

http://libguestfs.org/ provides both utilities and libraries
to manipulate image files containing various operating systems.
It supports various image file formats and so will expand
the formats and guest types supported by openstack.
It does have extra overhead in that it starts a VM to
access the image. This has both advantages and disadvantages.
Also qemu-nbd is not supported on some systems like RHEL 6.

* nova/virt/disk/base.py (img_handlers): Add guestfs to the default
list of access methods to try, to act as a fallback.
* nova/virt/disk/guestfs.py: A new plugin class to provide support
for libguestfs mounting.
Note we use the guestmount utility, as a non root user,
so the user will need the ability to use fusermount, which
is often provided by being a member of the 'fuser' group.
In future we might use the guestfs python module to give
greater granularity of control over the image.

Rather than providing two mutually exlusive image
access methods (loop and qemu-nbd), try each in turn.
This is to prepare for a follow up patch which will
add libguestfs as a method to try.

* nova/virt/mount.py: A new Mount class to abstract the
devce allocation, partition mapping and file sys mounting,
for each access type.
* nova/virt/disk/loop.py: A specialization of the base Mount class
to provide loop back mounting support.
* nova/virt/disk/nbd.py: A specialization of the base Mount class
to provide qemu-nbd mounting support.
* nova/virt/disk/api.py: A new file containing the nova.virt.disk
module interface.
(img_handlers): A new list of access methods to try,
with the order being honored.
(_DiskImage): An internal helper class that uses the plugin classes
above, to provide the operations available on a disk image file.
When mounting, iterate over each access method until one succeeds.
If a hint is provided about a CoW format image, the list of
methods to try will be reduced accordingly.
Note expected errors are no longer raised as exceptions during mounting.
Instead, on failure to mount an image, errors are collated and raised.
Interveining errors are logged in debug mode for successful mounts.
* nova/virt/libvirt/connection.py: Adjust the function parameter
names to be more general, rather than referencing specific
implementations like 'nbd' and 'tune2fs'.
Simplify the destroy_container() by storing and passing
back a reference to the _DiskImage object, which has the
necessary state to unmount.
* nova/utils.py (trycmd): A helper function to both deal with,
commands that issue ignorable warnings to stderr,
and commands that EXIT_SUCCESS while issuing errors to stderr.
nova/virt/xenapi/vm_utils.py: Adjust for the moved virt.disk package

Scheduler error handler was looking for instance_id when it may or may
not exist.  Added the proper code for it to determine whether the
instance was actually created in the DB or not and how to find its ID.

Note: there's some pretty nasty stuff in here, but unavoidable without
larger changes.  I'd like to hold off on these larger changes, because
the problem should be solved with some of the scalability work coming.

Adds test cases that verify the bug behaviour.

Adds some logic to the main API images controller
update() method that does the following:

* If an image file is being uploaded, do not purge
  existing properties when updating metadata. The idea
  behind this change is that a very common scenario is
  to register an image entry with Glance with some
  properties (like instance_uuid, instance_type, etc) and
  then immediately upload an image (usually snapshots).
  We don't want to mark deleted the originally-registered
  properties during the image upload, which was what was
  happening.

* Add ability to force Glance NOT to purge properties
  when calling PUT /images/<IMAGE_ID> if the
  X-Glance-Registry-Purge-Props: false
  header is passed.

I also worry about greenthreads stacking up in compute manager if something gets stuck.\n\nI do like the changes to _spawn.  I don't see much reason to wait for boot in the background... when the compute manager is already working on spawn in its own greenthread.  So, I see those changes wanted no matter what.  One difference in behavior is that now exceptions can be thrown and they'll carry back up to the callers of _spawn...  where I think the prior behavior caused them to be ignore.  I think this is better behavior and I thought Ewan had a patch for this, too, but this is a larger and better fix.\n\nMy initial instinct on how to fix this would have been to have 'delete' check to see if the instance is in a certain task_state and mark something in the DB that it should be deleted.  The certain task states could then check for this and delete the instance themselves if they see it.  Or... change delete to not actually do anything but mark the DB record as deleted.  Then a periodic task goes around deleting the instance when the task_state is in an appropriate state.

Adds test cases that verify the bug behaviour.

Adds some logic to the main API images controller
update() method that does the following:

* If an image file is being uploaded, do not purge
  existing properties when updating metadata. The idea
  behind this change is that a very common scenario is
  to register an image entry with Glance with some
  properties (like instance_uuid, instance_type, etc) and
  then immediately upload an image (usually snapshots).
  We don't want to mark deleted the originally-registered
  properties during the image upload, which was what was
  happening.

* Add ability to force Glance NOT to purge properties
  when calling PUT /images/<IMAGE_ID> if the
  X-Glance-Registry-Purge-Props: false
  header is passed.
