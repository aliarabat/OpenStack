puppet-ovn uses puppet-vswitch to configure the OVN params. When OVS binaries are

are part of the command output.

We see the error 'undefined method 'chomp' for nil:NilClass' when the result is
extracted. This patch fixes this issue by checking if the 'value' var is nil or
not before 'parse_column_value' is called.

Tripleo deployment with OVN is failing because of this issue.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements

on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the

These variable were initially  created and used while cleanup the
created resources in corresponding delete methods. But now those
delete methods has been switched to use addClassResourceCleanup.

Few test class still use them for list resources etc which is
hard to find that these were from base class and value is being

This adds a module that behaves like mock.sentinel, but that
returns UUIDs suitable for use in tests where we need that
specifically.

This code is from [1], but have some difference:
1. The enforced-singleton stuff is removed [2], and the
_UUIDSentinels class is private and a uuids instance is exposed.
2. Add some doc strings for it.

There is an alternate patch [2] in oslo.utils.

This module is used by Nova and Placement, so we extract it
into oslotest library.

This patchset adds a distinct group for each of the validation
methodologies:

  * oslo.policy approach => policy_validation
  * custom requirements approach => requirements_validation

policy_validation receives the following options:

  * custom_policy_files

requirements_validation receives the following options:

  * custom_requirements_file
  * test_custom_requirements

Background: In the initial Patrole spec for project creation submitted
to qa-specs [0] there is much discussion about oslo.policy-driven vs.
requirements-driven approach to RBAC validation. Long story short:
Patrole by default does oslo.policy validation but later added
requirements-driven validation [1]. However, the options for both
ways of doing validation should be made as distinct as possible to
avoid confusion between which options to use for which validation

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

Also change fetch-stestr-output to fetch-subunit-output, since the role

Make castellan-functional-devstack temporarily non-voting for now to be

Add a private _UUIDSentinels() class to oslo_utils.fixture that behaves
like a mock.sentinel, but returns specifically UUIDs. Expose a
(singleton) instance of it called uuidsentinel. This is mostly copied
from [1], with the following differences:

- We don't do the enforced-singleton thing [2]. But importing the
  uuidsentinel global yields the same behavior.
- We don't do the local import thing [3][4], because we're already in
  the right lib, so no issues with circular imports.
- Locking is added to make this threadsafe. (See discussion at [5])

Note that there is some question as to whether it is more appropriate
for this to live here or in oslotest [6]. This has been discussed on the
dev ML [7] and it was concluded [8] that it should live here.

The local request start and end times (combined with jitter, if
provided) define a window of tolerable remote times. When the remote
time falls outside of that window, output the delta to get *within* the
window rather than the delta to get *to the end* of the window.

Additionally, output both the starting and ending local time if they
format differently; this avoids confusing output when the request takes
a while to complete and the remote has a time before the local time.

To check affinity and anti-affinity policies for scheduling instances,
we use the RequestSpec.instance_group.hosts field to check the hosts
that have group members on them. Access of the 'hosts' field calls
InstanceGroup.get_hosts during a lazy-load and get_hosts does a query
for all instances that are members of the group and returns their hosts
after removing duplicates. The InstanceList query isn't targeting any
cells, so it will return [] in a multi-cell environment in both the
instance create case and the instance move case. In the move case, we
do have a cell-targeted RequestContext when setup_instance_group is
called *but* the RequestSpec.instance_group object is queried early in
compute/api before we're targeted to a cell, so a call of
RequestSpec.instance_group.get_hosts() will result in [] still, even
for move operations.

This makes setup_instance_group query all cells for instances that are
members of the instance group if the RequestContext is untargeted, else
it queries the targeted cell for the instances.

DiscoveryFailures can happen for a variety of reasons, ranging
from service misconfiguration to a keystone outage to a transient
network failure. If we don't catch and handle the failure here,
it will almost certainly cause something further up the WSGI stack
to send a 500 Internal Error (and likely log a traceback).

A log line like

    Unable to validate token: Could not find versioned identity
    endpoints when attempting to authenticate. Please check that
    your auth_url is correct. Unable to establish connection to
    http://keystone:35357: HTTPConnectionPool(host='keystone',

should be plenty enough for an operator to assess the situation;
I don't need a 29-frame traceback.

There was a eventlet.monkey_patch [1] when we launch a nova
process(like nova-api, nova-compute), but it's invalid under
the uwsgi mode.

But there are concurrency requirements in the api service, such
as, when listing instances cross multiple cells we're using
greenthreads and oslo.db does a time.sleep to allow switching
greenthreads [2].

So, in this patch we add the monkey_patch in the uwsgi
application setup and refactor the monkey patching to use common
code.

Before we stored flavors in instance_extra, certain fields, defined
in nova.compute.flavors.system_metadata_flavor_props, were stored
in the instance.system_metadata for the embedded instance.flavor.
The ""disabled"" field wasn't one of those keys, however, so really
old instances that had their embedded flavor converted to the
serialized instance_extra form won't have the disabled attribute
set and we need to default those here so callers, like the
versioned notfication FlavorPayload, don't explode trying to load
instance.flavor.disabled.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are

The changes to allow configuration of more rndc options had a
cross-repo dependency on the tripleo-heat-templates changes that
made use of the new options.  Unfortunately, the puppet changes
landed first and are now broken because necessary inputs are not
being provided.  This change conditionalizes the new configurations
so that if the parameters aren't passed we won't attempt to do
invalid configuration.

The time has come.

These filters haven't been necessary since Ocata [1]
when the filter scheduler started using placement
to filter on VCPU, DISK_GB and MEMORY_MB. The
only reason to use them with any in-tree scheduler
drivers is if using the CachingScheduler which doesn't
use placement, but the CachingScheduler itself has
been deprecated since Pike [2]. Furthermore, as of
change [3] in Stein, the ironic driver no longer
reports vcpu/ram/disk inventory for ironic nodes
which will make these filters filter out ironic nodes
thinking they don't have any inventory. Also, as
noted in [4], the DiskFilter does not account for
volume-backed instances and may incorrectly filter
out a host based on disk inventory when it would
otherwise be OK if the instance is not using local
disk.

The related aggregate filters are left intact for
now, see blueprint placement-aggregate-allocation-ratios.

This bug was previously fixed but the fix did not cover all cases. This
issue is still present if an IP address other than 127.0.0.1 or the
admin IP address (but not the internal API IP address, which is correct)
is in /etc/hosts. For example, in CI we often see 127.0.1.1.

This change removes all entries from /etc/hosts for the host's current
hostname, other than the internal API IP address. It also adds a call to
rabbitmqctl status to verify that the change has worked.

Related: We ought to improve the kolla ansible prechecks to catch the
case when there is more than one IP address mapping for the host's
current hostname.

Fix ironic inspector rule registration

Use a specific inspector API version (1.12, the latest in Queens) to
ensure that new releases of ironic inspector don't break rule
registration.

This was happening because the client object created in the
os_ironic_inspector_rule module uses the maximum API version known to
the client.

Add missing Kolla Ansible group ironic-ipxe

Support for ipxe was backported to the default stackhpc/pike branch of
kolla ansible, so we need to at least define the group here.

---

Fix permissions of kolla-ansible target virtualenv

When using a target virtual environment for kolla-ansible [1], it is possible
to get a Permission Denied error. This can occur if the permissions of
/opt/kayobe or /opt/kayobe/venvs are restricted to the stack user (0700), since
kolla ansible uses the kolla user.

Although it makes sense for /opt/kayobe/venvs/kayobe to be 0700, /opt/kayobe
and /opt/kayobe/venvs should be 0755 to allow the kolla user to access a
virtualenv in /opt/kayobe/venvs/kolla-ansible.

This was seen during deployment of a seed, with kayobe target virtualenvs [2]
also in use. Since the kayobe-target-venv.yml playbook is one of the first
playbooks to be run, it will create the /opt/kayobe and /opt/kayobe/venvs
directories, and set the permissions correctly.

We've seen a recent issue that suggest direct IO support checks can fail
in other valid ways than EINVAL, namely, failures with ENOENT or the
FileNotFoundError exception, which is a Python 3-only exception type,
can occur. While we can't test for this without breaking Python 2.7
support, we can mimic this by looking for checking for the errno
attribute of the OSError exception. Do this.

This makes the instance_list module support batching across cells
with a couple of different strategies, and with room to add more
in the future.

Before this change, an instance list with limit 1000 to a
deployment with 10 cells would generate a query to each cell
database with the same limit. Thus, that API request could end
up processing up to 10,000 instance records despite only
returning 1000 to the user (because of the limit).

This uses the batch functionality in the base code added in
Iaa4759822e70b39bd735104d03d4deec988d35a1
by providing a couple of strategies by which the batch size
per cell can be determined. These should provide a lot of gain
in the short term, and we can extend them with other strategies
as we identify some with additional benefits.

This patch modifies the code paths for the non-granular request group
allocation candidates processing. It removes the giant multi-join SQL
query and replaces it with multiple calls to
_get_providers_with_resource(), logging the number of matched providers
for each resource class requested and filter (on required traits,
forbidden traits and aggregate memebership).

Here are some examples of the debug output:

- A request for three resources with no aggregate or trait filters:

 found 7 providers with available 5 VCPU
 found 9 providers with available 1024 MEMORY_MB
 found 5 providers after filtering by previous result
 found 8 providers with available 1500 DISK_GB
 found 2 providers after filtering by previous result

- The same request, but with a required trait that nobody has, shorts
  out quickly:

 found 0 providers after applying required traits filter (['HW_CPU_X86_AVX2'])

- A request for one resource with aggregates and forbidden (but no
  required) traits:

 found 2 providers after applying aggregates filter ([['3ed8fb2f-4793-46ee-a55b-fdf42cb392ca']])
 found 1 providers after applying forbidden traits filter ([u'CUSTOM_TWO', u'CUSTOM_THREE'])
 found 3 providers with available 4 VCPU
 found 1 providers after applying initial aggregate and trait filters

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

This is a minor refactor with no functional change that will make
the next patch easier. If we're not limiting cell scope during an
instance list, we just let context.scatter_gather_all_cells() load
and use the global list of cells. Since we will want to count
those cells and adjust the batch size, we might as well just always
pass in the list of cells, which will either be a subset or all
of them.

Currently, we cannot get ACCEPT packet log because there are some
changed related to ovs firewall code since ovs firewall logging has
been merged.

Regarding to performance perspective, we only log first accepted packet.
So we only need to forward first accepted packet of each connection
session to table 91 and table 92.

So this patch fixes these issues.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

The changes to allow configuration of more rndc options had a
cross-repo dependency on the tripleo-heat-templates changes that
made use of the new options.  Unfortunately, the puppet changes
landed first and are now broken because necessary inputs are not
being provided.  This change conditionalizes the new configurations
so that if the parameters aren't passed we won't attempt to do

When using SSH client to execute a command a Paramiko

This produces a leak of SSH connections. It also slow

  going to return the same Paramiko client instance
  until close() method is called.

- close() method allows to close paramiko client socket and
  release resources.

- execute_script() spawn a script interpreter (Bash by default) on
  a remote machinge to execute a script provided as a string.
  For convenience by default it combines STDOUT and STDERR to LOG
  an human friendly message when the script fails.

Recent changes in tenacity have broken how we mock the wait call for the
test. This change mocks out the inspect.getargspec call that is used in
tenacity to fix our unit tests for now. I think it might be beneficial
to not actually test the retry functionality in the tripleo-common unit
tests as it seems to be more of a test for tenacity than tripleo-common.

Recent changes in tenacity have broken how we mock the wait call for the test.
This change mocks out the inspect.getargspec call that is used in tenacity to
fix our unit tests for now. I think it might be beneficial to not actually test
the retry functionality in the paunch unit tests as it seems to be more
of a test for tenacity than paunch.

All other roles have their pip_packages in defaults/main.yml
and the lists were all in vars/main.yml before [1] was
implemented. Since then, the py_pkgs lookup does not recognise
that neutron has the project_group of 'neutron_all', but
instead thinks it is in 'all'. This mismatches the git
repo project group, resulting in a failed repo build if the
group is not populated. It also results in neutron packages
building even if neutron is not configured to be part of the
build.

This patch moves the vars back to vars/main.yml to restore
proper functioning of the repo build and correct association
with the project group.

These vars are not used by the distro install process, so it
does not matter where they're sourced.

All other roles have their pip_packages in defaults/main.yml
and the lists were all in vars/main.yml before [1] was
implemented. Since then, the py_pkgs lookup does not recognise
that neutron has the project_group of 'neutron_all', but
instead thinks it is in 'all'. This mismatches the git
repo project group, resulting in a failed repo build if the
group is not populated. It also results in neutron packages
building even if neutron is not configured to be part of the
build.

This patch moves the vars back to vars/main.yml to restore
proper functioning of the repo build and correct association
with the project group.

These vars are not used by the distro install process, so it
does not matter where they're sourced.

Most jobs run with python3 now by default.

In addition, this commit moves bandit testenv definitions
before non-testenv tox environments. I believe this brings
better readability.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.
