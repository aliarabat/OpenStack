If an incoming request to placement does not set the accept header
force it to 'application/json'. This not only ensures that error
responses are in JSON but also that errors early in the middleware
stack do not cause a key error (see the #1724065 bug).

This fix is done by checking headers early in the middleware stack
using the requestlog middleware as a convenient place to do the
check. This overloads requestlog's purpose, but avoids adding yet
more middleware (doing so has some small impact per request).

Fixing bug 1724065 fixes a 500. Fixing bug 1674694 changes (for some
requests) the content type of the bodies of 400-499 responses. This
creates a bit of quandry for microversion handling. If a microversion
is considered required here then it's not clear the global fix is
worth doing and the 500 fix should be limited the microversion
middleware. The intent all along has been that responses should
strive to align with the API-WG errors guideline [1], which assumes
application/json.

Before this change, DVR_SNAT agents would get no routers when
asking for updates due to provisioning of DHCP ports on the
node they are running on. This means that there's no connectivity
between the DHCP port and the network gateway (that may be
hosted on a different node), and therefore things like DNS may
break when a VM attempts resolution when talking to the affected
DHCP port.

This change relaxed a conditional that prevents the right list of
routers to be compiled and returned from the server to the agent.
The agent on the other hand needs to make sure to allocate the
right type of router based on what is being returned from the server.

In a number of places in resource_provider.py, we're checking for
DBDuplicateError after running conn.execute(). And ""conn"" is an
SQLAlchemy Connection object. The issue is that DBDuplicateError is not
an SQLAlchemy exception. Instead, it is an oslo_db-specific exception
that is used to mask differences between DB drivers that variably return
an OperationalError or an IntegrityError when a duplicate key is found
[1].

In practice, what this means is that all calling locations that use the
straight ""conn.execute()"" calling sequence cannot rely on catching
DBDuplicateError (because SQLAlchemy's Connection.execute() method will
never raise it). Instead, all of those calling locations needed to be
updated to use context.session.execute() instead. This allows
DBDuplicateError to be caught properly.

In addition, all the manual construction of transactions in
resource_provider.py that did:

 with conn.begin()

needed to have those manual begin() calls removed. The reason is that
oslo_db's Session object (which is what is injected by the enginefacade
into the nova.context.RequestContext) automatically handles creation,
commit and rollback of transactions based on whether the source
entrypoint is a writer or reader context.

As explained in bug [1] when l3 agent fails to report state to the
server, its state is set to AGENT_REVIVED, triggering
fetch_and_sync_all_routers, which will set all its HA network ports
to DOWN, resulting in
1) ovs agent rewiring these ports and setting status to ACTIVE
2) when these ports are active, server sends router update to l3 agent
As server, ovs and l3 agents are busy with this processing, l3 agent
may fail again reporting state, repeating this process.

As l3 agent is repeatedly processing same routers, SIGHUPs are
frequently sent to keepalived, resulting in multiple masters.

To fix this, we call update_all_ha_network_port_statuses in l3 agent
start instead of calling from fetch_and_sync_all_routers.

Make py27 and py35 versions of the tips job, and a project-template to
hold them so it's easy for other projects to use both (or more, we ever
add them) The base tox job knows how to install siblings based on
required-projects, which makes it easy to piggyback on them.

Remove the irrelevant-files sections, as these are specified in the
base openstack-tox jobs.

Using the unit-tips or functional-tips tox env is no longer neccessary.
For the gate it's actually important to not do the sibling processing by
hand in tox as the base tox job version of the logic does all the
right things to deal with constraints and whatnot. Leave them for local
developer convenience.

Leave the osc-tox-unit-tips job for now, since there are some other
repos using it. Once we switch them to the template, we can remove the
job.

When an instance is deleted the allocation of that instance is freed
after the instance is destroyed in the db. The functional tests that
asserting resource allocation after instance delete are waiting for
the instance to disappear from the REST API. This made such tests
racy.

Fortunately the instance.delete.end notification is emitted after
the instance allocation is freed. This patch fixes the race in the
test by waiting for the instance.delete.end notification before
asserting that the allocation is freed properly.

This commit fixes the directory tree appearance in document. It looks
like that the original rst line blocks don't work in the current
renderer. As a result, the directory structure is a little difficult to
understand. So, this commit use a literal block instead of that as a
quick fix.

to prevent it from holding the epmd port.

The current way of searching for non-containerized epmd is broken in
case lsns returns an error. Use pgrep's namespace filtering instead.

The osc-functional-devstack-tips job runs unit tests only, and only
installs python-openstackclient from master.  We really need to include
osc-lib as much of the cliff interfaces in OSC are there.

Also, since unit tests often mock things out from other packages, the
functional tests are better at finding integration issues.  OSC has some
'integration' tests in its unit test suite that use the full client stack,
mocking out calls at the HTTP REST layer so those are still useful too.

We will add a unit test -tips style job to OSC that can be consumed here.

load balancer to be left in ERROR. This patch resolves those two code paths

This patch starts a neutron_lib.api.converters sub-package to allow API
defintions the ability to create converters spcific to their defintion
(for example the convert_protocol in [1]). All generic converters will
remain in neutron_lib.api.converters.__init__ which is backwards
compatibile. This is the same approach we took with validators.

We have reasons to believe there is a correlation between DNS lookup
failures we are seeing in the gate and the very low TTL of some
domains.

Since jobs are running on ephemeral nodes which wouldn't be impacted
by stale cache, enforce a minimum TTL of 900 (15 minutes) for DNS
records in the local Unbound configuration.
This means that a domain with a TTL of 60 seconds will be cached for
15 minutes instead.

This will lead to less queries which is less prone to failure and rate
limiting by recursive DNS providers.

We do not need tox_install.sh, pip can handle constraints itself
and install the project correctly. Thus update tox.ini and remove
the now obsolete tools/tox_install.sh file.

This follows https://review.openstack.org/#/c/508061 to remove
tools/tox_install.sh.

This commit fixes the command line that gets created when a TLS
everywhere deployment is requested.
We pass to the deploy command line th file named
docker-services-tls-everywhere.yam but this should not be used anymore.
It doesn't exists anymore upstream and in addition if it's declared on
the command line AFTER the docker-ha.yml all the HA stuff breaks and the
deploy fails, because it tries to deploy overcloud HA services as docker
but they need instead pacemaker bundles.

Networking-ovn ML2 mechanism driver now supports binding of
direct(SR-IOV) ports. Traffic Control(TC) hardware offload framework
for SR-IOV VFs was introduced in Linux kernel 4.8.
Open vSwitch(OVS) 2.8 supports offloading OVS datapath rules using
the TC framework. By using OVS version 2.8 and Linux kernel >= 4.8,
a SR-IOV VF can be controlled via Openflow control plane.

networking-ovn mech driver binds a vnic_direct port only when the user
requests --binding-profile '{""capabilities"": [""switchdev""]}'. This is so
that networking-ovn and sriovnicswitch mech drivers works in the same set-up.

Currently when the blacklist_file and regex string is provided,
the constructed regex looks like '^((?!black1|black2|...).)*$regex'.
This is incorrect, as it will match nothing - some string
is expected after end of the line [denoted as $ in the regex].

The proper construction is like ^(?!black1|black2|...).*(regex).*$
This solves the issue with Tempest, where using blacklist for smoke
tests is not working now, as it leads into the issue described above.

Old pci_devices records might not have a uuid value set
and when we load those out of the database, the
PciDevice._from_db_object code was blindly trying to set
the PciDevice.uuid field to None, which fails because the
PciDevice.uuid field is not nullable.

This change fixes the problem by skipping the 'uuid' field
if it's not set in the db record so that we can auto-generate
a uuid later and update the object with it, which also performs
our online data migration.

This is similar to how we handle the uuid online migration for
other objects like compute nodes, services and migrations.

This patch adds support for API microversion 3.16, which allows us to
pass --cluster optional argument to migration and manage operations.

For this, a new type of CLI argument is added, the mutually exclusive
arguments that can be used similarly to the utils.arg decorator, but
with utils.exclusive_arg decorator.

Test runner polls neutron-server for agents for default value of
wait_until_true() which is 60 seconds. It has been proven to be
insufficient time on busy environments. This patch bumps the timeout to
3 minutes and also highers polling interval from 1 seconds to 10
seconds, to offload neutron-server.

Note that we still maintains the stable branches so

we expect the unit tests to have other mocks on top of these mocks. This
does not work, at least not with autospec. The resulting 2nd-level mocks
end up being mocks of mocks, with assert_* methods mocked.

Instead, use fixtures and create mocks only once in setUp.

We calculate migration case, based on current hosts and instance

Because 'cpu_util' and 'compute.node.cpu.percent', 'memory.resident'

So change the method to calculate the hosts workload.
The hypervisor workload of each node should be calculated by
summing up workload of all VMs on each node.

Before an upgrade, we have these type of entries in the db.

MariaDB [nova]> SELECT id, host, `binary`, deleted, version FROM services;
+----+--------------+--------------------+---------+---------+
| id | host         | binary             | deleted | version |
+----+--------------+--------------------+---------+---------+
|  5 | r1-n-os-api  | nova-osapi_compute | 0       |      16 |
| 21 | r1-n-m-api   | nova-metadata      | 0       |      16 |

The wsgi files we run basically boil down to something like

  NAME=metadata
  return wsgi_app.init_application(NAME)

In the wsgi_app.py we see this function

  service_ref = objects.Service.get_by_host_and_binary(ctxt, host, name)

Which results in a really big query, which again comes down to

  SELECT host, `binary` FROM services
    WHERE host = 'r1-n-m-api' AND `binary` == 'metadata'

No results. service_ref is set to None. Carry on.

  if service_ref:
    #Nope.
  else:
    try:
      ...
      service_obj.host = host
      service_obj.binary = 'nova-%s' % name
      service_obj.create()

Which results in a INSERT statement something like this;

  INSERT INTO services(host, `binary`, report_count, disabled, deleted, version)
    VALUES ('r1-n-m-api', 'nova-metadata', 0, 0, 0, 22)

  ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry 'r1-n-m-api-nova-metadata-0' for key 'uniq_services0host0binary0deleted'

So the first suggested fix is to prepend 'nova-' to the name, and make both
queries ask for 'nova-metadata'.  There's also a check that it doesn't start
with 'nova-', incase someone decides to prepend 'nova-' to the NAME= in the
wsgi-file. Which migth be a litte overkill, but just a safeguard none the less.

The stable:follows-policy tag is meant to provide information
about components of an OpenStack cloud, but does not apply so
well to downstream packaging or lifecycle management tools,
where the expectations are different[1].

This proposal recenters the tag on those ""cloud software""
components, and removes the expectation that lifecycle management
tools or SDKs are expected to get that tag to show maturity.

If this is approved, the ""Software Navigator"" on openstack.org
will be updated so that missing that tag no longer adversely
affects the maturity score of deployment tools.

Currently including the provision/remote role without intending to

Ideally, we would be able to include it dynamically so that the
tasks are not evaluated at compile time, but instead only if they
are run. This would require a pretty large refactor though, because
playbooks can not be included dynamically.

Instead, we can make sure to have a default for the lookup so that
it will not fail to evaluate. The task would still fail to run if
the lookup falls back to the default, so we wont hide issues with
the key not existing with this change.

This change removes the External network from the Networker
role, since it is not used or needed on that role.

The External network appers in the NIC config templates for the
Networker role, but this network is not used by the Networker
role. This results in deployment errors, since no IP address
is created for the External network, and the Networker roles
cannot reach an external gateway.

update the pypy job to run on fedora-26 instead, which has a new enough

not, it registers one. This is a race condition. If multiple

will succeed. The fix is to catch InvalidArgument fault from

Release notes should not need installation in order to build, so this
unnecessary version setting needs to be removed.

In the baremetal deployment, we used to ensure that neutron-server was
started prior to starting up the various agents. In the containerized
deployment we need to ensure that we launch the agents after the server
has been started. We can do this by configuring a start_order for each
of the services.

It should be noted that the ovs agent was actually configured to start
in step5 on baremetal due to previous race conditions under HA
deployments. This change leaves it in step4 but configures the
start_order to be after the neutron-api service.

It is not very easy to add the lazyloading again without a big
change in the architecture due to the dependence of these
components.  For those relationships that require to be there,
they will use `subquery` which will send much less data over

Release notes are version independent, so remove version/release
values. We've found that projects now require the service package
to be installed in order to build release notes, and this is entirely
due to the current convention of pulling in the version information.

Release notes should not need installation in order to build, so this
unnecessary version setting needs to be removed.

This is needed for new release notes publishing, see

This fixes the two points in the note at the top of the
flavors page:

1. The policy rule in the first bullet was old so it's updated.

2. As of Ifa4e9cdfbbac1a1d4bf28679b24a17b13f637ddd in Pike,
   Horizon no longer allows you to 'edit' a flavor by default.
   Rather than try to explain historical bad behavior and the
   new default behavior in the Dashboard, the second bullet is
   simply removed.

s390x architecture uses zipl as bootloader. When used in combination
with the vm element it replaces the existing bootloader element.
It's mandatory for s390x vm images.

Use cases
---------

* Allow users to create s390x images that run on nova with s390x
  libvirt/kvm backend
* Building nodepool images for s390x third party CI

Supported Distros
-----------------
The following listing shows all Distros that officially support
s390x and how those Distros are supported in DIB with this patch.

* SLES - not supported (SLES is not supported in DIB)
* RHEL - not suppoprted (RHEL is not supported as KVM guest on s390x,
                         therefore there's no rhel7 qcow image for s390x available
                         like it is for other archictectures)
* Ubuntu - supported

Ubuntu images can for example be built using the following commands:

  $ disk-image-create ubuntu-minimal zipl vm
  $ disk-image-create ubuntu-minimal zipl
  $ disk-image-create ubuntu zipl vm

Testing
-------

Cross architecture building of s390x images is not supported so far.

The plan is to set up a ThirdParty CI that builds the image for s390x and
provides the logs.

As explained in bug [1] when l3 agent fails to report state to the
server, its state is set to AGENT_REVIVED, triggering
fetch_and_sync_all_routers, which will set all its HA network ports
to DOWN, resulting in
1) ovs agent rewiring these ports and setting status to ACTIVE
2) when these ports are active, server sends router update to l3 agent
As server, ovs and l3 agents are busy with this processing, l3 agent
may fail again reporting state, repeating this process.

As l3 agent is repeatedly processing same routers, SIGHUPs are
frequently sent to keepalived, resulting in multiple masters.

To fix this, we call update_all_ha_network_port_statuses in l3 agent
start instead of calling from fetch_and_sync_all_routers.

The drivers_private_data is expected to be able to
save new entries using the same keys as previously deleted
entries.

Before performing an update, it retrieves all entries
related to the same entity to check if it needs to
perform an update (including on deleted entries) or a
new insertion.

Unfortunately, the misinterpretation of a parameter in the
manila DB API led to a bug that prevented deleted entries
to be retrieved.

This bugfix replaces the query ensuring that all entries
(active and deleted) are retrieved so the update validation
works.

In order to support compute services ppc64le, which currently don't
have supported methods for building and distributing container images,
we create a role 'ComputeAlt' which directly uses the puppet/services
templates to configure services that would typically be containers.

This new role is supposed to minimally diverge from the Compute role.

The following services have been switch for the puppet versions:
 - OS::TripleO::Services::ComputeCeilometerAgent
 - OS::TripleO::Services::ComputeNeutronOvsAgent
 - OS::TripleO::Services::Iscsid
 - OS::TripleO::Services::NeutronSriovAgentAlt
 - OS::TripleO::Services::NovaCompute
 - OS::TripleO::Services::NovaLibvirt
 - OS::TripleO::Services::NovaMigrationTarget

The following services have been removed as they're only available as
docker containers:
 - OS::TripleO::Services::Docker
 - OS::TripleO::Services::ContainersLogrotateCrond

Alternate versions for the following services are configured, they are
left as OS::Heat::None the operator will need to define them
appropriately if they're needed:
 - OS::TripleO::Services::Collectd
 - OS::TripleO::Services::FluentdClient
 - OS::TripleO::Services::SensuClient
 - OS::TripleO::Services::OVNController

NOTE(tonyb): This differs from the queens version as:
 - Idb9886f04d56ffc75a78c4059ff319b58b4acf9f
   (logging: merge fluentd-client and fluentd-base)
 - I2c54acaaa820961c936f1fbe304f42162f720496
   (Add rsyslog-sidecar resource and configuration)

Doing this was useful for playing with Kubespray, but it's suboptimal
for multiple reasons:

1. It gets generated into artifacts directory which we collect for CI
   logs. It has around 220 megabytes, which would be very bad for log
   collection space usage. Even if Kubespray made the location
   configurable, mistral user's external_deploy_tasks don't have
   rights to write it e.g. into /usr/local/bin, so usefulness of doing
   this at all is questionable.

2. Kubectl on the undercloud, it would ideally be preinstalled via
   RPMs rather than relying on the respective COE installers to
   produce one by fetching it from the overcloud.

In order to support live migrating instances placed on Cluster
Shared Volumes, we must explicitly tell os-win whether disks will
be migrated or not, ensuring that the right live migration type
will be requested.

Otherwise, the live migration will fail, Hyper-V complaining that
it could not move the instance disks (although this operation would
not be necessary).

Note that this was not a problem with other forms of shared storage

This adds more testing so we're doing everything we can combat
regressions across distros and all of our storage backends. To enure the
greatest possibility of consistent success when running the container prep
process the build timeout has been doubled for both SUSE and Cent.

For the SUSE prep-process the dbus-1 package has been added to the
installation list. This is being done for consistency across the distros
we support.

The hard-coded choices for the server group policy make it impossible
to create a server group with the soft-affinity or
soft-anti-affinity policy rules which were added in compute API
microversion 2.15. This removes the hard-coded choices so that the
policy is restricted on the server side rather than the client side.
