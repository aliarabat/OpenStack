DNM: testing without the ban/unban dance.

When upgrading rabbitmq to a new major version, the cluster cannot be
reform correctly as the old and the new version cannot talk to each
other.

The algorithm used here is to solve the problem is:

 0. if the current version is 3.6 we are going to upgrade it to 3.7,
    so save that an upgrade of rabbitmq is coming.

 1. if an upgrade of rabbitmq is coming: if no ban exists then I'm the
    first rabbitmq node to be updated to the next major version, ban the
    others at step 5 of the update of that node.

 2. if bans exists, then I'm not the first one and then I'm un-banning
    myself during the step 5 of the update as well. We ""by-pass"" paunch
    here. But given the image manipulations done to HA containers during
    update tasks we don't need paunch to pull the new images. Effectively
    we will start with the new rabbitmq that will happily rejoin the
    cluster ever-after. No new puppet configuration is necessary for this
    new rabbitmq version so we can skip it as well.

    Note that we un-ban without checking if a update of rabbitmq is
    coming. This is to cover the case of a restarted update or an updated
    used with --limit.

With this, the first rabbitmq node updated will be the only one
running and will start properly. After, only updated nodes will rejoin
the cluster avoiding any error.

There will be a short cut in the control plane as we need to modify
the rabbitmq bundle resource to add the UTF-8 support.

There will be also a degraded rabbitmq cluster state during which only
one, then two rabbitmq nodes will be available. It depends on many
things but we can says that there will be only one rabbitmq node
during ~30 minutes and then it will be running with two nodes only
during ~30 minutes more.

Rabbitmq 2.7 is sensitive to the locale used, so we need to make sure
that every puppet call is made in an UTF-8 environment.

What we have added here, is a adapted backport of:
 - https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/+/649299/
 - https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/+/649697/

With this, the rabbitmq containers and puppet are running in a UTF-8
environment, preventing any puppet error during common deploy step
phase of the update.

Those reviews need their counterpart in puppet-tripleo so that the
rabbitmq bundle resource get properly configured to use UTF-8.

We also need to tweak the puppet module as mnesia won't be necessarily
in a cluster state (as described above) when the rabbitmq bootstrap
node is updated.

The last two points will be handled in two reviews in
puppet-tripleo. See the ""Depends On"" which is the tip of the changes.

We've noticed that centos8 arm64 images have a root devices of
/dev/mapper/loop7p3 which make sense within a dib image build context
but not at boot time. Dib intends to use labels to set the root device
but when efi is used we end up running grub2-mkconfig against the efi
grub config path before we configure grub to use labels.

Fix this by running grub2-mkconfig after its configuration is set.
This should avoid confusion and complicated paths through the scripts
that configure this for us. We then copy the resulting config to the efi
specific grub.cfg location for platforms that have it.

There is also a small refactoring that is done to try and make the ~3
boot variants more clear:

 1) Booting with legacy bios
 2) Booting with uefi without a signed shim that directly calls grub
 3) Booting with uefi and a signed shim that calls grub

Options 1 and 2 share the /boot/grub*/grub.cfg file. Option 3 needs its
grub.cfg to live alongside distro specific efi target.

This commit makes the delete_router_port() method from OVNClient more
resilient to NotFound errors. Apart from the L3 plugin, this method is
also invoked by the maintenance task to fix stale/not-up-to-date objects
in the OVN database, and since the maintenance task runs every 5 minutes
only it could happen that some objects fetched by delete_router_port()
are gone by the moment that method is invoked.

When there is a directory '/boot/efi/$EFI_BOOT_DIR' it will generate
two grub.cfg files. One under this dir, the other under directory
'/boot/grub2/' or'/boot/grub/'.

But current bootloader element grub default overrides such as root
device override and console parameters appending only happen in the
latter grub.cfg. This might cause grub default overrides not working.
Because only the former grub.cfg will be used to boot OS here.

Lower-constraints is not a requirement of the OpenStack Python PTI
[0] and there currently is a discussion on the mailing list [1]
about dropping the test, with the oslo team already having done
so [2].

The new dependency resolver in pip fails due to incompatible
dependency versions in our lower-constraints file, meaning that
we were never providing any real guarantees with it.

To unblock the CI, I am disabling lower-constraints job for now,
with the option to reenable it in case we fix the constraints,
and based on the outcome of the mailing list discussions and
consensus.

Also, rename instance_id field to proper port_id.

Before this change, when instance_id was passed from the Instances
page in the URL, the information would be lost on form submission,
and if the form contained an error, the it would be redisplayed with
the port drop-down containing all ports from all instances. This also
made submitting this form slow, as the drop-down would be populated
with all ports on form validation.

It also creates a bug, where if there are more instances than Nova's
pagination allows, the ports from newer instances would no longer
appear in the drop-down, and the form would fail to validate, even
though the choice of port on initial form was correct.

A bug has been introduced to the which package in CentOS Stream 8 which
causes it to fail when used with the following bash options:

set -u
set -o pipefail

Then, when running which we see the following output:

environment: line 1: _declare: unbound variable

As found by Pierre, this seems to be caused by the implementation of
which as a bash function which references an unbound variable
(_declare). It's tracked in Fedora by
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1944877#.

This change works around the issue by using the /usr/bin/which binary.

We use Tempest master for testing the supported stable
branches, so using master upper constraints works fine for
such master or stable branch testing, but when we need to
use old Tempest in the below cases then master upper constraints
do not work for Tempest venv:
- Testing Extended Maintenance branch
- Testing py2.7 jobs until stable/train with in-tree tempest plugins

If heat integration test script does not use the master constraints
for Tempest (when any stable branch goes to Extended Maintenance state)
then we need to use the same constraints while running the tests too
otherwise, it will end up recreating the Tempest venv and remove the
already installed tempest plugins and their deps.

This commit set the compatible upper constraint
according to TEMPEST_VENV_UPPER_CONSTRAINTS variable, which is
what used in devstack while creating the Tempest venv and install
tempest plugins in that venv.

Currently, it is possible to ""partially archive"" the database by
running 'nova-manage db archive_deleted_rows' with --max_rows or by
interrupting the archive process in any way. When this happens, it is
possible to have archived a record with a foreign key relationship to a
parent record (example: 'instance_extra' table record is archived while
the 'instances' table record remains).

When an instance's records become ""split"" in this way, any API request
that can (1) access the deleted instance and (2) tries to access data
that should be in a child table (example: the embedded flavor for an
instance) will fail with an OrphanedObjectError and HTTP 500 to the
user. Examples of APIs that are affected by this are the tenant usage
APIs and listing of deleted instances as admin.

In the tenant usage example, the API looks at deleted instances to
calculate usage over a time period. It pulls deleted and non-deleted
instances and does instance.get_flavor() to calculate their usage. The
flavor data is expected to be present because
expecteds_attrs=['flavor'] is used to do a join with the
'instance_extra' table and populate the instance object's flavor data.
When get_flavor() is called, it tries to access the instance.flavor
attribute (which hasn't been populated because the 'instance_extra'
record is gone). That triggers a lazy-load of the flavor which loads
the instance from the database again with expected_attrs=['flavor']
again which doesn't populate instance.flavor (again) because the
'instance_extra' record is gone. Then the Instance._load_flavor code
intentionally orphans the instance record to avoid triggering
lazy-loads while it attempts to populate instance.flavor,
instance.new_flavor, and instance.old_flavor. Finally, another
lazy-load is triggered (because instance.flavor is still not populated)
and fails with OrphanedObjectError.

One way to solve this problem is to make it impossible for
archive_deleted_records to orphan records that are related by foreign
key relationships. The approach is to process parent tables first
(opposite of today where we process child tables first) and find all of
the tables that refer to it by foreign keys, create and collect
insert/delete statements for those child records, and then put them all
together in a single database transaction to archive all related
records ""atomically"". The idea is that if anything were to interrupt
the transaction (errors or other) it would roll back and keep all the
related records together. Either all or archived or none are archived.

This changes the logic of the per table archive to discover tables that
refer to the table by foreign keys and generates insert/delete query
statements to execute in the same database transaction as the table
archive itself. The extra records archived along with the table are
added to the rows_archived result. The existing code for ""archiving
records if instance is deleted"" also has to be removed along with this
because the new logic does the same thing dynamically and makes it
obsolete. Finally, some assertions in the unit tests need to be changed
or removed because they were assuming certain types of archiving
failures due to foreign key constraint violations that can no longer
occur with the new dynamic logic for archiving child records.

It seems lsof is a bit too heavy on the system when multiple
healthchecks are running in parallel.
So instead of calling a ""big"" process, let's split a bit things and get
to the filesystem directly in order to pick only the things we actually
need.

What changes:
- using /proc/net/{tcp,udp}, we get every socket matching the port
- using find with the right options, we can ensure at least one socket
  exists with the wanted inode(s)

The last part exits as soon as we have a match in order to make it
faster and less resource consuming.

This patch adds basic RBAC test for the Secret Stores API for
the reader, member and admin personas with project scope.

The tests are skipped by a config option, as they require
the multiple-backends feature to be enabled in barbican.

The devstack instace we're using for gate tests does not have
this enabled, so we default to False for now.

This change allows a user to forward control plane logs
directly to Elasticsearch from Fluentd, rather than via
the Monasca Log API when Monasca is enabled. The Monasca
Log API can continue to handle tenant logs.

For many use cases this is simpler, reduces resource
consumption and helps to decouple control plane logging
services from tenant logging services.

It may not always be desired, so is optional and off by
default.

(second try)

Currently mapping engine can map multiple projects for user (as stated in https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/pike/advanced-topics/federation/mapping_combinations.html), but this support
lacks from (a) dynamic mapping projects from assertion (for ex. projects ids are in assertion) and (b) mapping engine cannot map to list from assertion (if in asertion we have
""some_field"": [ id1, id2, ..., idN ] - then using this field by substitution - eg ""{1}"" wont map this to whole needed structure of projects in mapping).

In patch I extend mapping schema by adding new field ""projects_spec"" of type string.
This field contains string formated like

  project1ID:role1:role2:..:roleN,project2ID:role1:...:roleN,...

and this is mapped into proper structure { ""projects"": [  { ""id"": .., ""roles"": [ ... ] }, ... ] }
this allows the identity provider to supply permission-like informations about what projects user should have access to.

Also new configuration options has been added to more precisely control behavior of auto-provisioned projects.

The Log Metrics service is an admin only service. We now have
support in Fluentd via the Prometheus plugin to create metrics
from logs. These metrics can be scraped into Monasca or Prometheus.
It therefore makes sense to deprecate this service, starting by
disabling it by default, and then removing it in the Xena release.
This should improve the stability of the Monasca metrics pipeline
by ensuring that all metrics pass via the Monasca API for
validation, and ensure that metrics generated from logs are
available to both Prometheus and Monasca users by default.

branchless [1] (and tagless but that's already the case here).

They haven't been branched since ussuri, we think that we simply
missed to retire them few series ago.

I think that's the right moment to do a little spring cleaning.

Supermicro machines, when in UEFI mode, have a different
device number, in binary, to represent the hard disk from
other vendors such as Fujitsu which actually has somewhat
similar code in their driver.

This means we need to be somewhat cognizent of the vendor of
the BMC and possibly update the device mapping based upon that
vendor.

This may ultimately fix a number of IPMI related problems, because
there is a reliance upon the text output of ipmitool, which only
reads the bytes retured by the BMC, which may not be reality after
the next reset, espescialy if ipmitool doesn't know of the UEFI
operating difference.

NOTE: This had to be a direct cherry-pick from the original change
as the intermediate branch that we normally would have cherry-picked
from has had other changes made to it, which resulted in an unclean
backport, where as with the original change it was clean.

A bug has been introduced to the which package in CentOS Stream 8 which
causes it to fail when used with the following bash options:

set -u
set -o pipefail

Then, when running which we see the following output:

environment: line 1: _declare: unbound variable

As found by Pierre, this seems to be caused by the implementation of
which as a bash function which references an unbound variable
(_declare). It's tracked in Fedora by
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1944877#.

This change works around the issue by using the /usr/bin/which binary.

OS-Brick disconnect_volume code assumes that the use_multipath parameter
that is used to instantiate the connector has the same value than the
connector that was used on the original connect_volume call.

Unfortunately this is not necessarily true, because Nova can attach a
volume, then its multipath configuration can be enabled or disabled, and
then a detach can be issued.

This leads to a series of serious issues such as:

- Not flushing the single path on disconnect_volume (possible data loss)
  and leaving it as a leftover device on the host when Nova calls
  terminate-connection on Cinder.

- Not flushing the multipath device (possible data loss) and leaving it
  as a leftover device similarly to the other case.

This patch changes how we do disconnects, now we assume we are always
disconnecting multipaths, and fallback to doing the single path
disconnect we used to do if we can't go that route.

The case when we cannot do a multipathed detach is mostly when we did
the connect as a single path and the Cinder driver doesn't provide
portal_targets and portal_iqns in the connection info for non
multipathed initialize-connection calls.

This changes introduces an additional call when working with single
paths (checking the discoverydb), but it should be an acceptable
trade-off to not lose data.

Also includes squash to add release note from:

Partition images can sometimes contain a /boot folder structure
event he assets for EFI booting on that filesystem. Which is a
good thing. The conundrum is that Ironic does not handle this
properly and potentially replaces the bootloader in this sequence
such that grub2-install is used instead of signed bootloader assets.

As such, we should be preserving the assets and using them from
a partition image much like we do when we have a wholedisk
image and can identify the assets.

Now we will preserve the EFI boot assets, copy them to the new EFI
boot partition, and call the EFI setup methods to manage the EFI
nvram.

Note, this change also splits the logic path out that performs the
end call of the EFI boot manager into a reusable method but does
not retool all of the testing as it is intertwined in the
install_grub2 testing.

Also adds some additional debug logging, as much of the bootloader
installation code has multiple fallback/cleanup points which makes
it difficult to debug from logs.

Some hardware is very well intentioned. However this intention
can result in the UEFI NVRAM table being full which prevents us
from adding new records to the table. We can't be sure what to
delete, so in this case some operators just need the ability to
tell ironic ""it is okay if this fails, it will still work.""

The added ``ignore_bootloader_failure`` option adds
this capability which can be set per-node either in the agent
configuation via the ramdisk image, or in the pxe_append_params
configuration parameter for the node itself with a
``ipa-ignore-bootloader-failure`` option in order to prevent
the failure from being raised.

Until now, we only relied on the "":z"" flag in order to set container
volumes label to container_file_t.
While it works fine, it has multiple issues:
- if an operator runs a restorecon, it might break the container service
- if an SELinux related package is updated, it might reset the label,
  and break the container service
- it requires a container stop&start to reset the label to the expected
  value
- in case of deep tree or huge amount of file, relabelling takes time

This change ensures the system sets the expected context on the specific
locations, instead of following the content of selinux-policy-targeted
rulesets.

It has an equivalent for some locations in tripleo-ansible repository:
https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tripleo-ansible/+/782393

Note about swift locations:
Since openstack-selinux already sets fcontext rules for, at least, once
swift location, we can't override it here. The following
openstack-selinux patch is being pushed in order to work around this
specific case:

There's a TODO in the code to centralize foreign key constraint
enforcement for sqlite for unit and functional tests and we're missing
enforcement of FK constraints in a couple of test classes that should
have it.

This resolves the TODO and turns on FK constraint enforcement where it
is missing. Do this to enhance testing in preparation for a proposed
change to the database archiving logic later in this patch series.

This patch[1] remove the 'device_profile' key in the get device profile
api, which affects the stable/* branch's CI job such as [2], and the
'device_profile' can not be removed from the response. In the future,
we can use add a microversion to support removing it, that can be
unified with other APIs like devices and arqs.

Sometimes we get an unexpected failure on the lvs command where it exits
with code 139, which is not one of the 5 predefined ones in the code
ECMD_PROCESSED, ENO_SUCH_CMD, EINVALID_CMD_LINE, EINIT_FAILED, or
ECMD_FAILED.

We've seen this happen mostly on CI jobs when deleting a volume, on the
check to see if the volume is present (``_volume_not_present``) and
makes the whole operation unexpectedly fail.

When looking at the logs we can find other instances of this same exit
code happening in other calls, but those are fortunately to be covered
by retries for other unexpected errors such as bug #1335905 that seem to
make the call eventually succeed.

The stderr of the failure is polluted with debug and warning messages
such as:

  [1] /dev/sda1: stat failed: No such file or directory

      This has been removed [2] from the LVM code indicating it's
      somewhat troublesome, but doesn't explain how.

  [3] Path /dev/sda1 no longer valid for device(8,1)

  [4] WARNING: Scan ignoring device 8:0 with no paths.

But the real error is most likely:

  [5]: Device open /dev/sda 8:0 failed errno 2

On failure we see that error twice, because the code retries it in LVM
trying to workaround some kind of unknown udev race [6].

Since the LVM code indicates that a retry can help, we'll retry on error
139 when calling ``get_lv_info``.

To narrow down the retry we'll only do it on error 139, so we modify the
existing ``retry`` decorator to accept the ``retry`` parameter (same as
the tenacity library) and create our own retry if the
ProcessExecutionError fails with a specific error.

This pattern seems better than blindly retrying all
ProcessExecutionError cases.

Our recent Gerrit upgrade has made the emails method of the REST API
require essentially administrator permissions, making it no longer
feasible to find secondary addresses for change owners. Secondary
addresses really only served minor uses in this library anyway,
helping identify redundant accounts (which new Gerrit is forcing us
to clean up) and allowing slightly looser association to foundation
profiles.

Drop our use of the emails method, relying instead on the preferred
address provided with the owner record. In rare cases where an
account lacks a preferred address, substitute the committer address
from the first revision of the change where we initially encounter
that user.

from the full list of projects included in an election which, in a

TC. Rather than heavily refactor the utility function where that

In case it is a provider network and the port is a gateway port,
send_periodic should be set to False to avoid leaking the RAs generated

I94aa7a9824e44f9585ffb45e5e7637b9588539b4, which removed some deprecated
commands like 'openstack snapshot *' in favour of 'openstack volume

and were relying on tests for the former to validate behavior. Re-add
the tests removed back then.

The 1.6.3 [1] release has dropped support for py2 [2] but the release
is faulty and pip still picks it up for py2 [3][4], so cap to 1.6.2
when using py2.

With the introduction of the new dependency resolver in 20.3 pip the
lower-constraints job starts to fail as now the constraints are working
as they should. Multiple fixes needed:
* lower-constraints job uses the [testenv]install_command, so it gives
  both the upper-constraints and lower-constraints, which causes the
  job to fail. As an easy fix install_command is added to this target
  without the upper constraints.
* duplicate stestr constraint removed
* cryptography lower constraint is bumped as with version 2.1 the
  new resolver of pip takes hours to install the packages
* contradicting hacking version replaced (in lower-constraints.txt to
  match with test-requirements.txt), which pulls in newer flake8, too
* lower-constraints test job failed with error message:
  ""[..] unexpected keyword argument 'barbican_endpoint_type'""
  which is due to old version of castellan.

The local certmonger cert will renew after half its lifetime, which will
be after 6 months by default.  The current code would extract the CA cert
to a PEM file (and trust it), only if the cert in the existing PEM file
was expired.

But this means that the certmonger local cert could be renewed after six
months and not be replaced in the PEM file until the existing cert
expired at the end of the year.  If certs are issued in this time, they
will not be trusted and the update will fail.

This patch removes this condition, so that the extracted and trusted cert
always matches what is in the PEM file, and what is trusted.

Note, this only place this occurs is on the undercloud - because this is
where we could use the certmonger local cert.  We assume that the haproxy
cert will be re-issued in an update.

The octavia_ssh_enabled OSA variable is instead used to either write the

Currently this code assumes that there are facts available for all
network interfaces on the host. This may be hundreds of interfaces
for compute or network nodes.

If the OSA fact gathering is switched to be minimal to increase
deployment performance then is is necessary to gather information
about the interface to take the dynamiclly selected IP address from.

This patch adds a network facts gathering task which is filtered to
return only facts about the network interfaces specified in
container_networks, or in a new override dynamic_address_gather_filter.

The network facts are also now accessed via ansible_facts[] instead
of the hostvar ansible_<interface>.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect

will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/wallaby branch, tests will
continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

OpenstackAnsible is a trailing project so we think that these roles
should be aligned with the parent project of OSA team.

During previous series these roles and the parent project have
been branched more or less at the same time [1][2].

These changes propose to embrace the trailing nature of these
roles to avoid confusing at the end of each series.

If a previous partition power increase failed to cleanup all files in
their old partition locations, then during the next partition power
increase the relinker may find the same file to relink in more than
one source partition. This currently leads to an error log due to the
second relink attempt getting an EEXIST error.

This patch makes the relinker more tolerant of EEXIST errors by
checking if the existing file is a valid diskfile that is at least as
new as the file being linked, and not logging an error if that is the
case.

This relaxed error logging is only applied to tombstone files.

If a previous partition power increase failed to cleanup all files in
their old partition locations, then during the next partition power
increase the relinker may find the same file to relink in more than
one source partition. This currently leads to an error log due to the
second relink attempt getting an EEXIST error.

With this patch, when an EEXIST is raised, the relinker will attempt
to create/verify a link from older partition power locations to the
next part power location, and if such a link is found then suppress
the error log.

During the relink step, if an alternative link is verified and if a
file is found that is neither linked to the next partition power
location nor in the current part power location, then the file is
removed during the relink step. That prevents the same EEXIST occuring
again during the cleanup step when it may no longer be possible to
verify that an alternative link exists.

For example, consider identical filenames in the N+1th, Nth and N-1th
partition power locations, with the N+1th being linked to the Nth:

  - During relink, the Nth location is visited and its link is
    verified. Then the N-1th location is visited and an EEXIST error
    is encountered, but the new check verifies that a link exists to
    the Nth location, which is OK.

  - During cleanup the locations are visited in the same order, but
    files are removed so that the Nth location file no longer exists
    when the N-1th location is visited. If the N-1th location still
    has a conflicting file then existence of an alternative link to
    the Nth location can no longer be verified, so an error would be
    raised. Therefore, the N-1th location file must be removed during
    relink.

The error is only suppressed for tombstones. The number of partition
power location that the relinker will look back over may be configured
using the link_check_limit option in a conf file or --link-check-limit
on the command line, and defaults to 2.

It seems the current latest version of neutron-tempest-plugin available
in pip is not compatible with the latest tempest. Let's install it
from source so that we can always install the version compatible with
tempest.

Note:
Added version pin for stable backports.

Prior to this patch the IGMP configuration for ML2/OVN was inconsistent
with the configuration option description and also the ML2/OVS driver
because it was flooding traffic to unregistered VMs [0].

The ""igmp_snooping_enable"" configuration option says:

""Setting this option to True will also enable Open vSwitch
mcast-snooping-disable-flood-unregistered flag. This option will disable
flooding of unregistered multicast packets to all ports.""

But, in ML2/OVN that behavior was inconsistent prior to this patch
because it allowed traffic to flood to unregistered VMs. This patch
fixes it.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect
rule on releases.openstack.org so that anyone working on this branch
will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/wallaby branch, tests will
continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

If using separate branches for each environment, it can be useful to
read the environment name from a file committed to each branch. Or, if
sharing the same branch for all environments, it can be useful to set
the default environment to one with lower impact, e.g. dev or staging.

If no --environment option is specified and a .environment file exists
at the root of the directory, use its content as KAYOBE_ENVIRONMENT.

The kayobe-env script would try accessing $1 which is an unbound
variable if no argument is passed. This fails when `set -u` is set.

Also refactor usage output into a function. As a side effect, a missing
argument to --environment now causes the script to properly exit with an
error.
