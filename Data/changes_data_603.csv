In order to properly achieve rolling upgrades
in situations where the container configuration
may change, the container creation or config
change needs to be done in a serialised fashion.

If simultaneously replacing containers (which
is especially good for major upgrades), the
container replacement must be done in serial
followed by the service setup.

Also, currently the playbooks are duplicating
much of the work being done in the container
create role so it would be ideal to reduce that
duplication.

This patch moves the container creation process
which was executed in a single playbook to the
service plays so that each service playbook
creates its own containers and so that each
container group can be serialised as required.

TODO:
- Complete the Infrastructure playbooks.
- Complete the OpenStack playbooks.
- Clean up references to run-playbooks.sh
  and replace them with running the
  setup-everything.yml meta playbook.
- Add a release note.

Due to the debug message plugin the handler restart
messages show at the end of the playbook execution

requires setting changed_when to true which is a
little extra bit of code which we do not have to
carry.

Instead we use the command module which is simple,
works and less wordy.

We cannot use the --selinux-enabled docker daemon option on CentOS/RHEL 7.3.
It will fail if security_inode_copy_up is not found in the kernel symbols:
https://github.com/projectatomic/docker/blob/docker-1.12.6/daemon/daemon_unix.go#L661
NB this has been reduced to a warning upstream:
https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/885b29df096db1d6746ece4b3a298a1ffe85716d

Instead this just bind mounts /sys/fs/selinux in containers-common.yaml.

Everything appears to work at initial glance. Pingtest succeeds, and
live-migration between baremetal and containerized computes works.

In Ocata all live-migration over ssh is performed on the default ssh port (22).
In Pike the containerized live-migration over ssh is on port 2022 as the

To allow live migration during upgrade we need to temporarily pin the Pike
computes to port 22 and in the final converge we can switch over to port 2022.

This patch make the necessary puppet-tripleo change to allow this:
 - Adds support in sshd profile for listening on multiple ports.
 - Adds a profile to allow proxying to the containerized sshd from the
   baremetal sshd

The ceph-osd package is only required on nodes hosting the CephOSD
service, but the package's presence on other nodes may interfere with
software updates. That's because some distros distribute Ceph software
in different channels, and not all nodes have access to the ceph-osd
channel.

There are two parts to the fix, and the first is an enhancement to the
yum update process. The process detects when the ceph-osd package is not
required, and removes the package from the node.

The second part takes ceph-osd out of the default list of packages
needed by puppet-ceph. The ceph-osd package is listed only on the nodes
hosting the CephOSD service.

I don't particularly care about this use case (although the localfs
code should perhaps go away), but it was a nice contained example
of a privsep user which wasn't just calling a command line.

This patch also starts to layout what an API to the privsep'd code
might look like. For now its modelled on python's os module, because
that's where all the operations we perform are coming from.

The rootwrap configuration is cleaned up as we remove users.

There are use cases where an user wants to not have backend packages
automatically installed. One use case would be the user having an alternative
set of packages already providing backend packages as built-in dependencies.
Installing system packages is redundant, useless and causing confusion.

This change adds the ability to disable backend packages management
while preserving previous behavior which consists of installing them
automatically.

This lays the groundwork for ConductorTaskTestCase to run
with two cells which is needed for an upcoming fix.

As a result, some mocks needed to be removed for targeting
a cell context, but we still assert a targeted context is
used where necessary, just in a different way. Some other
DB-hitting operations needed to be mocked out in the unshelve
tests since the instance being worked on isn't actually in
a database, and these should have probably been mocked out
anyway.

It is revision #2 of c517b0011857_fill_missed_workload_info migration.

* The original migration had a critical issue:
 - it processed duration stats to row rendered format(like html reports
   expects) instead of saving it like db api did. It lead to broken
   `rally task detailed` for migrated data

* There were a lot of charts and tables which required merged atomic
  actions and some stats. Such info we had in the database.  After some
  refactoring MainStatsTable provides all required information and we
  can store in the database less data.

* For some reasons, we forget to include idle_duration into stats of
  workload. It should be fixed.

The total duration of an iteration consists of two components:

 * `duration` - time in seconds if doing something
 * `idle_duration` - time is seconds of sleeping (waiting for something)

In html report (main table) and in duration stats, `duration` was used
as total duration, which lead to strange data in some cases.
This patch fixed the values of total row and adds sub-atomics with
duration and idle_duration (we finally can do it with nested atomics).

Also, since total row is not the last in the table any more, this patch
adds an ability to setup css class name of the rows for html. `total`
row should be bold in any case and all nested atomic actions are italic
now.

If using rabbitmq as rpc backend, oslo.messaging generates large amount
of redundant timeout debug logs (several logs per second on multiple
openstack services, such as nova, heat, cinder), in format of 'Timed out
waiting for RPC response: Timeout while waiting on RPC response - topic:
""<unknown>"", RPC method: ""<unknown>"" info: ""<unknown>'. It's because
each socket timeout exception is raised to multiple levels of error
recovery callback functions then logged repeatedly.

However, the accompanying value of socket.timeout exception is currently
always “timed out”. Besides, oslo.messaging has implemented retry
mechanism to recover socket timeout failure. Therefore, IMO those logs
should be suppressed, even if at debug level, to save disk space and
make debugging more convenient.

The recent format of atomic actions solved several serios issues which
had been found in the old format:

* ordered dict is not something obvious for the end users, so the
  processing of task results was the pain for new customers (the order
  of atomic actions was lost);

* dict doesn't allow to store several atomics with equal names (the case
  when you need to create several entities of one resource). It lead to
  providing 2 workarounds: auto changing atomic names (in case if the
  name is used, `(i)` suffix had been added to the name); wrapping
  several actions by one parent atomic action like `create_10_resources`
  (which lead to losing timings of the separate actions).

Using list fixes all these issues. Despite the fact that list is quite
good data type which can garantee the similar processing the results in
different languages and tools, not all the places required the extended
information about atomic actions. In combination with inability to port
all places in code to the new atomic action format(it is impossible to
do it at once), it leads to creating temporary dict for charts of HTML
reports. Since this temporaty dict was helpful in a bunch of places, to
reduce creation time of it, we kept it in the database.

After some time this temporary dict become quite similar to the atomic
duration stats which are produced by MainStatsTable. Even more, after
porting MainStatsTable to support nested atomic actions, temporary dict
became a limited version duration stats results which we keep in the
database too.

There is no reason to store temporary dict in the database any more,
since it looks like duplication of duration stats but in the different
formats. To reduce the redundant data and leave only one source of truth
for atomic duration stats, this patch removes usage of temporary dict.

Note: despite the fact that we stopped saving this temporary dict in
      the database for new workloads, there is no database migration in
      current patch. It is done in the separate patch which merges all
      the fixes of workload duration in the one database migration.

Recent refactoring of atomic actions allowed to store nested atomic
actions in the database. There is only one way to see them (using JSON
exporter which is not merged at the time this commit message is
written). It would be nice to not ignore them and expose to users as
much as possible useful information.
This patch adds support of nested atomic actions to the main table of
HTML reports. Since the implementation of it (class MainStatsTable) is
used in several places, this patch makes a bit more useful things:

* The format of storing duration stats in the database.
  Note: the proper database migration is done in the separate patch
        (the last patch in the chain), since the format proposed in this
        patch is not final and it will be changed in the following
        patches. In other words there is no reason to propose the similar
        migrations which will iterate throw all workloads and provide
        temporary result

* Fix the processing of failed iterations. If the iteration has several
  atomic action and one of it fails (not the first one), all the
  previous atomic actions are marked as failed too (but they succeded
  since otherwice all the following actions would not be executed) with
  increasing counters of execution numbers(which is ok), but without
  taking into accaunt the durations (which lead to wrong data of min,
  max,  avg, median, 90%ile, 95%ile stats).

Ironic has been seeing [0] sporatic timeout failures where jobs
are timing out due to slow nodes where devstack is occassionally
taking upwards of 45 minutes to complete installation.

As such, we are extending the timeouts for our CI jobs in
order to reduce the number of timeouts and wasted resources
due to rechecks.

whereto is developed on OpenStack infrastructure. I am in the process
of having the docs team adopt it for maintenance.

Is the library actively maintained? - Yes. This is an OpenStack
community product.

Is the library good code? - Only the best.

Is the library python 3 compatible? - Yes. It has the standard python
3 unit test jobs in its gate.

Is the library license compatible? - Yes, Apache 2.

Is the library already packaged in the distros? - No, but it's a doc
build tool so it may not need to be.

Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries? -
I was unable to find any similar tool that could be downloaded and run
in CI anywhere at all, so no.

Is the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or
infrastructure setup? - It is a tool for testing redirect rules and
will be an optional component in doc CI jobs. The documentation team
is already using it (the openstack-manuals repo does not follow the
global requirements process).

If the library release is managed by the Openstack release process
does it use the cycle-with-intermediary release type? - It will likely
continue to use the independent release model after being formally
adopted, but that is not decided.

If system time is adjusted first forward and then backward while a
nova service is running (e.g. nova-compute), then there is a high
probability, that periodic tasks will stop for the duration of time
the system clock was adjusted backward.

This was supposed to be fixed by the following patch to oslo.service
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/286838/ , but the order of imports
in unit tests and production code is different, so nova services
end up starting with the default eventlet hub, that does not use a
monotonic clock and, thus, is affected by changes of system time.

Testing this is problematic, as it's a subject of imports order and
is not reproduced in functional or unit tests (oslo_service is always
imported earlier than eventlet hub is initialized, so it just does
""the right thing""). The alternative is to make an assertion when
services start.

The test case requires access to devices created by DHCP agent. When the
agent is deployed with linuxbridge agent, we start it in a host-
namespace, and then it creates its own qdhcp- namespaces for dhcp ports
inside the host- namespace.

This could be solved by calling:
ip netns exec host-* ip netns exec qdhcp-* ip link show ...
but ip_lib doesn't support constructing such commands.

Of course, we could extend ip_lib to support this use case, but
currently we have larger dragons to fight. We will revisit the skip once
all agents are moved to namespaces as planned by jlibosva@.

This patch merely disables the test case if DHCP agent is running in a
namespace. We may revisit it when and if we feel comfortable making
significant changes to ip_lib.

The new attachment_update method in Cinder's API creates an attachment
object and populates it with the provided connector info. In addition,
we set the volumes status to in-use and update the attachment object
status to ""attached"".

This isn't really accurate though, because we don't know if the volume
is actually attached (connected) by the consumer or not.  Also a big
side effect here is that currently all of our tests and automation
use volume-status to determine if a volume is fully connected/ready
for use and that everything went well.  It's used as an ack in most
cases.

This change goes back to using multiple states to signify where a
an attachment is in it's life-cycle:
1. attachment_create
    We've created an empty attachment record but haven't done anything
    with it yet.
2. attachment_update
    We provided a connector and set up the TGT so that everything is
    ready for a consumer to connect/use it.
3. attachment_complete
    An ACK back from the consumer letting us know that they connected
    it successfully and are doing their thing.

It would be cool to just key all these checks of the attachment object itself,
and just use attachment_update to do so, maybe in the future?

Python allows multiple inheritance, which we use in order to mix and
match test scenarios and actions.

Python performs method resolution as follows:
- checks if the method is defined in the current class.
- if not, check parents, left to right.

Since all tests have test_base as its left-most parent, all methods
are resolved in test_base, which is not the desired behaviour. This
affects optional_feature mixin in particular.

This commit releases os-testr 1.0.0, this is a major version bump
because it changes the testr runner used internally from testr to
stestr. This cleans up the code significantly and also means we stop
calling python via subprocess. However because stestr and testr aren't
100% compatible this has the potential to not be backwards compatible.
Since we're quite early in the queens cycle this is the best time to
make a release like this.

Upstream iptables added support for -w ('wait') argument to
iptables-restore. It makes the command grab a 'xlock' that guarantees
that no two iptables calls will mess a table if called in parallel.
[This somewhat resembles what we try to achieve with a file lock we
grab in iptables manager's _apply_synchronized.]

If two processes call to iptables-restore or iptables in parallel, the
second call risks failing, returning error code = 4, and also printing
the following error:

    Another app is currently holding the xtables lock. Perhaps you want
    to use the -w option?

If we call to iptables / iptables-restore with -w though, it will wait
for the xlock release before proceeding, and won't fail.

Though the feature was added in iptables/master only and is not part of
an official iptables release, it was already backported to RHEL 7.x
iptables package, and so we need to adopt to it. At the same time, we
can't expect any underlying platform to support the argument.

A solution here is to call iptables-restore with -w when a regular call
failed. Also, the patch adds -w to all iptables calls, in the iptables
manager as well as in ipset-cleanup.

Since we don't want to lock agent in case current xlock owner doesn't
release it in reasonable time, we limit the time we wait to ~1/3 of
report_interval, to give the agent some time to recover without
triggering expensive fullsync.

In the future, we may be able to get rid of our custom synchronization
lock that we use in iptables manager. But this will require all
supported platforms to get the feature in and will take some time.

`resource_set_health_monitor` is a class method, so the `cls` param will
be a class object and not an instantiated object, whereas
`_create_health_monitor` is not a classmethod can thus be called only
when bound to an object.

This fix keeps the method as classmethod and
allows passing a `creater` which can be used as factory of `health
monitors`

The CentOS gate jobs have been plagued by intermittent network
connectivity issues, including failures downloading yum metadata
and failures resolving DNS records. This is happening because
dnsmasq is inaccessible and network paths are broken.

The lxc-net service is trampling on the ifup hooks that run
lxc-system-manage, which takes care of the routes, iptables rules,
and dnsmasq. This patch disables, stops, and masks the lxc-net
service on CentOS to match Ubuntu.

Upstream iptables added support for -w ('wait') argument to
iptables-restore. It makes the command grab a 'xlock' that guarantees
that no two iptables calls will mess a table if called in parallel.
[This somewhat resembles what we try to achieve with a file lock we
grab in iptables manager's _apply_synchronized.]

If two processes call to iptables-restore or iptables in parallel, the
second call risks failing, returning error code = 4, and also printing
the following error:

    Another app is currently holding the xtables lock. Perhaps you want
    to use the -w option?

If we call to iptables / iptables-restore with -w though, it will wait
for the xlock release before proceeding, and won't fail.

Though the feature was added in iptables/master only and is not part of
an official iptables release, it was already backported to RHEL 7.x
iptables package, and so we need to adopt to it. At the same time, we
can't expect any underlying platform to support the argument.

A solution here is to call iptables-restore with -w when a regular call
failed. Also, the patch adds -w to all iptables calls, in the iptables
manager as well as in ipset-cleanup.

Since we don't want to lock agent in case current xlock owner doesn't
release it in reasonable time, we limit the time we wait to ~1/3 of
report_interval, to give the agent some time to recover without
triggering expensive fullsync.

In the future, we may be able to get rid of our custom synchronization
lock that we use in iptables manager. But this will require all
supported platforms to get the feature in and will take some time.

* Previously we thought that we can avoid locking task execution
  when we process completion of an individual action inside
  WithItemsTask. But that was wrong because even when we don't
  need to control ""concurrency"" property we still can get a
  situation when two different action completions will be
  processed via scheduler and both will see all actions in state
  SUCCESS (because scheduler handles it in a different later
  transaction) and hence both will complete the task and run
  tasks from ""on-xxx"" clauses. This patch makes WithItemsTask
  always use locking.
* Added db_utils.retry_on_deadlock for
  _scheduled_on_action_complete() method since it opens a new
  DB transaction and can potentially end up in a dead lock (due
  to MySQL nature)

Also update the clear method to call cache.delete on
all objects, thus marking them as stale.

Otherwise, object reuse in tests causes objects that
were deleted between tests to appear as if they are
still cached.

Guest VMs created for DPDK will have the vhost-user socket files
created by qemu and used by openvswitch. The uid of qemu in host
is 107 where as the uid set by kolla config is 42427. Because of
this mismatch, VM creation is failing because of permission.

Setting the same uid and gid for qemu user for building kolla
images to ensure that the files are created and used with same
permission. This patch adds a config file for TripleO to be
used for building kolla images, which will have the qemu
user id values override to match the host values.

As described in the bug report, DeployedSSLCertificatePath is used by
the TLS injection script (if you decide to use that).

There is an alternative, which is to use FreeIPA to provide the
certificate for public TLS (powered by certmonger); however, it doesn't
use the same path as what folks expected. This reuses the
DeployedSSLCertificatePath parameter and uses that as a path for the
resulting PEM file, so its easier to debug.

Some request details provided information about the other
JSON value while others didn't. To make things consistent
and to make sure API consumers understand how the requests
need to be structured, this adds missing instances. It also
reorders some parameter lists to be a little more logical,
so even though we can't show the nested nature of some of
these, it at least doesn't show inner values before outer
ones.

This also corrects many errors seen while going through
the API ref. This is by no means exhaustive, and is already
somewhat out of the scope for this patch, so it is expected
that there are some (many) cases that are not addressed by
this patch. Those will be fixed with ongoing effort in
future patches.

Ethernet trunks (network interfaces having a vlan tag) cannot be used
as a boot interface. This is a DHCP/PXE limitation. So instead the
interface without the vlan tag can be used. In neutron's nomenclature
they are the trunk parents. It is also an OpenStack limitation. Subports
should not be passed to 'openstack server create --nic ...'. But if you
do, there's no clear error message about it. Please see Armando's
analysis here why:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1636485/comments/9

The server part of this patch signals port kind (i.e. plain, trunkparent,
trunksubport) so the launch widget can easily filter out trunksubports,
what are not suitable for boot interface.

a Cinder volume is created and attached to the compute node as
a Linux device. The next step is to mount the Linux device to
a path in local file system so that Docker can bind mount it
to containers.

The utility module is basically a wrapper to execute a few
Linux commands to mount, unmount, and read mounts in local host.
The mounting device should be a block device backed by Cinder.
If the mounting device is unformatted (the Cinder volume is newly
created), the module will try to format the device. Otherwise,
the device won't be formatted.

Each call to output_show is taking around 15 seconds for me, which
causes the entire inventory process to take 90 seconds or more.
Loading the entire stack with outputs resolved only takes around
20 seconds and keeps the total runtime of the dynamic inventory
much shorter overall because it only has to be done once.

The stack is lazy loaded at the first call to __getitem__ because it
seems that Ansible instantiates multiple copies of the class but
never actually looks anything up in some of them, so if we load the
stack in the constructor we just waste time retrieving it

Each call to output_show is taking around 15 seconds for me, which
causes the entire inventory process to take 90 seconds or more.
Loading the entire stack with outputs resolved only takes around
20 seconds and keeps the total runtime of the dynamic inventory
much shorter overall because it only has to be done once.

The stack is lazy loaded at the first call to __getitem__ because it
seems that Ansible instantiates multiple copies of the class but
never actually looks anything up in some of them, so if we load the
stack in the constructor we just waste time retrieving it
unnecessarily.

This change has reduced the time it takes to run even simple ad-hoc
commands against a small 2 node inventory from 2.5-3 minutes to
45 seconds (which is still too long IMHO, but a step in the right
direction).

When creating a nested stack and pre-storing the raw template, we
previously used a try/finally block to ensure that if the stack creation
was never started (e.g. because the template failed validation at the other
end) that we would delete the raw template again rather than leave it lying
around in the DB. However, this catches too broad a range of exceptions. If
an exception such as GreenletExit occurs inside this block, then we will
attempt to delete the raw template, resulting in a DB IntegrityError either
here (because the template id is already referenced by a stack) or when
trying to store the stack (because the template is gone).

Resolve this by only doing the cleanup on HeatExceptions, which indicates
that the other engine has bailed out without storing the stack.

This change removes the entry to containerise docker by default
because it should now be disabled since the change
Id2e6550fb7c319fc52469644ea022cf35757e0ce.

Removing the entry means the default mapping to mongodb-disabled.yaml
takes effect.

This change also modifies the upgrade_tasks so that the mongod service
is only disabled when the service exists. There appears to be upgrade
scenarios which fail because mongodb was never installed in the first
place.

As described in the bug report, DeployedSSLCertificatePath is used by
the TLS injection script (if you decide to use that).

There is an alternative, which is to use FreeIPA to provide the
certificate for public TLS (powered by certmonger); however, it doesn't
use the same path as what folks expected. This reuses the
DeployedSSLCertificatePath parameter and uses that as a path for the
resulting PEM file, so its easier to debug.

The ceph-osd package is only required on nodes hosting the CephOSD
service, but the package's presence on other nodes may interfere with
software updates. That's because some distros distribute Ceph software
in different channels, and not all nodes have access to the ceph-osd
channel.

There are two parts to the fix, and the first is an enhancement to the
yum update process. The process detects when the ceph-osd package is not
required, and removes the package from the node.

The second part takes ceph-osd out of the default list of packages
needed by puppet-ceph. The ceph-osd package is listed only on the nodes
hosting the CephOSD service.

Adds the 'pseudo_vhost' option which when enabled will incorporate the
virtual host into the address semantics.  This creates a 'subnet' like
address space for each virtual host.  Use this when the messaging bus
does not provide virtual hosting support.  It is enabled by default as
to date none of the supported AMQP 1.0 message buses natively support
virtual hosting.

It also updates SSL support: SSL can either use the connection
hostname or the vhost name when validating a server's
certificate. This is controlled by the 'ssl_verify_vhost' option.
This option is disabled by default as it requires both vhost and SNI
support from the server.  By default SSL will use the DNS name from
the TransportURL.

With cell v2, on initial bring up, discover hosts can't run unless all
the compute nodes have checked in. The documentation says that you
should run ``nova service-list --binary nova-compute`` and see all
your hosts before running discover hosts. This isn't really viable in
a multinode devstack because of how things are brought up in parts.

We can however know that stack.sh will not complete before the compute
node is up by waiting for the compute node to check in before
completing. This happens quite late in the stack.sh run, so shouldn't
add any extra time in most runs.

Cells v1 and Xenserver don't use real hostnames in the service table
(they encode complex data that is hostname like to provide more
topology information than just hostnames). They are exempted from this
check.

stestr [1][2][3] is a fork of the testrepository project that
concentrates on being a dedicated parallel python test runner. It fixes
a bunch of bugs and adds a bunch of features on top of testrepository.
Moving forward several projects will be migrating to using it instead of
testr by itself. (long term I'd like to get everything over to use
stestr) The plan is to also switch os-testr under the covers
eventually. To support the migration in the future this commit makes
sure the post processing steps we do in run_tox.sh can handle runs from
stestr as well as testrepository. The basic flow is the same but the
command and repository paths are slightly different.

We have seen in Dragonflow tempest tests that docker bridges do not
always clean-up correctly, and this causes false-positive errors.

This change modifies the name of the bridge to be unique for each test.
This way, if a test fails to clean up, it will not affect the other
tests.

mnaio_host_distro_packages and adds a new task to build.sh to
install it before site.yml is kicked off.

NOTE: This commit also switches to installing netaddr via pip
      instead of system package since that does not require pre-loading
      vars files depending on OS, etc.

Deploying the multi-node-aio from master on a machine running Ubuntu
14.04 fails frequently as libvirt doesn't think it has the hvm
OS type.  I was able to manually run ""virsh capabilities"" shortly after
libvirt was installed and sure enough it didn't list any guest
capabilities.  Subsequent runs of ""virsh capabilities"" then returned
the <guest> XML element w/ <os_type>hvm</os_type> defined.

This commit simply adds a task that checks ""virsh capabilities"",
retrying up to 6 times if the <guest> element is not present.  From my
limit testing this seems sufficient to ensure that the domains are
defined and created successfully.

Lastly, we add a task to create /etc/libvirt/storage which is expected
to exist, but doesn't on a 14.04 deployment.

Plugins supporting the new extension are expected to signal support for

An advantage of consuming keystoneauth is that the application doesn't
need to know the details of the authentication sequence to use the
library. Currently in testing they are having to provide a specific auth
plugin and this means their tests execute this full auth sequence and
they have to mock that out.

Create a SimpleTestPlugin that has the standard values that an
application might be interested in. This can be used in testing instead
of a real plugin to remove any network interaction and simplify the
authentication component so applications can focus on their problems.

We then create 2 fixtures that will mock out functions to load the
SimpleTestPlugin instead of a real plugin in application code.

The SimpleLoaderFixture will mock out all calls to keystoneauth plugin
loading and return the basic plugin, which is going to be sufficient for
testing for most applications.

The SimplePluginFixutre will mock out a specific function and return a
SimpleTestPlugin so that applications can mock out just a specific
section of loading code.

When manila is deployed with self-signed SSL certificates, its tempest
tests fail with a certificate verification error. In this deployment
scenario, manila can not be tempest tested.

This patch uses the value of the generic option
`identity.disable_ssl_certificate_validation` from `tempest.conf` to
optionally disable certificate verification in manila tests, allowing
operators to test a manila deployment with self-signed SSL certificates.

To enable, the following has to be set in `tempest.conf`:

Two files are removed.

'ebtables.workaround' was required for libvirt < 1.2.11 for the reasons
described in the file itself. We no longer support this version of
libvirt, thus, the workaround can be removed.

'regression_tester' is a tool for running tests in a patch against old
code, to ensure the tests validate what the patch is supposed to be
fixing. This is unmaintained and is not referenced anywhere, and should
therefore be removed as it's likely bitrotted (or will do so).

With cell v2, on initial bring up, discover hosts can't run unless all
the compute nodes have checked in. The documentation says that you
should run ``nova service-list --binary nova-compute`` and see all
your hosts before running discover hosts. This isn't really viable in
a multinode devstack because of how things are brought up in parts.

We can however know that stack.sh will not complete before the compute
node is up by waiting for the compute node to check in before
completing. This happens quite late in the stack.sh run, so shouldn't
add any extra time in most runs.

Cells v1 and Xenserver don't use real hostnames in the service table
(they encode complex data that is hostname like to provide more
topology information than just hostnames). They are exempted from this
check.

Deleting snapshot may take time. The current volume API does not allow
to delete volumes with snapshots, so if deleting snapshot may take time,
a delete request for a parent volume will fail.
This sometimes causes functional test failures in slow environments.

wait_for_status() checks whether volume status is in error statuses
but previously the expected error status was wrong. Cinder API uses
lower case as volume status, so it did not work expectedly.

This makes sure that the openstack client placement plugin gets
installed when either LIBS_FROM_GIT includes osc-placement or
placement is used, which is always now if you've enabled nova,
which is enabled by default.
