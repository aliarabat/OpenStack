With the current Agent Management and Scheduler extensions we are not able to
effectively distribute the DHCP namespace services when there are multiple
Network Nodes available. Existing scheduler(Chance Scheduler) does not
load balance the DHCP namespace properly across multiple Network Nodes based
on the network load of DHCP agents.
Chance scheduler schedules DHCP namespaces unevenly, which is not suitable
when large number of namespaces are created.
In our deployment we observed that Chance scheduler schedules around 90% of
DHCP namespaces on a single Network Node and remaining 10% of namespaces are
distributed across remaining Network Nodes.

This blueprint attempts to address this issue by proposing a new DHCP agent
scheduler which will equally distribute the DHCP namespaces across multiple
Network Nodes based on network load of DHCP agents.

Today there is no functionality to validate the project that
is consumed by Nova.  One reason for the lack of such
functionality is performance, where validating to external
services can cause poor performance.  However, such functionality
is needed in cases where the user passes in the project ID or
name (e.g. quota management), so that the correct quota is set.
Such functionality is also needed where the user wants to grant a
project access to a flavor.

This blueprint proposes a way to validate a specified project
with Keystone.  This blueprint is only intented for cases
where the API calls are done on a very infrequent basis.  More
specifically, it is only meant to be used for validating
project ID in quota management (i.e. quota-defaults, quota-show,
quota-update) and in flavor management (i.e. flavor-access-add,
flavor-access-list).  A separate blueprint is required for any
functionality that is outside of quota and flavor management.

we are switching stable branch maintenance to project-specific teams

Some Oslo libraries follow a ""compatible"" release cycle and therefore
use stable branches -- the proposed change is to create a unique
oslo-stable-maint team to review such changes. Oslo libraries which
follow a free release cycle (taskflow, oslosphinx, pbr...) do not use
stable branches and therefore do not need their ACLs changed.

The oslo-stable-maint team should be owned by stable-maint-core which
will vet the addition of members to make sure they are aware of the

This change is to support updating the v2 and v3 /servers and
/servers/detail APIs to support multiple sort keys and sort directions
(using the 'sort_key' and 'sort_dir' parameters); these parameters can
be specified multiple times to create a list of sort keys and
directions.

Contains the changes that will be used by the REST API layer:
* Compute API updates on the get_all function to support sort keys
  and directions
* InstanceList updates on the get_by_filters function. The new
  'sort_keys' and 'sort_dirs' kwargs are added but the existing
  'sort_key' and 'sort_dir' kwargs must remain for backward
  compatibility.
* DB API has a new 'instance_get_all_by_filters_sort' function that
  supports multiple keys/directions. The existing
  'instance_get_all_by_filters' remains for backward compatibility
  and calls the new sort function with the single sort values
  wrapped in a list.

Note that the defaulting of the sort keys and directions is done in
the dependent patch set in the new 'process_sort_params' function
(invoked in db.sqlalchemy.api); by default, the sort keys are
'created_at' and 'id' in the 'desc' direction.

The REST API changes that consume these updated will be pushed in
another change set.

In order to test the rollback feature we used to inject raising error
code in one of our upgraders in-place:

    self.fuel_web.modify_python_file(self.env.get_admin_remote(),
                                    ""61i \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ raise errors.""

                                    'openstack.py')

It's a bad design decision which leads to time-to-time falls in tests due
to changes in the upgrader's code. So the commit is going to solve this
issue by providing a special upgrader which will always fail.

Usage example:

    $ UPGRADERS=""host-system docker openstack raise-error"" ./upgrade.sh

Recently, we added new job ""gate-rally-dsvm-verify"" for Rally[1].
This job implied functional testing integration Rally with Tempest[2].

This patch adds tests/ci/rally-verify.sh script, which is used by new job.

rally-verify.sh does:
- tempest installation
- run ""rally verify start"" twice and print results
- compare results of two verifications
- list verifications
- generate html page based on results

To implement gate-rally-dsvm-verify some changes were requered to
existing Rally code:
- Added ability for rally/ui/utils.py to accept arguments to render html-pages
- Fixed logging debug-messages in tempest verifier
- Fixed check ""is debug mode turned on or not""(also, added hacking rule for it)

TODO for future patches:
- add launch of rally task for Tempest
- add launch of random test set
- add check for successful tests

We need to ensure that every single subcommand of “rally task”,
“rally deployment” etc. (for example, “rally task start”, “rally

parameters usage (e.g. the “--deployment” parameter in “rally task

If neutron sends a single event to nova and the server_uuid isn't found
in nova. The python-novaclient will raise a 404 error. This patch ensures
we explicitly catch that exception and use LOG.warning instead of LOG.exception
as this is not an error and can happen when deleting an instance if neutron
detects that the port_status goes down before the port is deleted because
nova first unplugs the vif and then deletes it from neutron.

New policy code requires that CONF is already initialized when policy
checks are invoked. It means that no Neutron context objects should be
created before BaseTestCase.setUp() is called that will set
configuration, among other things.

Ideally, we would just make sure that all test cases invoke
super().setUp() as the very first line of any subclass setUp() methods.
But since some of test cases require prior setup (like mocking extension
manager) before proceeding to base class, we end up with magically
shuffling context instantiations to occur below super() calls.

Deletion sessions were in 'deploying' state instead of 'deleting'.
Because of this such sessions could not be found by RPC result
processing code and remained in 'deploying' status causing UI
to display progress bar forever

Also there were 2 duplicate SessionStates enums in the code
and the second copy was outdated and didn't contained DELETING
status as well as other new session statuses. Because buggy code
was using that outdated enum it was necessary to merge both enums
into single declaration

Instead of having code that is some what like the notifier
code we already have, but is duplicated and is slightly different
in the task class just move the code that was in the task class (and
doing similar actions) to instead now use a notifier that is directly
contained in the task base class for internal task triggering of
internal task events.

Breaking change: alters the capabilities of the task to process
notifications itself, most actions now must go through the task
notifier property and instead use that (update_progress still exists
as a common utility method, since it's likely the most common type
of notification that will be used).

Removes the following methods from task base class (as they are
no longer needed with a notifier attribute):

- trigger (replaced with notifier.notify)
- autobind (removed, not replaced, can be created by the user
            of taskflow in a simple manner, without requiring
            functionality in taskflow)
- bind (replaced with notifier.register)
- unbind (replaced with notifier.unregister)
- listeners_iter (replaced with notifier.listeners_iter)

Due to this change we can now also correctly proxy back events from
remote tasks to the engine for correct proxying back to the original
task.

According to the HTTP spec, a HEAD request should return the same
status and headers as the GET request (including content-type and
content-length). The HEAD request simply strips out the body and
returns no body. Any case where HEAD routing returned a different
status code than GET, now returns the same status and headers.

Any case where HEAD was supported where GET was not supported now
supports both GET and HEAD.

The wsgi.render_response code now handles HEAD appropriately and
will maintain headers while enforcing no body data is returned.

The bulk of this change is to support the same behavior between
deploying Keystone under eventlet and under HTTPD + mod_wsgi. In
the case of deploying under HTTPD + mod_wsgi, there are cases
where mod_wsgi will turn a HEAD request into a GET request to
ensure that the proper response is rendered. With these changes
all HEAD responses will respond in the same manner under either
eventlet or mod_wsgi.

Since radvd 2.0, the daemon does not use daemon_fork() function from
libdaemon, but instead calls Linux daemon() function directly. It also
passes (1, 1) arguments when logging method (-m) is either stderr (the
default) or stderr_syslog. The second argument's value = 1 means that
stderr is not closed and left there for (some) log messages.

For neutron, it means that corresponding execute() call that spawns
radvd and expects the invoked process to close stderr does not ever get
completed. The current thread that spawned radvd is locked waiting for
radvd to exit, which does not ever occur unless the process crashes or
receives a signal.

Since L3 agent gives exclusive access to updates queue for each router
to one of processing threads only, it means that the thread that got to
serve a radvd-powered subnet will not proceed and not update any new
ports or other changes to the router anymore.

Passing -m syslog makes radvd 2.0+ close stderr and return to execute()
caller, proceeding with router update processing. The same arguments
should work for old (pre 2.0) versions of radvd too, so passing them
unconditionally.

We could instead use -m logfile and pass appropriate -l <logfile>
argument to radvd to make it log to a log file located in router's
namespace storage path. Though that would be not in line with what
dnsmasq processes currently do for dhcp agent, where we log all messages
to syslog, so sticking to syslog for radvd for consistency.

Summary:
  Adds an optimistic locking strategy for the Big Switch
  server manager so multiple Neutron servers wanting to
  communicate with the backend do not receive the consistency
  hash for use simultaneously.

  The bsn-rest-call semaphore is removed because serialization
  is now provided by the new locking scheme.

  A new DB engine is added because the consistency hashes
  need a life-cycle with rollbacks and other DB operations
  than cannot impact or be impacted by database operations
  happening on the regular Neutron objects.

  Unit tests are included for each of the new branches
  introduced.

Problem Statement:
  Requests to the Big Switch controllers must contain the
  consistency hash value received from the previous update.
  Otherwise, an inconsistency error will be triggered which
  will force a synchronization. Essentially, a new backend
  call must be prevented from reading from the consistency
  hash table in the DB until the previous call has updated
  the table with the hash from the server response.

  This can be addressed by a semaphore around the rest_call
  function for the single server use case and by a table lock
  on the consistency table for multiple Neutron servers.
  However, both solutions are inadequate because a single
  Neutron server does not scale and a table lock is not
  supported by common SQL HA deployments (e.g. Galera).

  This issue was previously addressed by deploying servers
  in an active-standby configuration. However, that only
  prevented the problem for HTTP API calls. All Neutron
  servers would respond to RPC messages, some of which would
  result in a port update and possible backend call which
  would trigger a conflict if it happened at the same time
  as a backend call from another server. These unnecessary
  syncs are unsustainable as the topology increases beyond
  ~3k VMs.

  Any solution needs to be back-portable to Icehouse so new
  database tables, new requirements, etc. are all out of the
  question.

Solution:
  This patch stores the lock for the consistency hash as a part
  of the DB record. The guaruntees the database offers around
  atomic insertion and constrained atomic updates offer the
  primitives necessary to ensure that only one process/thread
  can lock the record at once.

  The read_for_update method is modified to not return the hash
  in the database until an identifier is inserted into the
  current record or added as a new record. By using an UPDATE
  query with a WHERE clause restricting to the current state,
  only one of many concurrent callers to the DB will successfully
  update the rows. If a caller sees that it didn't update any
  rows, it will start the process over of trying to get the
  lock.

  If a caller observes that the same ID has the lock for
  more than 60 seconds, it will assume the holder has
  died and will attempt to take the lock. This is also done
  in a concurrency-safe UPDATE call since there may be many
  other callers may attempt to do the same thing. If it
  fails and the lock was taken by someone else, the process
  will start over.

  Some pseudo-code resembling the logic:
    read_current_lock
    if no_record:
      insert_lock
      sleep_and_retry if constraint_violation else return
    if current_is_locked and not timer_exceeded:
      sleep_and_retry
    if update_record_with_lock:
      return
    else:
      sleep_and_retry

Previously, our tests were inconsistent in their superclass; some subclassed
from congress.tests.base.TestCase, while others subclassed from
unittest.TestCase.

Our tests need to subclass from congress.tests.base.TestCase so that logging
infrastructure and other things are initialized.  This is why some tests would
not produce any log messages when the test failed.

All future tests should subclass from congress.tests.base.TestCase.

This change alters our use of assertRaises() since the congress.tests.base
class's implementation of assertRaises() does not support the ""with"" syntax.

In order to be able to move some validations and general checks, that are
currently done in the transport, down to the storage layer, we need to
wrap the methods being overloaded with other methods that are defined in
the base class. This will allow us to add logic before and after the
actual method call if needed.

This is the first patch of a series of patches that will update all the
storage controllers.

The tests in test_wsgi should stop the server once the test is over,
otherwise it would continue running and potentially affect other

Also, there were a couple of tests that did
environment.use_eventlet() in setUp, which has no effect since this
was already done in keystone.tests.core, and it's incorrect to put
this in a test setUp since it would affect other tests as it's an

Instead of retaining raw callbacks in the task event listeners
retain a wrapper class that can provide useful properties and
methods that the task can then use to perform its callback actions
on.

This helps decouple the task base class from knowing about how to
call the callbacks with the right parameters and checking for equals
and so-on, making the functionality simpler and more isolated.

As discussed in Paris and subsequently discussed on the mailing-list,
switch stable branch maintenance to project-specific teams under the
guidance and leadership of the stable-maint-core team.

All $PROJECT-stable-maint teams in Gerrit should be owned by
stable-maint-core which will vet the addition of members to make sure
they are aware of the Stable Branch policy.

Remarks:
- Sahara was already using their own team, proposed change will align
  them to use a specific team instead.
- Designate is still incubated and therefore stable-maint-core doesn't
  own their stable branches yet. Proposed change fixes ACL to reflect
  that.
- All projects still inherit openstack-stable-maint from the
  all-projects ACL, but this will be removed once the transition is
  over.

Because of the way the testing part of the specs template is written
you basically get one of 3 throw away answers in the spec.

1) we'll have unit tests
2) we'll add tempest tests
3) we'll have 3rd party testing

However, the specs *rarely* actually talk about what's actually
important to test in the feature. Which means those are all kind of
throw away statements.

A much more useful piece of information is to ask what are the
critical scenarios to test for a feature. What's really important that
works. What's really important that it doesn't break something
else. What are some interesting edge cases we should be careful about.

When a volume is attached to an instance, the disk_type and
adapter_type are found by making a get_dynamic_property vim
call to the instance. If the adapter_type returned is
""ide"", the volume attach fails with ""operation cannot be
performed in the current state"". This is because VMware IDE
adapter does not support disk hotplug.

Instead of making a get_dynamic_property vim call to the
instance, it should be made to the volume (shadow VM). This
properly indicates what adapter_type is needed by the volume.
If the instance does not have a controller to support the
volume adapter_type (e.g. lsiLogic), one will be added.
If the volume adapter_type is ""ide"", a exception.Invalid will
be thrown.

This commit consists of three parts. We need to merge them
both to pass all the CI jobs:

1. Updated functional CLI tests after a change in tempest
   Also fix contains backported tests from murano-master.

2. Update DB migration tests in respect to new release of Alembic
   After alembic update output of 'history' command in alembic
   changed. This commit fixes failing unit tests.

3. Fix Murano app names:
   Names of apps used in CI were changes in murano-incubator. This
   change updates configuration of functional tests to retrieve
   apps with respect to their new names.

This patch changes the direct use of nova.db.api.compute_node_get_all()
to instead be a call to nova.objects.ComputeNodeList.get_all(), and
changes all use of dict-based accesses of data attributes to be object
attributes instead.

The largest changes come in the way that the scheduler unit tests were
set up. Instead of a bunch of dicts representing compute node and
service objects, there is now a fixtures module in
nova/tests/unit/scheduler that contains the objects used in unit tests.

Unfortunately, due to a rebase error, when the version checking
code was moved into host.py, the version_cap was re-introduced:

Nova v3 API has disappeared, and Tempest isn't testing the API on the

So it is not necessary to keep Nova v3 API tests in Tempest.

on an error response which is returned from REST API servers(nova-api,

We have a plan RestClient is implemented in tempest-lib and related
exceptions also are moved to tempest-lib.
For doing that, this patch separates an unrelated exception from

Since Fedora 20 it has been possible to use 'dnf' as a drop-in
replacement for 'yum', and it is targetted to become the default
in Fedora 22

   http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/ReplaceYumWithDNF

There are many benefits of 'dnf' over 'yum' but the biggest
from the POV of an openstack developer is its speed.

Assuming an existing running devstack install ie all required
RPMs already installed on the system. Now look at how long it
takes to run stack.sh, during which yum does not have to
actually install anything

 # ./unstack.sh
 # time ./stack.sh
 real 11m12.193s
 user 10m17.129s
 sys  0m15.275s

Now, with 'export YUM=dnf' set in local.conf, run the same
test again

 # ./unstack.sh
 # time ./stack.sh
 real 0m48.610s
 user 0m28.939s
 sys  0m7.801s

So, this is showing that devstack is wasting 10 minutes just
for yum to figure out that everything is already installed.
The overhead of yum vs dnf is even worse when yum has to
acutally depsolve to install new packages.

This fix

  https://review.openstack.org/138128

breaks assignments for NUMA topologies where host cell ID
that the instance cell is pinned to is not in increasing order. The
reason for this is that the main loop of the method that will go through
the host cells (always in ascending order), and find instance cells that
match (may not be in ascending order depending on how the fitting logic
and usage of the host) but we simply append memnodes so they may end up
in the wrong order when we hit the normalization loop.

We fix this by ""pre-allocating"" the memnodes list and making sure to add
the matching memnode to the same position as the guest config cell
before hitting the normalization loop.

The Database fixture has existed for a long time, and has a large
amount of vestigial code that is no longer usable as it's masked by
other test setup. For instance, the conf fixture always sets the db
connection string to in memory db.

Simplify what the Database fixture is doing to just the inmemory
schema caching and reconstruction. Also provide a test case
demonstrating that this both sets up the db correctly, as well as
resets it after we've made changes.

Resource classes in different projects have static module
variables for creation attributes or define required attributes
as arguments of method create(). For this reason we can't use base
method create() as in CrudManager, we should override this method in
all implementations of Resource class.

By using builtin __slots__ attribute we can define attributes
needed for object creation.
With such approach we can define attributes directly in class
instead of static module variable and use them from base method
create().

Example of usage __slots__:

class Server(base.Resource):
    __slots__ = set(['name', 'image', 'flavor'])

The two regexp-based filters in exc_filters.py->_is_db_connection_error()
were both incorrectly formed.  The tests for these filters would pass
because the fixture also set the is_disconnect flag to True, which
normally would be set by SQLAlchemy, and therefore the
_raise_operational_errors_directly_filter() or possibly
the _raise_for_remaining_DBAPIError() filters would catch this,
view the is_disconnect flag as True, and promote to a DBConnectionError.
However, the _is_db_connection_error() filters are intended to
work independently of whether this flag is set; so two new tests
are added which unset the flag, and ensure that the exception messages
as given are caught here.

This patch applies upgrades to the sqlalchemy/exc_filters.py and
sqlalchemy/compat/handle_error.py compatibility layers to accommodate
new changes in SQLAlchemy 1.0.  SQLA 1.0 will now route errors that
occur upon connect through the handle_error() event, just like any other,
so that when 1.0 is present we no longer need to use
exc_filters.handle_connect_error; the method becomes a passthrough
as far as running the event handler.  Additionally, SQLAlchemy 1.0
has added the ""engine"" parameter to ExceptionContext, specifically
to suit the case when the initial connect has failed and there is
no Connection object; the compatibility layer here now emulates
this behavior for SQLAlchemy versions prior to 1.0.

This commit removes all of the network debugging gorp usage from
tempest. These were added as a crutch over a year ago to enable
real neutron testing in the gate, which was impossible to debug
at the time. This debug info is an inherent layer violation in tempest
which is only supposed to be black-box and not care about any of the
underlying internals. It also assumes a single host environment and
that tempest is running on that machine, which is mostly specific to
the gate and devtest setups. Additionally the amount of output on a
failure is staggering to the point where keeping this around is
counter-productive. If we are unable to debug issues at this point
neutron needs to improve their logging so people can figure out what
failed.

Improved the performance of unshelve instance by eliminating
downloading/copying snapshot time. All instance files will be retained in
the instance store backed by NFS on the compute node when an instance is
shelved. An existing configuration parameter “shelved_offload_time"" is used
here to indicate the instance files shouldn’t be deleted.

-1, never offload (CPU/Memory/Disks resources are not released).
0, offload when shelved (CPU/Memory/Disks resources are not released).
> 0, offload using “_poll_shelved_instances” periodic task
(CPU/Memory/Disks resources are not released).

New value will be added
-2, offload partially, release CPU/Memory but retain instance files.

Added new VM state 'SHELVED_PARTIAL_OFFLOADED' and new Task state
'SHELVING_PARTIAL_OFFLOADING', so user can identify by VM status
that, instance is partially offloaded and instance files are persisted
on the host.

Note:
To use this feature, You must configure instance path on NFS either on
all of the compute nodes or group of compute nodes defined by host aggregate.

Added new scheduling filter 'HostAggregateGroupFilter' which can filter
the host on the basis of 'host aggregate group id' stored in the
filter_properties.

DocImpact:
An existing configuration parameter “shelved_offload_time"" will be modified
here to indicate the instance files shouldn’t be deleted.

-1, never offload
0, offload when shelved
> 0, offload using “_poll_shelved_instances” periodic task

New value will be added
-2, offload partially, release CPU/Memory but retain instance files

Note: In case shelved_offload_time=-2, You must configure instance path on
NFS either on all of the compute nodes or group of compute nodes defined
by host aggregate.

If HostAggregate groups configured with same properties on multiple NFS, then
add 'HostAggregateGroupFilter' in the 'scheduler_default_filters'
configuration parameter as mentioned below:
scheduler_default_filters=HostAggregateGroupFilter,AvailabilityZoneFilter,...

On some editions of Windows / Hyper-V server the SAN policy is set
by default to ""Online All"", bringing online any disk, local or shared,
attached to the host.

Since only offline disks can be attached as passthrough disks to a Hyper-V
VM, this prevents Cinder volumes from being attached to instances,
resulting in an exception that can be particularly hard to troubleshoot
without a clear knowledge of the context.

This patch includes some details in the exception message for
troubleshooting purposes.

Previously 55-heat-config assumed that executing a hook with some
config is an idempotent operation, so it made no effort to prevent
a hook being invoked with the same config multiple times. This means
that whenever *any* deployment metadata changes *all* configs are
run against their hooks again. This would be undesirable for
non-idempotent configs, or configs which are expensive to execute.

This change writes out the config json to files in
/var/run/heat-config/deployed and uses the presence of this file to
determine whether that config has been deployed already. This also
improves the debugging experience as a single hook execution can be
triggered manually by running:
  /var/lib/heat-config/hooks/<hook> < /var/run/heat-config/deployed/<cid>.json
