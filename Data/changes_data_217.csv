Using ""--no-cache-dir"" flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages

Using --no-cache-dir flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.

Using --no-cache-dir flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages

Using --no-cache-dir flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.

Using ""--no-cache-dir"" flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages

The previous uwsgi invocation assumed that the uwsgi binary is in the
same directory as the project binaries are installed into (probably
/usr/bin).  That may not be correct -- for example if using a packaged
uwsgi on Fedora the binary will live in /usr/sbin/uwsgi (not /usr/bin
where the project files from pip are).

Switch the invocation to just find it in the path.

Additionally, grenade is disabled, otherwise we cannot land this change
without fixing stable branches first.

Switch to openstackdocstheme 2.2.1 version. Using
this version will allow especially:
* Linking from HTML to PDF document
* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_version to not auto-version the documents.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

Switch over to using the new simplestreams snap instead of using
the largely unmaintained packaging in distro (and various PPA's).

This drops direct integration with the simplestreams codebase
in preference to just calling the sstream-mirror-glance command
with the correct parameters.

This commit includes refactoring of 'custom_properties' handling
which was actually broken - there was no loading of the yaml
formatted list, which was probably overkill, so the option now
takes a space separated list of key=value pairs, for example:

 custom_properties=""hw_firmware_type=uefi hw_vif_multiqueue_enabled=true""

Fix version comparison in script wrapper.

Drop Trusty support - snaps on Trusty are awkward requiring new
kernel versions and trusty support was only retained for upgrade
purposes anyway.

Drop unsupported Xenial OpenStack versions.

Fixup CA cert handling to use any charm installed CA cert (including
that provided via the certificates relation) and install cert
to snap compatible location for simplestreams to use.

Add basic action to perform image sync on demand an refactor
the glance simplestreams sync wrapper to work within a hook
context to support the action.

Disable automatic scheduling of image syncs by default as this
tends to be racey during deployment resulting in images being
synced to glance unit local storage.

Add bionic-ussuri bundle and make it the default smoke test.

Deprecate source and key options - no longer required for
deployment with snap.

During an upgrade from Stein to Train, Kolla Ansible fails while running
TASK [cinder : Running Cinder online schema migration]

This is because the `--max_count 10` option is used, which returns 1
while migrations are processed. According to the upgrade documentation,
the command should be rerun while the exit status is 1:
https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/train/upgrade.html

This issue was introduced by a change to the image [1] which fixed a bug
in the way that the max count was interpreted, but exposed an issue in
using the max count.

This change fixes the issue by ceasing to pass MAX_NUMBER, which will
cause all migrations to occur in a single pass.

by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.

This parameter is always provided to and required by virt drivers in the tree,
yet it is defined as a kwarg (probably erroneously for compatibility reasons).
However, this puts further additions in a weird spot where it seems like the
right thing to do is add subsequent parameters to the end, forcing them to
be kwargs as well.

As evidenced by the fact that no non-virt code or tests need to be changed to
account for this, there is no reason we need this parameter to be a kwarg.

Recently a patch [1] was merged to stop adding the octavia user to the
admin project, and remove it on upgrade. However, the octavia
configuration was not updated to use the service project, causing load
balancer creation to fail.

There is also an issue for existing deployments in simply switching to
the service project. While existing load balancers appear to continue to
work, creating new load balancers fails due to the security group
belonging to the admin project. At a minimum, the deployer needs to
create a security group in the service project, and update
'octavia_amp_secgroup_list' to match its ID. Ideally the flavor and
network would also be recreated in the service project, although this
does not seem to impact operation and will result in downtime for
existing Amphorae.

This change adds a new variable, 'octavia_service_auth_project', that
can be used to set the project. The default in Ussuri is 'service',
switching to the new behaviour. For backports of this patch it should be
switched to 'admin' to maintain compatibility.

If a deployer sets 'octavia_service_auth_project' to 'admin', the
octavia user will be assigned the admin role in the admin project, as
was done previously.

STATIC_ROOT in local_settings.py should be configured
to path which is also configured in apache's config.

For debian, ubuntu binary setup it is
/var/lib/openstack-dashboard/static.

Reason why it is ""accidentaly"" working is:

For debian package:
Package is overriding STATIC_ROOT in
/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings.d/_0003_debian_static_root.py.
But this is going to be removed from settings in
https://review.opendev.org/733607.

For ubuntu package:
Ubuntu package is adding patch to package which is including
PYTHON_PATH do /usr/share/openstack-dashboard/
And also they are creating several dirty symlinks to get it working.

This patch is fixing this behaviour more clearly.

Various kolla-ansible TLS features (including backend TLS and custom CA
certs) require certificates to be passed via
$KOLLA_CONFIG_PATH/certificates/. Currently Kayobe does not support
this.

This change adds support for copying across files from
$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/kolla/certificates.

It also uses the kolla-ansible default value for
kolla_external_fqdn_cert and kolla_internal_fqdn_cert when
kolla_external_tls_cert and kolla_internal_tls_cert are respectively
not set. This allows for the standard kolla-ansible configuration
approach of dropping these certificates into the
$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/kolla/certificates directory, rather than defining
them as variables. This can be useful if using the kolla-ansible
certificates command to generate certificates for testing.

This patch removes OPAE driver package from cyborg-agent dependencies due to
the following reasons:

1. In the kolla cyborg-agent image we install OPAE, but OPAE is not
available for CentOS 8 for the moment. This will make the cyborg-agent image
unbuildable in Ussuri[0].

2. In devstack, due to the fact that OPAE packages depend on libjson0, which
is not available after Ubuntu 16.04, so cyborg can't be installed on Ubuntu
higher than 16.04 now(unless disable dependency manually). Moreover,from
cyborg's perspective, it does not need to contain any hardware driver
dependency, we can assume the admin should know about it and install the
correct version.

3. We had an agreement at Victoria PTG that we should remove.[1]

We need shared Neutron security group and its members, used
as remote group for other security groups, in order to perform
some security groups scenarios.

Remote security groups with port ranges are complex scenarios with,
depended on the SDN solution, we can observe many bootlenecks.

This patch adds two new Neutron Contexts.

""Remote Security Group"" context that is responsible for:
* creating remote security group
* creating ports in this security group
* binds the ports to one or a few more VMs in order to make those ports
  ACTIVE in Neutron.

""Remote Security Group Rules"" Neutron context is responsible for:
* Creating rules that are linked to Remote Security Group created
  by ""Remote Security Group"" context. Those rules reflects rules
  created by this openstack client command:

openstack security group rule create
    [--remote-ip <ip-address> | --remote-group <group>]

During an upgrade from Stein to Train, Kolla Ansible fails while running

This is because the `--max_count 10` option is used, which returns 1
while migrations are processed. According to the upgrade documentation,
the command should be rerun while the exit status is 1:
https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/train/upgrade.html

This issue was introduced by a change to the image [1] which fixed a bug
in the way that the max count was interpreted, but exposed an issue in
using the max count.

This change fixes the issue by ceasing to pass MAX_NUMBER, which will
cause all migrations to occur in a single pass.

Currently OSDs are added by the ceph-osd chart with zero weight
and they get reweighted to proper weights in the ceph-client chart
after all OSDs have been deployed. This causes a problem when a
deployment is partially completed and additional OSDs are added
later. In this case the ceph-client chart has already run and the
new OSDs don't ever get weighted correctly. This change weights
OSDs properly as they are deployed instead. As noted in the
script, the noin flag may be set during the deployment to prevent
rebalancing as OSDs are added if necessary.

Added the ability to set and unset Ceph cluster flags in the
ceph-client chart.

Python 2.7 and Python 3 and adds some tests.

   $ swift stat
   Only ""v3applicationcredential"" is supported for --os-auth-type

We don't really want to allow (and mostly ignore) arbitrary OS_AUTH_TYPE
values, though -- there are a whole bunch of plugins we don't remotely
support. But it seems OK to allow any of the password plugins; while we
won't actually use them (currently), we provide roughly equivalent
functionality.

Handful of other drive-bys:
 * Use a None sentinel to determine whether keystoneauth1 is installed
   instead of trying to catch a NameError.
 * Clarify error state when keystoneauth1 is not installed.
 * Fix a typo: ""sses"" -> ""sess"".

The previous uwsgi invocation assumed that the uwsgi binary is in the
same directory as the project binaries are installed into (probably
/usr/bin).  That may not be correct -- for example if using a packaged
uwsgi on Fedora the binary will live in /usr/sbin/uwsgi (not /usr/bin
where the project files from pip are).

Switch the invocation to just find it in the path.

Additionally, grenade is disabled, otherwise we cannot land this change
without fixing stable branches first.

During an upgrade from Stein to Train, Kolla Ansible fails while running
TASK [cinder : Running Cinder online schema migration]

This is because the `--max_count 10` option is used, which returns 1
while migrations are processed. According to the upgrade documentation,
the command should be rerun while the exit status is 1:
https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/train/upgrade.html

This issue was introduced by a change to the image [1] which fixed a bug
in the way that the max count was interpreted, but exposed an issue in
using the max count.

This change fixes the issue by ceasing to pass MAX_NUMBER, which will
cause all migrations to occur in a single pass.

Recently a patch [1] was merged to stop adding the octavia user to the
admin project, and remove it on upgrade. However, the octavia
configuration was not updated to use the service project, causing load
balancer creation to fail.

There is also an issue for existing deployments in simply switching to
the service project. While existing load balancers appear to continue to
work, creating new load balancers fails due to the security group
belonging to the admin project. At a minimum, the deployer needs to
create a security group in the service project, and update
'octavia_amp_secgroup_list' to match its ID. Ideally the flavor and
network would also be recreated in the service project, although this
does not seem to impact operation and will result in downtime for
existing Amphorae.

This change adds a new variable, 'octavia_service_auth_project', that
can be used to set the project. The default in Ussuri is 'service',
switching to the new behaviour. For backports of this patch it should be
switched to 'admin' to maintain compatibility.

If a deployer sets 'octavia_service_auth_project' to 'admin', the
octavia user will be assigned the admin role in the admin project, as
was done previously.

After live migrating a volume into the 3PAR driver the volume would be
unusable.  And we would no longer be able to do any operation with it.

Migrated in-use volumes cannot be renamed when migrated and therefore
need to use the ""_name_id"" field of the Volume object (volumes table in
the DB) to store the original volume's ID so the driver can locate the
volume.

The problem is that, even though the 3PAR driver sets the ""_name_id""
field, it doesn't use it for any operation, so once the volume has been
migrated and the ID of the volume no longer matches the one that was
used to create the volume (value now in ""_name_id"") it will no longer be
able to locate the volume.

This patch adds the logic necessary to locate volumes using the
""_name_id"" field.

This patch is removing chrony package
from docker host when containerized chrony is enabled.
It is also fixing issue with chrony container running
under Ubuntu docker host as noted below.

+ exec /usr/sbin/chronyd -d -f /etc/chrony/chrony.conf

2020-06-08T08:19:09Z Fatal error : Could not open configuration file /etc/chrony/chrony.conf : Permission denied

Added also removal apparmor profile for ubuntu when
containerized chrony is enabled, as chrony's package
is not removing apparmor profile, and therefore
containerized chrony is not working.

In delete_group() method the group is deleted first and
then the volume information is fetched which internally
trys to find all the related groups. As group delete request
was placed earlier than volume list and the group might be
deleted before volume list try to find the group
information, it returns 404.

This is race condition based on group is finish its deletion
before list volume requests or not.

Better is to fetch the information of volumes first and then
delete the group. And use that volume info later
to cleanup the volume also if requested.

We had updated most code to use unittest.mock instead of the third party
mock package, and we have removed it from our test-requirements.txt
file.

We still have a few imports in a form that wasn't initially caught. Now
that oslotest is dropping mock from its own requirements, we no longer
get it installed indirectly, resulting in initial import of some of our
test code to fail when it can no longer find mock with the error:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mock'

This cleans up the last few instances where we were relying on the mock
lib.

Adds the kayobe-seed-vm-centos8 CI job to configure the Zuul VM as a
seed hypervisor, and use nested virt to provision a seed VM.  This
ensures that the seed hypervisor code paths are tested.

The job uses a Cirros image for the seed VM rather than the usual CentOS
cloud image. This is to reduce bandwidth required to download the image.
It does mean that the resulting seed VM cannot be used as a seed, but
nested virt would make this slow and unreliable anyway. Cirros does not
load cdrom drivers by default, so we add the configdrive as a disk
rather than a cdrom device.

When file-backed memory is configured, it is the only ""memory"" reported
by nova and used by instances, with RAM used in caching capacity. We
should be warning users of this and insisting they explicitly configure
the '[DEFAULT] reserved_host_memory_mb' config option to 0. However,
doing so now would be breaking change. Instead, start logging a warning
instead, failing only for the truly broken combination of reserving more
file-backed memory than we have allocated.

Previously some tests were ignored under python 3 environment, this was
due to some design changes introduced by python 3.7 [1] in the SSL
module of the stdlib. These changes reactivate some of them (some other
are still skipped and needs further works).

Indeed, when we try to use requests with SSL in a monkey patched
environment we faced the following issue:

```
TypeError: wrap_socket() got an unexpected keyword argument '_context'
```

This is due to the fact that we are in a monkey patched environment
where `requests` is monkey patched too.

We don't need `request` for our needs. Indeed we can easily send
http requests through low level socket. Our main goal is to test
our wsgi server and not to test the `requests` library, and `requests`
was just used to make the code more simpler.

In our case we can implement a code dedicated to send request to our green
server, unlock our tests and move away from this bug/side effect.

These changes move away from `requests` which is badly monkey patched by
eventlet [1]. Now we use monkey patched socket and ssl to
request the green server which is executed in background. Low level
(monkey patched) modules could help us to skirt layers that are possibly
badly monkey patched on higher level modules (urllib, requests, etc...).

Mistral didn't make use of the oslo_utils ""mask_password"" methods,
leading in sensitive data leakage in its logs.

This patch corrects this security issue.
Note that it depends on oslo_utils patch adding new patterns, and
ensuring it's case-insensitive.

At present, when a cluster is patched without node_count (e.g. when
health_status and health_status_reason are patched), the node_count in
the cluster_update invocation contains cluster.node_count instead of
default_ng_worker.node_count which causes unexpected behaviour when a
cluster has additional nodegroups (e.g. the default-worker size gets
incremented by 1 if the additional nodegroup has 1 worker each time the
cluster is patched).

This PS fixes this issue by using default_ng_worker.node_count if path
""/node_count"" is not present in the patch object.

This patch does two things:

1) Use the tox virtualenv python interpreter to run tasks which set up the
host initial SSH keys. This is required to run the first test-prepare-keys
playbook to allow ansible to ssh to localhost. See [1].

2) Pre-determine the python interpreter to use for further ansible tasks
beyond the key preparation in the test-ansible-functional bash script and
pass the value into test-vars.yml via the PYTHON_INTERP environment var.

This second approach is required becasue it is not possible to set
the ansible python interpreter based on ansible_distribution, or any other
ansible facts because to do that would require the interpreter already
to be correctly configured to gather ansible facts, which creates a
circular problem.

Changes [1] and [2] change the way the build-sphinx-docs jobs work to
not run them on master, use openstack-tox-docs based templates instead.

For networking-dpm, it used the jobs and also the new template. Manual
building shows that tox -e docs works fine without neutron, so remove
the extra build-sphinx-docs jobs.

For valence, use also a template for releasenotes.

This patch removes OPAE driver package from cyborg-agent dependencies due to
the following reasons:

1. In the kolla cyborg-agent image we install OPAE, but OPAE is not
available for CentOS 8 for the moment. This will make the cyborg-agent image
unbuildable in Ussuri[0].

2. In devstack, due to the fact that OPAE packages depend on libjson0, which
is not available after Ubuntu 16.04, so cyborg can't be installed on Ubuntu
higher than 16.04 now(unless disable dependency manually). Moreover,from
cyborg's perspective, it does not need to contain any hardware driver
dependency, we can assume the admin should know about it and install the
correct version.

3. We had an agreement at Victoria PTG that we should remove.[1]

Make grenade jobs non-voting until virtualenv issue is fixed.

This is a combination of 2 commits.
This is the 1st commit message:

Use packaged uwsgi on Fedora and Ubuntu

Building uwsgi from source was a workaround that was introduced a long
time ago, it doesn't seem like it is needed anymore and will actually
fail for Ubuntu 20.04.

Also it doesn't match what will happen for most real-world
installations, so let's try to get back to using distro packages. We'll
still use the source install for RHEL/Centos, it remains to be tested
whether we can get back to using distro versions there, too.

This is the commit message #2:

Use uwsgi binary from path

All these uwsgi invocations assume that the uwsgi binary is in the
same directory as their project binaries are installed into (probably
/usr/bin).  That may not be correct -- for example if using a packaged
uwsgi on Fedora the binary will live in /usr/sbin/uwsgi (not /usr/bin
where the project files from pip are).

Switch invocations to just find it in the path.
