In DVR enabled environment, after we associated a floating
IP to a VM, when we restart L3-agent on the same compute
node, the L3-agent will miss to create rtr_fip_subnet for
router_info. The previous floating IP can still work, but
new associated floating IPs to VMs related to the same router
on this L3-agent will fail to configure and not work. This
patch will fix this.

The method create_dvr_fip_interfaces in dvr_router.py will
invoke fip_ns.create_rtr_2_fip_link, and the later one will
create rtr_fip_subnet, consider VMs related to the same router
will share the same rtr_fip_subnet, so processing here should
run only once for those VMs, once rtr_fip_subnet is created.
Current code will check dist_fip_count then decide to invoke
fip_ns.create_rtr_2_fip_link or not.

dist_fip_count should be zero if a router related VMs never
have been associated with any floating IPs before. But if a
router has floating IPs associated to its related VMs, after
it is restared, dist_fip_count will be non-zero, and this is
the point this patch try to fix. And for case rtr_fip_subnet
has been created, both dist_fip_count and is_fisrt will be
false, and fip_ns.create_rtr_2_fip_link will be no more need
to be invoked.

The previous version would fetch neutron data once before repeatedly
checking the Congress table for equivalent data.  This causes a race
condition because the data can change over time.  For example, port
status starts off as BUILD and later changes to ACTIVE.  If the test
first samples neutron and finds that the status is BUILD, the test

already changed to ACTIVE and never change back to BUILD.  This causes
test failures.

The warn function was putting content into a side log file which made
it kind of hard to keep an eye on when warnings were actually being
issued. Let's just get this into the main output stream.

The calling of the warn function in git_timed was also incorrect, so
the output would not have been what we expected. This solves that as
well.

The existing logic was overly complicated and missed out on those hosts
whose services were disabled.

This is a complete rewrite that makes use of a single aggregate query,
thereby bypassing a lot of the extra logic needed by the old code.

Fixes an issue in objects.AggregateList.get_by_metadata_key() where
filtering by an empty list of hosts will return metadata for all hosts.

Also removes a call to db.aggregate_metadata_get_by_metadata_key() to
avoid the need for special handling due to that method returning
metadata as sets of values instead of strings and also because the same
metadata is already fetched in another method.

The way the query was being performed previously, we would not see any
instances that didn't have a row in instance_extra. This could happen if
an instance hasn't been touched for several releases, or if the data
set is old.

The fix is a simple change to use outerjoin instead of join. This patch
includes a test that ensures that instances with no instance_extra rows
are included in the migration. If we query an instance without such a
row, we create it before doing a save on the instance.

The recent compute rpc api version bump missed out on the security group

One possible reason is that both compute and security group client side

mistakes like this.

This change eliminates future problems like this by combining them into

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

Keystone endpoints are created using python-keystoneclient which uses
Keystone API, which means that keystone service should be already
running. The dependency to run keystone db_sync before *::keystone::auth
is not strong enough, so it is replaced with dependency on keystone
service (which in turn is subscribed to keystone db_sync).

Since nova_floating_range depends on nova::keystone::auth, this will
also ensure that keystone service is running before floating IP ranges
are created with nova-network.

The wait-for-haproxy-nova-backend hack is removed: nova_floating_range
already depends on nova-api class (which declares nova-api service) and
on openstack::ha::nova class which reloads haproxy and declares nova-api
service dependency on keystone haproxy services (which in turn depend on
keystone service and also reload haproxy). With all these dependencies
in place, both keystone and nova services are running and registered
with haproxy before floating IP ranges are created.

Commit bd8329b34098436d18441a8129f3f20af53c2b91 added code to delay
sending a STOPPED lifecycle event for Xen domains to try and ease a race
during reboot where the STOPPED event is sent after the instance is
running again after the reboot operation completed and the
instance.task_state is None. This would trigger handling in the compute
manager which would assume the instance shouldn't be running and shuts
it down.  Since the instance is being shutdown, it's task_state is
'powering-off' when the lifecycle STARTED event comes in shortly after
the STOPPED event and it's ignored in _sync_instance_power_state.

The change here is to remove the Xen restriction because there is a
recreate (on Icehouse and Juno) with virt_type=KVM, so we can assume
this is racy for any configuration of libvirt and the reboot operation
and should add the delay for all virt types. The detailed logs with the
recreate are attached in the bug report.

Test test_delete_router_interface_in_use_by_vpnservice attaches subnet
to router interface and creates vpn service with this router and subnet.
Then it tries to delete the router interface and expects 409(HTTPConflict)
as return code, as this router interface is used by vpn service.

when the test file(test_vpn_db.py) is loaded, it imports vpn_db,
which subscribes follwing vpn callbacks
    vpn_callback, resources.ROUTER_GATEWAY, events.BEFORE_DELETE)
    vpn_callback, resources.ROUTER_INTERFACE, events.BEFORE_DELETE)
for router_interface resource with before_delete event.

When we run this test, _confirm_router_interface_not_in_use function
will be called, which notifies the vpn_callback function.
vpn_callback function raises 409 error as it is using router interface.

This is expected behaviour and test was passing previously.

With the change https://review.openstack.org/#/c/174588 ,
setup_test_registry_instance() is called which creates callbacksManager
(the previous callbacks subscribed by vpn_db.subscribe were overriden as a result)
So now there are no callbacks, call for router delete will be success,
and test will fail as it is not getting expected status.

Now we will again subscribe for the callbacks for the new callbacksManager(
which is created by setup_test_registry_instance()), so that vpn_callback
will called, which raises exception.
As this will be the expected status for the test case, test case will pass.

This patch is also applicable for the test case
test_delete_external_gateway_interface_in_use_by_vpnservice

In newly released ply 3.6 function yacc() of the yacc module no longer
accepts 'None' as the 'tabmodule' keyword parameter and expects a valid
string instead.
Meanwhile, the tabmodule file is not created unless write_tables is set
to True.

This patchset provides such a string and ensures that it is unique.
Omitting the 'tabmodule' parameter at all could possibly do the trick as
well, however that would mean that the parameter would get its default
value - 'parsetab' - which could potentially lead to a minor security
vulnerability if the the system somehow had got a malicious 'parsetab'
module (as yacc attempts to load the generated tables from module
specified by 'tabmodule' before proceeding to grammar generation).
Assigning a random value to this parameter prevents such a situation.

This patch also fixes the ply requirement to <=3.6 to prevent future
gate breakages due to unexpected changes in ply.

This change set provides a mechanism that listens for port provisions
and will dynamically update the Client Network Adapter (CNA) to have the
correct VLAN per the neutron port specification.

This has to be done asynchronously because when nova creates the port,
it doesn't have the VM created yet.  There is a very small delay.  So
the new looping mechanism will wait for a short period of time before
checking.

This should ensure that when a VM is active, it is on the appropriate
VLAN.

Remotable methods in a new TaskLog object need to serialize datatimes
passed as positional args. Right now the serialize_args() decorator only
look at kwargs.

In addition, serialization of datetimes need to use timeutils.strtime()
to match the deserialization code in the db api. Also makes this change
for serialization of kwargs to partially solve a bug with how this
decorator is used in the BandwidthUsage object.

A follow-up patch closes the bug by adding conversion back to datetimes
using existing db api helper method convert_objects_related_datetimes(),
which in turn makes use of timeutils.parse_strtime().

was a never fully implemented idea in the past, and it's existence in

The previous commit that changed the service description
from Openstack to OpenStack actually introduced a bug that means
that users cannot upgrade between those two versions of the code.

An attempt to use this manifest to upgrade from earlier versions
of the code before this change was made is currently not supported
because keystone_service does not support updating it's description.

This commit adds the service description as a class parameter so that
folks using older version of the module can update it to the incorrectly
spelled version.

The use of the builtin unittest test loader was silently dropping tests
that couldn't be imported.

This change also drops the retargetable path from discovery in the api
path due to a previously-masked configuration problem, and fixes an
invalid import in a functional testing fixture module.

Fullstack tests are also disabled temporarily pending a fix for #1446261.

The devstack unittests source stackrc which means they expect to be able
to determine the HOST_IP of a host. Unfortunately devstack filters out
any IPs that lie in the FIXED_RANGE when doing so. Some of our HPCloud
VMs get host IPs in 10.0.0.0/24 which is the default FIXED_RANGE leading
to invalid test failures when stackrc fails to determine a HOST_IP.

The selected address range was semi chosen by python
random.randint(0,255) and is not special in any other way.

Declaring the openstackclient class from keystone
means that no other puppet class can include the client
libs.

This is not a good idea since the client libraries will
commonly be added to all roles.

This patch ensures that the class is only included and
not declared unless a value other than the default of
ensure=>present needs to be set for the package.

This case was already covered by the existing spec tests
so no further tests were added.

The state machine incorrectly models the transition from CLEANFAIL to
to CLEANING state. The spec [1] mentions that management of CLEANING
tasks should be handled in the same fashion as ZAPPING tasks. For
ZAPFAIL:
    Nodes that transition into ZAPFAIL will automatically enter
    maintenance mode, as failure to ZAP a machine usually indicates
    a hardware failure or something else that requires remote hands
    to fix.

Nodes in CLEANFAIL should do a similar thing as ZAPFAIL; they are
put in maintenance mode, but shouldn't be able to transition directly
to CLEANING.

This patch also clarifies the documentation for the transition
CLEANFAIL -> MANAGEABLE.

The swift installation process requires access to the Ubuntu backports
repository to install the liberasurecode1 and liberasurecode-dev packages. In
the hpcloud environments used in OpenStack-CI the backport repository is not
implemented, so we need to ensure that it's there if it hasn't already been
configured. This patch does that as part of the AIO bootstrap process.

Additionally, heat now requires python-saharaclient >= 0.9.0 and we bump here
to allow heat to install successfully.

Note that both issues are causing the gate to fail and need to be addressed
together to get a successful gate.

This fix prevents loading of unsigned ubuntu kernel in UEFI secure
boot environment when image is created using 'iso' element.

'iso' element uses 'linux' and 'initrd' modules of grub2 to load
kernel and initrd respectively. The grub2 implementation of Ubuntu
can load unsigned kernel when these modules are used.

Ubuntu has Grub2 modules 'linuxefi' and 'initrdefi' which exits
boot process if unsigned kernel is used in UEFI secure boot mode.
The 'iso' element should use these modules in grub.cfg to prevent
loading of unsigned kernel when node is booted in the UEFI secure
boot environment.

'linuxefi' and 'initrdefi' works seamlessly when node is booted in
normal UEFI boot mode (non-secure).

Fedora do not have this issue. This fix has been tested in Fedora
environment. It works fine.

ubuntu-signed element would install 'linux-signed-image-generic' that
provides signed kernel that can be used for deploy in UEFI secure boot mode.

Package 'linux-signed-image-generic' ships signed kernel with extension
'.efi.signed' (Ex. '/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-49-generic.efi.signed').

The kernel modules directory for signed kernel and unsigned kernel is same.
It is without 'efi.signed' extension to its name. This is different from normal
practice of directory naming in '/lib/modules' (Ex. For signed kernel
'vmlinuz-3.13.0-49-generic.efi.signed', modules directory is
'/lib/modules/3.13.0-49-generic').
This needed some changes in '/lib/ramdisk-functions' and 'ramdisk' element to
copy kernel modules.

The signed kernel package contains both signed and unsigned kernel. The
unsiged kernel is without extension '.efi.signed' (Ex.
'/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-49-generic'). This required change into
'/lib/img-functions' and 'baremetal' element to pick up signed kernel version
when this element is used.

shouldn't use iterator in this place. Use list of `stack_id`

For py2 we can use .keys(), but .keys() method returns `view`
in py3 and this will lead to the same error as with using
six.iterkeys(). Apply list() to the result given by .keys() to
produce the same behaviour for py2 and py3.
Also refactor tests to make sure that there are no problems
with iterators.

Confirmed this after an IRC conversation (because the pastebin linked in
the comment expired) with Joshua Harlow, who wrote the said comment.

Reasoning behind the comment ""This doesn't seem to get inherited"" is
that many moons ago when creating a qcow2 overlay based on a base image,
apparently, the overlay didn't inherit the 'cluster_size' from the
parent image. It's not the case any more as of today:

  $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 base.qcow2 1G
  Formatting 'base.qcow2', fmt=qcow2 size=1073741824 encryption=off cluster_size=65536 lazy_refcounts=off

  $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b ./base.qcow2 -o backing_fmt=qcow2 overlay1.qcow2
  Formatting 'overlay1.qcow2', fmt=qcow2 size=1073741824 backing_file='./base.qcow2' backing_fmt='qcow2' encryption=off cluster_size=65536 lazy_refcounts=off

The 'cluster_size' of the base and overlay images match.

So, remove the TODO item and the URL to expired pastebin.

PS: Please, let's not add pastebins in code -- they expire. If we're
referring to some content from random websites, at least a concise
summary should be noted in the commit message for permanent archival.

In order to set corrent pinning, we have to use repo's metadata and
that means download repo's Release file, parse it and create pinning
based on it. In that case we'll use all available pinning rules, so
all possible issues will be up to repo maintainer and not because
we're using error prone approach.

Currently, containers' supervisor configs don't have the Fuel version
in the command line. It means that when supervisor tries to start a
container its version retrieved on fly from the '/etc/fuel/version.yaml'.
Since Fuel 6.1, the '/etc/fuel/version.yaml` has to be new, because
otherwise the 'host-upgrade.pp' will use incorrect current version.
Unfortunately, if '/etc/fuel/version.yaml' is new and the puppet
upgrades Docker package, the Docker containers will be stopped and
they won't up again because 'detecting container version on fly' will
give us wrong result (e.g. 6.1 instead of 6.0). So, the only thing
we can do is to set fixed container version in supervisor's configs,
so it won't rely on current state of '/etc/fuel/version.yaml'.

Adding filter_function to capabilities of PureISCIDriver.  Return
total_volumes as well for use with filter_function.

This will open a way for admins to prevent Cinder from scheduling
volumes on a Pure backend once it has reached the array’s limits. The
primary use case for this is volume limits. An example of a
filter_function that will prevent this issue would be:

filter_function=""capabilities.total_volumes < 500”

This will prevent any issues with Purity versions that are limited to
500 volumes.

Without that filter_function the scheduler will continue to try and
schedule volume creation if space is available instead of selecting
another backend. The end result would be volume creation fails and the
volume is in an error state even though there are backends available
that could have handled it.

DocImpact: This means the PureISCSIDriver will now respect the
filter_function config option. Special Pure specific fields to filter
off of need to be added to the driver config manual.

This routine in policy.py used to have a backward compatibility
check to ensure proper behaviour even when the policy.json file
did not have a specific 'context_is_admin' policy.
However, this backward compatibility check does not work. It
appears indeed that it has been broken for several release cycles;
it is also possible that actually it never worked.
When the 'context_is_admin' policy is not in the policy.json file
the enforcer simply ends up evaluating whatever is the default
policy configured there.

Therefore this patch:
- Removes the backward compatibility check, since it does not work
- Fails, for safety, check_is_admin if 'context_is_admin' policy is
  not specified
- Fixeds check_is_advsvc in the same way (the backward compatibility
  check never made any sense for this function)
- Fixes unit tests adding appropriate tests for check_is_admin and
  check_is_advsvc

The VMware driver currently identifies a hypervisor as:

  <mo_id>(<cluster name>)

Cluster name is not unique, and mo_id is only unique in the scope of a
single vCenter, so the above can produce duplicate names when managing
clusters with the same name in multiple vCenters. This is especially
likely to occur in lab setups.

This change alters the above format to the following, which uniquely
identifies a cluster globally:

  <mo_id>.<vCenter uuid>

service.py had some code where the child process would catch the
SIGTERM from the parent just so it could exit with 1 status rather
than with an indication that it exited due to SIGTERM. When
shutting down the parent doesn't care in what way the child ended,
only that they're all gone, so this code is unnecessary.

Also, for some reason this caused the child to never exit while
there was an open connection from a client. Probably something
with eventlet and signal handling.

The TC approved a cross project spec to stop putting db downgrade into
project migration repos:
https://github.com/openstack/openstack-specs/blob/master/specs/no-downward-sql-migration.rst
This was done after quite a bit of feedback from the operator community,
and everyone was good with it.

This implements that spec for Nova, adjust the tests to pass
accordingly, and changes the test which requires downgrade functions
to one that prohibits them.

Although the driver states it doesn't support server shares
in the configuration file via the driver_handles_share_servers property,
they are still being executed and failing by tempest.

This issue is not being caught in the gate because the default driver
supports both modes. This change uses the job configuration to ensure both
settings are aligned for the tests run after the pre_test_hook is called
but before the post_test_hook is called.

According to the manila tempest configuration, the tempest.conf
also needs multitenancy configuration set to false so that they are skipped [1]

Currently our angular test dependencies are pinned, and pinned rather
low.  I'd like to both increase the versions numbers and unpin the
version numbers.

npm allows some pretty cool version-number-controls:
https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#dependencies

I claim that since we're dealing with dev-dependencies, we are more than
ok using the ""^"" or ""~"" syntax.

NOTE: karma-jasmine >= 0.3 requires a separate install of jasmine-core.

Also, upgrading the jasmine version will allow us to run a single
test-suite or test:
describe -> fdescribe
it -> fit

There are various cases where the DHCP agent will try to
create a DHCP port for a network and there will be a failure.
This has primarily been caused by a lack of available IP addresses
in the allocation pool. Trying to fix all availability corner cases
on the server side will be very difficult due to race conditions between
multiple ports being created, the dhcp_agents_per_network parameter, etc.

This patch just stops the resync attempt on the agent side if a failure
is caused by an IP address generation problem. Future updates to the subnet
will cause another attempt so if the tenant does fix the issue they will
get DHCP service.

Issues resolved in this patch include the following changes:
* A temporary volume is created on the destination host before migrating
the data from the source. However, if the creation of this volume fails,
its record will be left in the database as redundant information. This
patch will remove the database record if the creation fails.

* If attaching the remote dest volme fails at initialize_connection
due to timeout, we need to terminate the connection. Otherwise, the dest
volume will not be released and successfully deleted.

When checking for ports that are still in use on a DVR router,
the L3 agent scheduler makes the assumption that a port's
network must be owned by the same tenant. This isn't always
true as the admin could have created a shared network that
other tenants may use. The result of this assumption is that
the router associated with the shared network may not be
unscheduled from a VM host when the last VM (created by a
non-admin tenant) using the shared network is deleted from
the compute node.

The owner of a VM may not own all the ports of a shared
network.  Other tenants may have VMs using the same shared
network running on the same compute node. Also the VM owner
may not own the router ports. In order to check whether a
router can be unscheduled from a node has to be run with
admin context so all the ports associated with router are
returned from database queries.

This patch fixes this problem by using the admin context to
make the queries needed for the DVR scheduler to make the
correct unschedule decision.

Adjust registration of ami image in boto tests to be compatible with
stackforge ec2api.

This change set kernel_id and ramdisk_id properties of an ami image. As
a result the image could be used to run an instance without specifying
of these additional images.

Nova EC2 doesn't support set of these attributes in register image
operation (LP #954335). So a run operation must specify both of them.
Ec2api doesn't support specifying these in run operation (LP #1441138).
So registration of ami image must set both of them.

Now both requirements are satisfied, thus this testcase should work
properly for both Nova EC2 and ec2api.

Note: NeutronPhysicalBridge is named differently in the overcloud
template (HypervisorNeutronPhysicalBridge). This is the only parameter
checked that isn't named exactly the same, hopefully there aren't any
others.

The package pinning issue in galera is related to how the pref file
or the lack there of is being created. The pref file for apt pinning
needs to be locked down to the release organisation which is providing
the extra packages.

A filter plugin was added to allow for a url to be parsed for the
purpose of pinning to an origin.

This is the recommended solution per the upstream mariadb
documentation as found here:
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/installing-mariadb-deb-files/

The PPA being used for modern rsyslog is exhibiting signs that its
prone to failure. Upon further review the V8 stable PPA is tied
directly to launchpad which is a known failure domain. To correct
this issue the PPA was removed and the additional repo from within
the rsyslog_* roles was made optional.

The base image appears to have a package that conflicts with MariaDB packages,
so the AIO bootstrap script is set to remove the conflicting packages.

oslo.messaging now implements rabbitmq heartbeat.

py-amqp (the underlying low library to connect to rabbitmq) has a
working support of heartbeat since 1.4.0. So we need at least
that version.

Given that Trusty has 3.0.7 of kombu and the authors have indicated
that amqp>=1.3.3,<2.0 would work with that version, we can use
amqp 1.4.0 with kombu 3.0.7.

So this change raises the kombu requirement to '>=3.0.7' and
amqp to '>=1.4.0'

This patch adds support for choosing a requirements file, based on the
current OS, with the format 'requirements-{osname}'. This can be combined
with the current approach of choosing a requirement file based on the
Python version. The motivation for this is to replace conditional
choosing of packages inside setup.py.

When one thread is running the coordinator heartbeat()
periodically and another is using the lock(s) it should
be possible to correctly make this happen/work without
errors of the type of:

AttributeError: '_thread._local' object has no
                attribute 'token'

This happens because the coordinator heartbeat() method
calls into each current lock(s) heartbeat()
method (which then extends the lock via the locks
extend() method); when this is using thread local storage
this fails with the above error.

So to avoid this explicitly disallow using thread
local token storage by ensuring we pass in the right param
to the underlying redis lock.

The current scheme of ""Merge if necessary"" creates a convoluted history
that you can't effectively use bisect or blame on.

Git log is becomes useless as it shows a mix of merge and FF commits.
Example:
  ea577bb Merge ""Normalize projects.yaml""
  be66f7f Merge ""Change Magnum's bandit gate""
  ea77167 Normalize projects.yaml

Git show doesn't work on most of the history:
Example:
$ git show ea577bb
commit ea577bbf3650a2b0c1ed76d2f94fea336da23cd8
Merge: be66f7f ea77167
Author: Jenkins <jenkins@review.openstack.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 23 07:10:15 2015 +0000

    Merge ""Normalize projects.yaml""

<<NOTICE NO DIFF>>

Also add the fact that git blame dates get displayed out of order on you
get a whole soup of git mess.

Merge commits only work if the maintainers takes care of merging whole
features at once and only use merges. Gerrit doesn't work that way and
parts of features get interleaved. This means that by using merge
commits you effectively make the git history unhelpful and the git tree
a confusing mess. Moving to cherry-pick or ff-only fixes those issues
and creates a clean definitive history for the master branch.

We choose ff-only as the project is in it's early state so things are
changing rapidly and we don't have many automated tests so we prefer
that developers manually rebase and retest changes before we can commit
them. In the future we will probably move to a cherry-pick model so that
trivial merges are done on the server and don't require a new patch-set.

This change removes all SSH-related components, their configuration

SSH is such a low-level service (from the perspective of any operator
deploying a cloud), that it is reasonable to assume that (or provide

Without this change, there is a significant liklihood of confusion

Henderson,kyleh,"Add the 'traits' parameter to pypowervm Response

A recent commit in pypowervm now requires a 'traits' parameter
to be specified on a Response object. Updated the unit tests
to supply 'None' since traits are not used in the testing.

Skip the epoch in the packages' file names in order to not confuse
debootstrap (which fails if the deb package file name contains the colon
character). In order to avoid the problem download the base packages
in the same manners as others instead of copying them from multistrap
cache (it's multistrap which modifies the packages' file names).

rhel7 and centos7 images are both only available on x86_64 arch.
if $ARCH is misconfigured, some strange error will happen during the build.
For example, DIB will try to install EPEL i386 on the 64bit root system.

For the record, tripleo-incubator $NODE_ARCH default value is i386. The
problem will happend as soon as the default value is used with one of
these root elements.

This commit ensure the $ARCH is set to amd64 as soon as the centos7 or
rhel7 root element are used.
