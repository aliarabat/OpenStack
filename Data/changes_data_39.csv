In the fix for bug 1839560 [1][2], soft-deleted compute nodes may be
restored, to ensure we can reuse ironic node UUIDs as compute node
UUIDs. While this seems to largely work, it results in some nasty errors
being generated [3]:

    InvalidRequestError This session is in 'inactive' state, due to the
    SQL transaction being rolled back; no further SQL can be emitted
    within this transaction.

This happens because compute_node_create is decorated with
pick_context_manager_writer, which begins a transaction. While
_compute_node_get_and_update_deleted claims that calling a second
pick_context_manager_writer decorated function will begin a new
subtransaction, this does not appear to be the case.

This change removes pick_context_manager_writer from the
compute_node_create function, and adds a new _compute_node_create
function which ensures the transaction is finished if
_compute_node_get_and_update_deleted is called.

The new unit test added here fails without this change.

This change marks the removal of the final FIXME from the functional
test added in [4].

We saw in the field that the pci_devices table can end up in
inconsistent state after a compute node HW failure and re-deployment.
There could be dependent devices where the parent PF is in available
state while the children VFs are in unavailable state. (Before the HW
fault the PF was allocated hence the VFs was marked unavailable).

In this state this PF is still schedulable but during the
PCI claim the handling of dependent devices in the PCI tracker fill fail
with the error: ""Attempt to consume PCI device XXX from empty pool"".

The reason of the failure is that when the PF is claimed, all the
children VFs are marked unavailable. But if the VF is already
unavailable such step fails.

One way the deployer might try to recover from this state is to remove
the VFs from the hypervisor and restart the compute agent. The compute
startup already has a logic to delete PCI devices that are unused and
not reported by the hypervisor. However this logic only removed devices
in 'available' state and ignored devices in 'unavailable' state.

If a device is unused and the hypervisor is not reporting the device any
more then it is safe to delete that device from the PCI tracker. So this
patch extends the logic to allow deleting 'unavailable' devices. There
is a small window when dependent PCI device is in 'unclaimable' state.
From cleanup perspective this is an analogous state. So it is also
added to the cleanup logic.

During the testing If9ab424cc7375a1f0d41b03f01c4a823216b3eb8 we noticed
that the unit test cases of PciTracker._set_hvdev are changing and
leaking global state leading to unstable tests.

To reproduce on master, duplicate the
test_set_hvdev_remove_tree_maintained_with_allocations test case and run
PciDevTrackerTestCase serially. The duplicated test case will fail with

  File ""/nova/nova/objects/pci_device.py"", line 238, in _from_db_object
  setattr(pci_device, key, db_dev[key])
  KeyError: 'id'

This is caused by the fact that the test data is defined on module
level, both _create_tracker and _set_hvdevs modifies the devices
passed to them, and some test mixes passing db dicts to _set_hvdevs
that expects pci dicts from the hypervisor.

This patch fixes multiple related issues:
* always deepcopy what _create_tracker takes as that list is later
  returned to the PciTracker via a mock and the tracker might modify
  what it got

* ensure that _create_tracker takes db dicts (with id field) while
  _set_hvdevs takes pci dicts in the hypervisor format (without id
  field)

* always deepcopy what is passed to _set_hvdevs as the PciTracker modify
  what it gets.

* normalize when the deepcopy happens to give a safe patter for future
  test cases

administrative context no matter what the requesting user's
permissions are.

When trying to attach a volume to an already running instance the nova-api
requests the nova-compute service to create a BlockDeviceMapping. If the
nova-api does not receive a response within `rpc_response_timeout` it will
treat the request as failed and raise an exception.

There are multiple cases where nova-compute actually already processed the
request and just the reply did not reach the nova-api in time (see bug report).
After the failed request the database will contain a BlockDeviceMapping entry
for the volume + instance combination that will never be cleaned up again.
This entry also causes the nova-api to reject all future attachments of this
volume to this instance (as it assumes it is already attached).

To work around this we check if a BlockDeviceMapping has already been created
when we see a messaging timeout. If this is the case we can safely delete it
as the compute node has already finished processing and we will no longer pick
it up.
This allows users to try the request again.

A previous fix was abandoned but without a clear reason ([1]).

Currently nova.utils.tpool_execute() only works by chance. And as the
bug report shows there are env where it fails.

The nova.utils.tpool_execute() call tries to uses eventlet.tpool.execute
but the tpool module is not imported by the utils module only eventlet.
In devstack it works by chance as the wsgi init actually imports
eventlet.tpool indirectly via:

This change refactors how the ceilometer service user and group are

- The ceilometer service user and group are created by the common

- Introduces the configuration knob to disable user/group management.
  This would be useful in the case where all service users are

Since we're bind-mounting /run within containers, we have an unwanted
/run/.containerenv file exposed on the host.

subscription-manager checks for that file[1] in order to know whether
it's running within a container or not.

With dnf ""subscription-manager"" plugin, we are facing a major issue,
where the repository list is updated.

While it's not that a big issue if using Red Hat CDN, it is actually
really bad when we're using a Satellite instance: all the repo list
are updated to point to some non-existing path on the CDN, leading
to a broken deploy, usually at step_4, when the deployment wants to
install net-snmp (it's already present, but dnf will fail while
trying to update its repository and failing to get the repomd.xml).

This patch takes advantage of a block in the rhsm.py nested in
subscription-manager[2] in order to ensure it will be using the correct
rhsm.conf, and stop defaulting on the CDN.

It shouldn't make any difference with a non-Satellite deployment.

As a final note, this repository override is a new feature in
subscription-manager, shipped on el9. We'll therefore need to backport
this patch down to Wallaby, in order to get it in osp-17 cycle.

checks progress of migration on source host, if for any reason
we hit infrastructure issue involving a DB/RPC/libvirt-timeout
failure, an Exception is raised to the nova-compute service and
instance/migration is set to ERROR state.

The issue is that we may let live-migration job running out of nova
control. At the end of job, guest is resumed on target host while
nova still reports it on source host, this may lead to a split-brain
situation if instance is restarted.

This change proposes to abort live-migration job if issue occurs
during _live_migration_monitor.

Today Nova updates the mac_address of a direct-physical port to reflect
the MAC address of the physical device the port is bound to. But this
can only be done before the port is bound. However during migration Nova
does not update the MAC when the port is bound to a different physical
device on the destination host.

This patch extends the libvirt virt driver to provide the MAC address of
the PF in the pci_info returned to the resource tracker. This
information will be then persisted in the extra_info field of the
PciDevice object.

Then the port update logic during migration, resize, live
migration, evacuation and unshelve is also extended to record the MAC of
physical device in the port binding profile according to the device on
the destination host.

The related neutron change Ib0638f5db69cb92daf6932890cb89e83cf84f295
uses this info from the binding profile to update the mac_address field
of the port when the binding is activated.

Fixes an issue where access rules failed to validate:

    service_type in [keystone_authtoken] to allow access rule validation

I've used the values from the endpoint. This was mostly a straight
forward copy and paste, except:

- versioned endpoints e.g cinderv3 where I stripped the version
- monasca has multiple endpoints associated with a single service. For
  this, I concatenated logging and monitoring to be logging-monitoring.

When changing the /etc/pki/qemu certs, there is no need to
restart/reload any (modular libvirt) service. Those certs are either
loaded when QEMU VM is booted, or dynamically loaded into QEMU when a
live migration takes place. For the libvirt certs in /etc/pki/libvirt
though we need to either restart 'libvirtd.service' (what we already
do in the monolithic world), or restart 'virtproxyd.service' (modular
world). No need to restart 'virtqemud.service in modular world.

Before reloading container via systemctl, attempt a more graceful
virt-admin command to reload certificates.

OVS translates the QoS and associated queue registers,
attached to a port, into ""tc"" linux-htb classfull traffic
shaper, applied on the port.

OVS creates a ""tc"" root class on the port device. On top of
this root class, the queues are represented as child ""tc""
classes. In order to define a ""min-rate"" value (""tc rate""),
a ""max-rate"" value (""tc ceil"") must be provided and higher than
""min-rate"".

By default, OVS agent QoS minimum rules do not have a ""max-rate""
defined. Before this patch, any minimum bandwidth rule was
limiting the maximum rate to 100Mbit/s, that is the default value
set in ""tc ceil"". This patch provides the maximum ""max-rate"" value
for any minimum bandwidth rule.

For support raw kube-proxy we need to ensure the connectivity
between host node and pod. The patch propose a node handler, by the
node handler create and configure a neutron port for each host node.
Kuryr-daemon will plug a tap device related to the neutron port in
each host node. By the tab device the neutron node and the pod can
access each other.

We have been performing some tests using the Ubuntu Jammy image.
While doing such tests, we realized that the newest image would
need more RAM to be spawned successfuly, and that brings the need
to bump the memory for such VMs. While testing with the memory
bump, we realized that the generic driver would face issues with
such change.

We have seen a couple of tests failing due to the share manager
service loosing connection to the database, and this is usually
caused when we have a lack or high consumiption of resources in
a VM. Reducing the concurrency itself should work, and then
we would have the jobs passing. However, in reducing the
concurrency, this job will take longer to run, considering it
will only use one of the available threads, and it can lead to
this job's possibility to hit the 3 hours pre-scheduled limit.

To avoid that, we decided to:

Have this change to reduce the concurrency of the manila generic
driver job to 1, so we can avoid these failures, as well as
split the generic driver job into two jobs:

- manila-tempest-plugin-generic
- manila-tempest-plugin-generic-scenario

The generic one will take care of the API testing as we currently
know and have been doing. The scenario one will run all of the
scenario tests.

OVS translates the QoS and associated queue registers,
attached to a port, into ""tc"" linux-htb classfull traffic
shaper, applied on the port.

OVS creates a ""tc"" root class on the port device. On top of
this root class, the queues are represented as child ""tc""
classes. In order to define a ""min-rate"" value (""tc rate""),
a ""max-rate"" value (""tc ceil"") must be provided and higher than
""min-rate"".

By default, OVS agent QoS minimum rules do not have a ""max-rate""
defined. Before this patch, any minimum bandwidth rule was
limiting the maximum rate to 100Mbit/s, that is the default value
set in ""tc ceil"". This patch provides the maximum ""max-rate"" value
for any minimum bandwidth rule.

Reduces the deletion time of conjunction flows on hypervisors
where virtual machines reside which are part of a security
group that has remote security groups as target which contain
thousands of ports.

Without deferred deletion the agent will call ovs-ofctl several
hundred times in succession, during this time the agent will
block any new vm creation or neutron port modifications on this
hypervisor.

This patch has been tested using a single network with a single
vm with a security group that points to a remote security group
with 2000 ports.

During testing without the patch, the iteration time for deletion
was at around 500 seconds. After adding the patch to the l2 agent
on the test environment the same deletion time went down to
4 seconds.

The main purpose of Neutron's validation of the binding profile
is to make sure expected keys are present and that their values
are of the expected type.

The Nova compute component updates the binding profile as part of
instance creation.  Depending on the version of the Nova compute
component and which hardware it interfaces with, the information
provided by Nova in the binding profile may differ.

Nova also has limited information at its disposal at the point in
time it updates the port binding profile, so it would be
non-trivial for it to provide information conditionally based on
things like VNIC_TYPE and existing binding profile data.

Make the Neutron binding profile validation more robust for both
upgrade and heterogeneous hardware scenarios by accepting the
presence of surplus keys in the binding profile.  The data that
Neutron expects will still be validated and any surplus keys will
be pruned before further processing internally in Neutron.

This is a follow-up of [1]. Before this patch, any virtual logical
switch port that was updated and the ""device_owner"" was not and empty

This maintenance task, that is executed only once, lists all logical
switch ports, checks the presence or not of virtual parents and
sets the type to ""virtual"" if needed.

RPM setuptools to a version available in baseos repos.

Removes multipath base devices from consideration by
default, and instead allows the device-mapper device
managed by multipath to be picked up and utilized
instead.

In effect, allowing us to ignore standby paths *and*
leverage multiple concurrent IO paths if so offered
via ALUA.

In reality, anyone who has previously built IPA with
multipath tooling might not have encountered issues
previously because they used Active/Active SAN storage
environments. They would have worked because the IO lock
would have been exchanged between controllers and paths.
However, Active/Passive environments will block passive
paths from access, ultimately preventing new locks from
being established without proper negotiation. Ultimately
requiring multipathing *and* the agent to be smart enough
to know to disqualify underlying paths to backend storage
volumes.

An additional benefit of this is active/active MPIO devices
will, as long as ``multipath`` is present inside the ramdisk,
no longer possibly result in duplicate IO wipes occuring
accross numerous devices.

Back in the Ussuri release, we changed the Bifrost kernel location to
use ipa.kernel instead of ipa.vmlinuz. While this works fine for newly
discovered nodes, any node added to Bifrost in Train or earlier will
have kept ipa.vmlinuz as its deploy kernel.

This can cause issues since upgrading Bifrost or building new deployment
images will update ipa.kernel, but not ipa.vmlinuz, resulting in nodes
booting with an old kernel and a new ramdisk.

Fix by adding a new rule updating the legacy kernel location and
documenting how to update node information.

This combines two commits in one

* Change aggregation method to mean

Commit 6061286c3133a4b85c4a72160960ecf6a82d02f8 handles
ignoring gnocchi api error when metric is not created.
However there are functional test failures when the
aggregation method is set to last for alarm type
gnocchi_aggregation_by_resources_threshold,

This fix changes the aggregration method to mean for
any create/update of alarm type
gnocchi_aggregation_by_resources_threshold.

* Update python testing as per zed cycle testing runtime

In Zed cycle, we have dropped the python 3.6/3.7[1] testing
and its support. Add release notes and update the python

Commit 6061286c3133a4b85c4a72160960ecf6a82d02f8 handles
ignoring gnocchi api error when metric is not created.
However there are functional test failures when the
aggregation method is set to last for alarm type
gnocchi_aggregation_by_resources_threshold,

This fix changes the aggregration method to mean for
any create/update of alarm type
gnocchi_aggregation_by_resources_threshold.

* calls to the non-existent in stable/train_start_compute() helper

* add self.api_major_version to be compatible with stable/train

* add self._image_ref_parameter and self._flavor_ref_parameter to the

* make the new test class inherit from the InstanceHelperMixin, as
  that's there the _wait_for_state_change() helper is in stable/train.

Apache2's default value for KeepAliveTimeout is 5 seconds, which is okay
for general web-page serving use cases. However, connections from a web
browser to Horizon application can be terminated unnecessarily during
multiple requests in a session due to the short KeepAliveTimeout.

Let's ease KeepAliveTimeout to 75 seconds, which is fairly standard for
services behind a reverse proxy since it's the default value of nginx.

OVS translates the QoS and associated queue registers,
attached to a port, into ""tc"" linux-htb classfull traffic
shaper, applied on the port.

OVS creates a ""tc"" root class on the port device. On top of
this root class, the queues are represented as child ""tc""
classes. In order to define a ""min-rate"" value (""tc rate""),
a ""max-rate"" value (""tc ceil"") must be provided and higher than
""min-rate"".

By default, OVS agent QoS minimum rules do not have a ""max-rate""
defined. Before this patch, any minimum bandwidth rule was
limiting the maximum rate to 100Mbit/s, that is the default value
set in ""tc ceil"". This patch provides the maximum ""max-rate"" value
for any minimum bandwidth rule.

cinderlib master is still Yoga development, but when zuul runs on a
master patch, zuul.branch is 'master', and this cascades throughout
the various jobs.  It's particularly evident for requirements, but
also affects cinder and os-brick (which are installed from source);
from what I can tell, an initial install is done to gather
dependencies, and this seems to be from master by default.  So
explicitly use override-checkout for requirements, cinder, and
os-brick on all jobs.

Why are we only noticing this now?  I think it hasn't been a problem
in the past because python 3.6 has been supported from Rocky through
Yoga, and is dropped from Zed, and hence running the cinderlib Yoga
development branch against master for other projects is encountering
some serious incompatibilities.  We probably should have been using
the stable branch in cinderlib's pre-release trailing phase all
along; it just hasn't mattered until now.

OVS translates the QoS and associated queue registers,
attached to a port, into ""tc"" linux-htb classfull traffic
shaper, applied on the port.

OVS creates a ""tc"" root class on the port device. On top of
this root class, the queues are represented as child ""tc""
classes. In order to define a ""min-rate"" value (""tc rate""),
a ""max-rate"" value (""tc ceil"") must be provided and higher than
""min-rate"".

By default, OVS agent QoS minimum rules do not have a ""max-rate""
defined. Before this patch, any minimum bandwidth rule was
limiting the maximum rate to 100Mbit/s, that is the default value
set in ""tc ceil"". This patch provides the maximum ""max-rate"" value
for any minimum bandwidth rule.

tempest is running on the same host as the controller, and should be
able to access the database directly. This ptch removes the tunnelling

While working on the RPM packaging for whitebox, a few things came to
light around how we manage our requirements:

* sshtunnel is always imported, but only used in TripleO
  undercloud/overcloud environments. To avoid having to pull it into
  RDO and depend on it in our RPM packaging, make its import
  conditional. In the future, it will go away when we transition to
  standalone mulitonode for our TripleO CI job(s).

* While we are still unable to list tempest and our oslo requirements
  in requirements.txt (see commit eb43bd9), we can at least have them
  as comments with an explanation. This will make it easier to
  determine our RPM dependencies.

* In a similar vein, list tempest and our oslo requirements in
  test-requirements.txt - they need to be there because in unit test
  environments we do not expect to have tempest pre-installed.

Previously, any server action that did not get explicitly passed a
microversion would default to 2.1. This was because the _action()
method did not determine what microversion to use with
_get_microversion_for(), but rather accepted a microversion argument
with a default value of None. Only a single caller actually used that
argument. This means that the vast majority of server actions was
actually performed at microversion 2.1. This patch makes _action() use
_get_microversion_for(), and drops the microversion argument entirely.

According to the Nova API reference [1], the only non-optional
parameter to the rebuild action is the imageRef. The current
rebuild_server() method signature mandates a name and an
admin_password, which are actually optional. In addition, there are
many other possible arguments to the server rebuild action which are
not possible with the current rebuild_server() method signature.

This patch adjusts the method signature to match the API, adds a
**kwargs argument to allow for arbitrary arguments, and adds a
functional test.

rebuild_server() in the shade layer (openstack/cloud/_compute.py) is
intentionally left untouched, and can be fixed in a followup.

Currently, neutron tunnel endpoints must be IPv4 addresses,
i.e. $HOST_IP, although IPv6 endpoints are supported by most
drivers.

Create a TUNNEL_IP_VERSION variable to choose which host IP
to use, either HOST_IP or HOST_IPV6, and configure it in the
OVS and Linuxbridge agent driver files. The default is still
IPv4, but it can be over-ridden by specifying TUNNEL_ENDPOINT_IP
accordingly.

This behaves similar to the SERVICE_IP_VERSION option, which
can either be set to 4 or 6, but not 4+6 - the tunnel overhead
should be consistent on all systems in order not to have MTU

Must set the ML2 overlay_ip_version config option to match
else agent tunnel sync RPC will not work.

This patch keep the previous Ansible 'template' task for ansible, ceph,

This avoid creating a logrotate file strictly identical to other ones

This API compares a given CPU description with the CPU capabilities the
host hypervisor is able to provide.  It is more ""hypervisor-literate""
than its older counterpart, compareCPU().

The new API takes into account what the ""host hypervisor"" (meaning: KVM,
QEMU, and what libvirt knows about the host) is capable of.  Taking
advantage of these newer APIs will allow Nova to make more well-informed
decisions when determining CPU models that are compatible across
different hosts.  Details in[1].

    - - -

Example real-world problem: The older compareCPU() API uses host
physical CPUID -- it has CPU features that KVM itself doesn't expose.
However, there are also some CPU features that KVM can emulate, but are
not present in the host CPUID.  This causes live migration failures on
certain hardware, due to CPU incompatibility.

This problem can be solved by either (a) Nova not calling the older
compareCPU() at all; or (b) using the newer API, compareHypervisorCPU(),
which reflects the CPUID that KVM it actually able to expose to the
guest.  Option-(a) is not sensible because it results in aborting live
migration on the first unsupported host.  Option-(b) is the only
sensible path forward.

    - - -

From the ""Problem description"" in the spec[1]:

    The current guest CPU config libvirt APIs that Nova uses,
    compareCPU() and baselineCPU(), are ""not very useful"" [...] because
    they don't consider the capabilities of the ""host hypervisor"" (KVM,
    QEMU and details libvirt knows about the host).  More concretely,
    with the existing APIs, compareCPU() and baselineCPU(), there is no
    way to ask if a given CPU model plus CPU flags combination is
    supported by KVM and a specific QEMU binary on the host. [...]

Removes multipath base devices from consideration by
default, and instead allows the device-mapper device
managed by multipath to be picked up and utilized
instead.

In effect, allowing us to ignore standby paths *and*
leverage multiple concurrent IO paths if so offered
via ALUA.

In reality, anyone who has previously built IPA with
multipath tooling might not have encountered issues
previously because they used Active/Active SAN storage
environments. They would have worked because the IO lock
would have been exchanged between controllers and paths.
However, Active/Passive environments will block passive
paths from access, ultimately preventing new locks from
being established without proper negotiation. Ultimately
requiring multipathing *and* the agent to be smart enough
to know to disqualify underlying paths to backend storage
volumes.

An additional benefit of this is active/active MPIO devices
will, as long as ``multipath`` is present inside the ramdisk,
no longer possibly result in duplicate IO wipes occuring
accross numerous devices.

Reduces the deletion time of conjunction flows on hypervisors
where virtual machines reside which are part of a security
group that has remote security groups as target which contain
thousands of ports.

Without deferred deletion the agent will call ovs-ofctl several
hundred times in succession, during this time the agent will
block any new vm creation or neutron port modifications on this
hypervisor.

This patch has been tested using a single network with a single
vm with a security group that points to a remote security group
with 2000 ports.

During testing without the patch, the iteration time for deletion
was at around 500 seconds. After adding the patch to the l2 agent
on the test environment the same deletion time went down to
4 seconds.

Grenade jobs stop services, check fip connectivity
for a nova server and then upgrade to next release.

But since ovn data plane and db services are stopped along
with other services, fip connectivity fails as a result.

We shouldn't stop these services along with other
neutron services. This patch adds a new variable
""SKIP_STOP_OVN"" which can be used by grenade jobs
to skip stop of ovn services.

This will also fix the ovn grenade jobs.

Also source fixup_stuff.sh so function fixup_ovn_centos
is available. It's already sourced in stack.sh but
that's not used in grenade run.

The loader path values in SUSHY_EMULATOR_BOOT_LOADER_MAP can now
optionally contain a list of filenames instead of a single string
filename. When switching secure boot mode, the first path is the
non-secure boot loader, and the second is the secure boot loader.
SUSHY_EMULATOR_BOOT_LOADER_MAP values can still be a string or None.

Just like the boot mode behaviour, getting the secure boot status
works with both the old manual and new automatic formats. Also setting
the secure boot status will also upgrade existing old manual XML to
the automatic format.

In previous patch [1] I wrongly assumed that there's no reason to have
/etc/swift/ring_build_files/
on all hosts. However, there's another logic in the role, that assumes
having these files and verifying md5sum of them.

As an easy bugfix, we're returning sync to ring_build_files until we
change logic. It's also easily backportable.

In order to migrate to use of PKI role for Octavia,
we need to feed already existing certificates to the PKI role. For that
we're creating an overrides file, that will define already existing
certificates like they are user-provided ones.

When we want to purge all deleted rows
we use ""glance-manage db purge"" or
""glance-manage purge_images_table""
then we never know how many deleted rows are still in a table.
So we need to launch the command many times until
the command reports that 0 rows were deleted in every table.
It's inconvenient.
The patch introduced new valid value for ""max_rows"".
If ""max_rows"" equals -1 all deleted rows are purged.

Currently heat-dashboard is failing to build with dependency issues
on the Yoga release and the repo has been taking quite some time
to resolve this.

This change removes the inclusion of heat-dashboard from the default
image building for horizon and requirements, opting to include it
in the specific releases instead.
