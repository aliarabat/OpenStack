This commit introduces ref(templateName [, parameterName] [, idOnly])
YAQL function was added to UI definition DSL. This function evaluates
template templateName and fixes the result in parameters under
parameterName key (or templateName if the second parameter was omitted).
Then it generates object ID and places it into ?/id field. On the first
use of parameterName or if idOnly is false the function will return
the whole object structure. On subsequent calls or if idOnly is true it
will return the ID that was generated upon the first call.
Thus the function brings ability to reference single object several
times.

ID generation is done in a safe way with a special temporary type that
wraps string ID and replaced with string representation upon
serialization. This way it is still impossible for a developer to
explicitly provide ID value in the template (it is still going to be
overwritten because it is not of an ObjectID type and it is impossible
to create instance of ObjectID from yaql expression)

This is a hackish way to ensure that keepalived is restarted during the

It basically adds a comment line to the keepalived.conf file (making it
different than the puppet one) if it's there. This will force a puppet
restart of the keepalive service puting the ips back on the undercloud.

Currently when tripleo runs, puppet output is captured and printed
to the log in a batch at the end of the puppet run. This means
all timestamps are gone, which can make debugging more difficult
as it is not clear which resources are handled at which time,
particularly across multiple nodes.

This is addressed by logging to both the console and syslog directly.
While this will result in duplicate log entries as both the batched
and individual lines end up in syslog, it preseves the current
behavior that allows heat to output the puppet output, as well as
providing the output to the logging system.

As part of the first community-wide goal [1], teams were asked
to remove the openstack/common package of their projects
if one existed. This was a byproduct of the old oslo-incubator
form of syncing common functionality.

- Most of the apiclient package was not actually used in code,
  only the exceptions were. So remove most of it.
- Copy the exceptions from apiclient to an existing top level
  location.
- Create an i18n module to remove the gettextutils dependency,
  this creates a new requirement - oslo.i18n.
- Remove a test (test_base) since it was testing the
  functionality of apiclient.base, which was not used in
  congressclient.
- General cleanup to other openstack/common references

Due to the way caching is disabled the SHOULD_CACHE_FN() is used
to determine if new values are stored in the cache backend, and is
only called when the regeneration is required. If dogpile is
configured to connect to a memcache, redis, etc to store data
it is possible with caching disabled to still pull values from
the cache (SHOULD_CACHE_FN has no bearing on reads).

The issue described only impacts the use of the memoization
decorator.

This change forces dogpile to use the null backend if caching is
globally disabled to ensure no data is read from the external
cache. This will not affect subsystem disabling of cache.

Even with cache disabled but reads coming from the external cache,
there stale data is not a concern as invalidates will still be
processed and the data from the backend will eventually timeout
in most cases.

When we make a keystoneauth Session instance we are not looking at domain
info. This way we're always creating v2Password auth plugin, which will
obviously fail in an Identity v3-only scenario.

This patch makes domain information (i.e user_domain_id and project_domain_id)
be read from the context so that we can issue v3Password plugin as well.

Also, the logic behind auth plugin creation has been changed, as long as the
loading mechanism is designed to read options from config files, which is not
the case. Creating the plugin directly seems to fit better here.

This change is backwards compatible, since identity.Password can figure
out what Identity version is in use and will ignore domain info if v2.0

So ovs-native jobs are unnecessary in master.
But a test case which doesn't use default as ovs-interface(vsctl and ovs-ofctl)
still needs to be checked.
This allows to run the test case with non-default ovs-interface on all

Solves a bug that can brake the periodic task execution in
oneview drivers. The problem occurs when the method to check
if a node is in use by oneview raise an exception.

When that happens, the periodic task will break its execution,
leaving the node with a wrong provision state and wrong
maintenance mode too. The expected behavior when this occurs
is skip processing the current node, iterate over the next
node and process it.

This patch changes the periodic task execution flow, ignoring
the exception and processing the next node. In the next
periodic task execution, the not processed node can be
processed and updated accordingly.

and also removes handling of 'ipa-driver-name' kernel parameter,
as it was only used in code related to old passthru.

To be able to support multiple hosts working with the same resources we
have added the workers table to keep track of which host is working with
each specific resource.

This patch makes c-vol service work with this new table by adding
entries on cleanable operations and removing them once these operations
have completed.

Service cleanup on initialization has also been changed to use this new
table so hosts will cleanup only resources from operations they left on
the air and leave any operations that are being processed by other
hosts.

So maybe we use {'name': 'action_name_%s' % target.name} better.
Although the target.name can be non-unique it also can provie more

And some unit tests error use name as id to do test such as

In order to facilitate a future extraction of the placement service
we want to record the association between a resource provider and an
arbitrary aggregate uuid in its own table.

A PlacementAggregate model is joined from ResourceProvider via
ResourceProviderAggregate. Note that this structure is used so we can
join on ids instead of strings (the uuids). A direct mapping between
ResourceProvider uuid and Aggregate uuid was mooted earlier in the year
but was determined to be suboptimal.

The name 'placement_aggregates' is used as the least problematic of
several choices after discussion amongst several parties.

The data will be used by the forthcoming get_ and set_aggregates
methods on the ResourceProvider object.

We rely on keepalived to send gratuitous ARPs when floating IP is added.
Older versions of keepalived up to 1.2.20 (exclusive) contain bug [1] where
keepalived does not send GARP on receiving SIGHUP. Unfortunately, newer
versions containing the fix are not packaged yet for some distributions
like RHEL or CentOS or Ubuntu Xenial, so this patch adds a workaround for
such distributions until new packages are available.

The patch also sets net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind kernel parameter to 0 for
Snat and HA router namespaces in order to avoid sending gratuitous ARPs
for IP addresses that are not bound to the interface anymore - possibly
because of failover or removal. Note that kernel < 3.19 contain a bug
where this knob is missing. In case it attempts to set the parameter and
it's missing on the system, it doesn't set the knob in root
namespace like it's done for fip namespaces, but only issues a warning
message.

Reasons for the current (short) token lifespan:

- (Performance) A short token lifespan reduces the number of
  simultaneously-valid UUID, PKI, and PKIZ tokens in the database (or in
  memcached). This is not an issue for Fernet tokens, which are not
  persisted, anyway.

- (Security) We used to not be great about hiding bearer tokens from
  logs, HTTP requests, etc. We've gotten better, to say the least.

Problems with the current (short) token lifespan:

- (Use case) They break long-running processes when the token expires
  before the process completes. Alternative solutions to addressing this
  use case without increasing the expiration are complicated.

- (Performance) Users have to re-authenticate more frequently.

Drawbacks to increasing the token lifespan:

- (Security) Increased exposure for compromised bearer tokens.

Upcoming changes will add new methods to the identity drivers, so
in preparation for that we create a new versioned driver.

In order to allow the use of a legacy driver, one of the unit tests
had to be changed. Further, in order to maintain distinct models
for Identity, the copy of the sql driver for legacy testing required
all the classes/tables names to be given the V8 suffix.

Limitations:

The Shadow user driver interface loads and makes calls to the base
identity drivers. Currently this cannot load the legacy version,
meaning that the federated shadow users driver methods are not
tested against the legacy driver.

1. Move parse_docker_image() to zun/common/utils.py
It has been renamed to parse_image_tag() as its in common location
and not specific to docker only

2. Allows image_pull() to take repo and tag as separate arguements.
This is done because in case if image driver is glance then it gives
an error when repo contains tag name

NOTE1: This patch does not validate repo names. Thats out of scope
of this patch and will be handled in separate patch

NOTE2: As of now metadata of glance driver is not stored anywhere so
glance driver takes tag as argument but do not really uses it

We were using parameters for scaling down but parameter_defaults for
scaling up. The old parameters from scale-down still persisted in the
stack and took precedence over the scaled-up parameter_defaults, so the
scaled-up values didn't propagate.

We already update parameter_defaults in the deployment plan in that same
method, so all we need to do is remove the 'parameters' part.

Our current volume_update method reads the volume from the DB, joining
the volume table with 4 or 5 other tables, and then do the update using
SQLAlchemy ORM engine before returning updated ORM object.

But the truth is that we don't really need to retrieve the volume again
in any of existing cases, since the caller either doesn't care about
current value in the DB -for example when setting status to error- or it
already has that information -composing it with the current value it has
and the updated fields it's passing- and doesn't need to reload it.

This additional joined read from the DB on every volume update is
creating unnecessary load on the DB and reducing our network capacity
and in other resources we are not retrieving it either.

This patch modifies the way we do updates so we don't read current DB
values.

We are noticing several tests failing in our low memory environment
because of timeout in neutron requests.
As an example the test
tempest.api.compute.servers.test_server_actions.ServerActionsTestJSON
fails because it requests to plug a vif, and send request to neutron,
which responds in more than neutron_url_timeout, and since the option
vif_plugging_is_fatal is set to True as default, the test fails.
Shortly thereafter, checking in neutron log you can see the request,
returning with the proper status, after more than neutron_url_timeout,
however, it's already too late once nova already marked the instance
with error status, and so the test fails.

We were using parameters for scaling down but parameter_defaults for
scaling up. The old parameters from scale-down still persisted in the
stack and took precedence over the scaled-up parameter_defaults, so the
scaled-up values didn't propagate.

We already update parameter_defaults in the deployment plan in that same
method, so all we need to do is remove the 'parameters' part.

This patch refactors all logic and models that are abstract in SFC, and
not specific to the OVS driver, moving them out of the OVS driver.
It also updates the OVS driver so that it only manages OVS-specific
resources and not the abstract plugin resources.

This allows Service Function Path IDs and identifiers to be managed and
generated in the networking-sfc plugin itself, instead of inside the
OVS driver, so that any driver can reuse these SFP allocations.

[WIP]
This is a work-in-progress and is missing the following at this time:
- Updated tests;
- A working Update Port Chain - the plugin/driver interface is not
  ideal to carry out the update of an existing port chain, due to the
  split into abstract plugin resources and specific [OVS] resources.
  As such, more discussion with the team should be held to decide the
  best way to approach this, potentially by modifying the plugin/driver
  interface;
- Hands-on validation of instantiating more than 1 port-chain;
- Potentially change migration path - and discuss implications
  of it since a lot of tables are being changed subtractively;
- Other planned code changes.

During post live migration the XML defined in libvirt does not contain
the definition of serial ports. That is because we call the method
get_guest_config_xml to retrieve the XML definition which is not going
to return a definition of serial ports because the instance already
define them. Actually calling this method to retrieve domain XML of an
instance is not good in every cases because the aim of that method is
to define a domain XML not to return a domain XML, for that purpose we
prefer to call XMLDesc(0).

Also that commit is removing the process to write into a file the
domain XML which is not used anymore. libvirtd is storing the XML
definition of domains by itself (see: guest.write_instance_config())

When performing an obj_clone on an Instance object, it relies on the
base obj_clone's deep copy method which just goes through all of the
fields and duplicates them on the clone.  However, the Instance object
has internal tracking attributes for metadata and system_metadata that
keep track of which keys have changed.  Since these don't get copied
over on the deep copy, these will show up as having changed on the
cloned Instance (if they had metadata set originally) and on a save
on this cloned object will end up updating the metadata in the db
which if these have stale information will wipe out other changes.

Such a scenario to this is occurring during build_instance where the
Claim constructor is saving off a clone of the Instance object
so that it will have the current copy.  In the case of a failure
during the build_instance, the claim will use this current copy
to then set the value of the host on the instance to None.  Since
the clone reflects that the system_metadata has changed, it will
as part of the save try to update the system_metadata in the db,
which since it is stale will wipe out changes made.

In the case of the issue being fixed here, the value in the
system_metdata being wiped out is the network_allocated=True
attribute.  By this being wiped out then reschedules of that
build_instance fail in cases where the IP address has been

Specifying a PF passthrough device in the pci_passthrough_whitelist using its
fully qualified PCI address (no wildcard) causes the device to not be
properly loaded.  The PCI device is then not available to be assigned to any
guest.

In this case, the hypervisor reports the PF device without a 'parent_addr'.
But in the PciAddress, match() is using it when doing the comparison to its
own address.

This commit changes the logic of the address matching method in PciDevSpec to
only try to match the address with a physical function device when a
'parent_addr' is reported by the hypervisor.

The warning message for rsync tempfiles was removed in the related

positive maybe it's still useful to log a debug message.  Instead of
silently ignoring rsync tempfiles, when running in debug we note the

I also consolidate our use of the regex for rsync tempfiles into the
diskfile module and move the negative test for the warning logger
message a little next to the positive test.

 - If NeutronExternalNetworkBridge is an emptry string '' Json was
   dropping the single quotes thus causing the bridge to get set

The very specific 'password' is being masked when logging
requests but not when logging response bodies.

This change fixes the response logging to mask passwords and
also makes the request logging more robust as it was just
checking for 'password' but the mask_password method handles
much more than that.

We are noticing several tests failing in our low memory environment
because of timeout in neutron requests.
As an example the test
tempest.api.compute.servers.test_server_actions.ServerActionsTestJSON
fails because it requests to plug a vif, and send request to neutron,
which responds in more than neutron_url_timeout, and since the option
vif_plugging_is_fatal is set to True as default, the test fails.
Shortly thereafter, checking in neutron log you can see the request,
returning with the proper status, after more than neutron_url_timeout,
however, it's already too late once nova already marked the instance
with error status, and so the test fails.

This patch updates the Yaql expressions that work on role_data
so that they evaluate properly when the get_attr for role_data
is null.

I hit issues using this for the heat undercloud installer and this
seems to resolve them.

If os-collect-config/config.json is updated before an upgrade/update,
then the os-net-config run will automatically erase the keepalived
managed ips.

This is a hackish way to ensure that keepalived is restarted during the
next phase in order to have the ip recreated.

It basically adds a comment line to the keepalived.conf file (making it
different than the puppet one) if it's there. This will force a puppet
restart of the keepalive service puting the ips back on the undercloud.

Move abstract definitions of get_properties and validate to BaseInterface
and make all interfaces inherit it. This has a side effect of them getting
clean steps methods, but they anyway won't be wired in due to a whitelist
of interfaces in the conductor.

The RAIDInterface contained a mistake: it didn't have an ABCMeta metaclass,
so its @abstractmethod definitions didn't work. I've implemented get_properties
for it to avoid breaking implementers.

Also added interface_type to all interfaces for consistency and for future
use in the driver composition work.

Allow cinder-volume, nova-compute and nova-libvirtd to be configured to
use NFS. In order to mount and work with NFS shares, several containers
needed the NFS packages installed during build time.

One somewhat significant change is the addition of an explicit bind
volume for nova-compute that has shared mounts enabled.

According to docker-run(1), the shared mount propagation flag can only
be specified for bind mounted Docker volumes and not named volumes.

In an NFS setup, cinder-volume mounts the NFS shares so that it can
create and manage the Cinder volumes. When a new instance is created
with a Cinder volume or a Cinder volume is attached to an existing
instance, nova-compute mounts the Cinder volume from the NFS share for
nova-libvirtd. In order for nova-libvirtd to then see those Cinder
volumes the shared mounts flag must be enabled for the Docker volume.

Remove the rpcbind container as it is only necessary for operators who
are using NFSv3 or lower. There is no known need for this currently
however, this container can be added in the future should an operator
require it.

Some functional tests fail because they assert dictionaries
with date/time items. For example, test_environment_template_create
checks that dictionary env_template exists in env_template_list
dicrionary list. All mentioned dictionaries have date/time items
with keys 'Created' and 'Updated'. If the system, where functional
tests are executed will be quite slow - time in these dictionaries
could differ. This behavior will result corresponding test to fail
even if all tasks will be executed successfully because time in
dictionaries for 'Created' and 'Updated' keys will differ and
assert will fail

Removing the date/time items from dictionaries will help to
successfully pass functional tests

Currently when we call the major-upgrade step we do the following:
""""""
...
if [[ -n $(is_bootstrap_node) ]]; then
    check_clean_cluster
fi
...
if [[ -n $(is_bootstrap_node) ]]; then
    migrate_full_to_ng_ha
fi
...
for service in $(services_to_migrate); do
    manage_systemd_service stop ""${service%%-clone}""
    ...
done
""""""

The problem with the above code is that it is open to the following race
condition:
1. Code gets run first on a non-bootstrap controller node so we start
stopping a bunch of services
2. Pacemaker notices will notice that services are down and will mark
the service as stopped
3. Code gets run on the bootstrap node (controller-0) and the
check_clean_cluster function will fail and exit
4. Eventually also the script on the non-bootstrap controller node will
timeout and exit because the cluster never shut down (it never actually
started the shutdown because we failed at 3)

Let's make sure we first only call the HA NG migration step as a
separate heat step. Only afterwards we start shutting down the systemd
services on all nodes.

We also need to move the STONITH_STATE variable into a file because it
is being used across two different scripts (1 and 2) and we need to
store that state.

We reference keystone_auth_uri, but this isn't actually written as a
hieradata key in controller.yaml.  Intead we need to reference a
per-service key which contains the data (as these are written in

this is enabling a neutron plugin.

Note this is a mitaka/liberty only fix because we fixed this already during
the refactoring of neutron-opencontrail.yaml into the composable services

When the CLI makes subsequent deployments it manually updates the plan
in Mistral. We need to do this for backwards compatibility as the deploy
command previously didn't have any plans or history behind it. So if a
user deploys with a specific parameter or template and then they remove
it in the next deploy it shouldn't still exist. In short, the CLI
expects everything to be passed to the deploy command every time.
Therefore, the easiest way to handle this is by manually resetting the
plan.

This has mostly been the case, but we neglected to reset the
parameter_defaults. Meaning, that a user may deploy with a parameter
like ""ComputeScale: 5"" and then deploy again, without defining it and it
would use the previous value when they would expect it to use the
default.

When selecting environments to deploy from the UI, every environment
filename gets added individually to 'environments' key in the Mistral
environment. Apparently it means we hit the Mistral execution size
limit pretty quickly.

This isn't needed for the CLI at this point because it bunches all the
environment files together into one big ""user-environments.yaml"" file,
for backwards-compabitility reasons.

Note that this Mistral value seems to affect both input and output for
task execution, which is why this patch was initially created as a
prerequisite for Ia9d2312e942229b659cfc65d4c370874e87f44da.

split out l3-ha specific test from TestMl2PortsV2

split out test_update_port_status_notify_port_event_after_update
from ml2.test_plugin.TestMl2PortsV2 into TestMl2PortsV2WithL3

The change set of 25f5912cf8f69f18d111bd60a6cc6ee488755ff3
change id of Iedad1ccae45005efaaa74d5571df04197757d07a
introduced a test,
test_update_port_status_notify_port_event_after_update, that is valid
only when l3 plugin support l3-ha. Such assumption isn't always true
depending on actual ml2 driver.
Since test cases in ml2.test_plugin is used as a common base for
multiple drivers,
test_update_port_status_notify_port_event_after_update, may or may not
pass. So split out tests with very specific assumption into a new
dedicated testcase so that each driver can safely reuse tests in
tests/unit/plugin/ml2 based on their characteristics.
