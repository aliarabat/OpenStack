This patch refactors the ceph_client role to add support for multiple
operating system distros and multiple sources for Ceph packages.

The support of multiple sources for the Ceph packages  is important
to organizations that must get packages from Canonical for service and
support. The current Ceph repo setup goes to upstream ceph.com
repositories and does not work with the UCA.

The use of UCA is also important when running OpenStack on the ppc64le
architecture because ceph.com does not have Debian packages available
for this architecture and the default trusty and trusty-updates repos
only have Ceph Giant, whereas the user can get later releases such as
Ceph Jewel from UCA.

The multiple operating system support for Trusty and Xenial also plays
into this since Xenial has Ceph Jewel by default.  For Xenial OSA
deployments users may want to use the modern ceph client already
available for the distro.

The choice of which Ceph source to use is simple for deployers. They
simply set it with the ceph_pkg_source variable but have additional
variables they can tweak to pick specific Ceph versions from the
sources:

The ceph_pkg_source variable controls the install source for the
Ceph packages.
Valid values include:
  * ceph This option installs Ceph from a ceph.com repo.  Additional
         variables to adjust items such as Ceph release and regional
         download mirror can be found in vars/*.yml

  * uca  This option installs Ceph from the Ubuntu Cloud Archive.
         Additional variables to adjust items such as the
         OpenStack/Ceph release can be found in vars/*.yml.

  * distro This options installs Ceph from the operating system's
           default repository and unlike the other options does not
           attempt to manage package keys or add additional package
           repositories.

The password for this 'clustercheck' user is randomly generated

- Step 1 -> Install all the basic galera packages and basic
  configuration
- Step 2.a -> Create /etc/sysconfig/clustercheck with root and empty
  password
- Step 2.b -> Start up galera-monitor xinetd service
- Step 2.c -> Start pacemaker ocf resource (no root user has been
  created
  so there will be an empty password per default)
- Step 2.d -> Wait for /bin/clustercheck to return success and then
  proceed with the other steps

After this change the workflow is slightly more complex because there
is a bit of a chicken and egg problem:
- Step 1 -> Install all the basic galera packages and basic
  configuration
- Step 2.a -> Create /etc/sysconfig/clustercheck with root and empty
  password unless the file does exists already and has a clustercheck
user
  configured
- Step 2.b -> Start up galera-monitor xinetd service
- Step 2.c -> Start pacemaker ocf resource (no root user has been

  yet, so there will be an empty password per default)
- Step 2.d -> Wait for /bin/clustercheck to return success and then
  proceed
  with the other steps
- Step 2.e -> Create clustercheck db user
- Step 3 -> Create /etc/sysconfig/clustercheck with clustercheck user
  credentials
- Step 4.a -> Update the sql root password on the each node (at this
  stage
- Step 4.b -> Create /root/.my.cnf with proper credentials on all nodes

Note that we cannot really create the root/clustercheck users right at
step 1 because the db is not running yet (an approach that spawned
mysqld on each node, created the users and shut it down, was tried but
was much more complex and cannot work on updating existing setups)

Given the new way of solving the root password issue, we also need to
make sure that Step1 and Step2 are running on updates.

Notes:
There was one rebasing conflict because in liberty step 5 does not
exist. So the last operations (sql root password update and
/root/.my.cnf creation) are done at step 4 in order to not create
another step.

Removing the router from dvr_snat node removes the qrouters
that are servicing the VM and dhcp ports.

If there are still dvr serviceable ports in the dvr_snat node,
and if router remove command is executed to remove the router
association from the dvr_snat agent then only the snat
functionality should be moved to the the different agent
and the router namespaces should be untouched.

This patch checks if there are any dvr serviceable ports for
the dvr router and if exists, it will not send a router_remove
message to the agent, but instead will send an router_update
message to the agent.

Ansible Bug: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/15929

When ansible 1.9 copy with delegate_to inventory_hostname, the check
for the presence of the source file to copy (the one delegated to
the remote node) is done on the deploy node.
This works fine when the files exist on the deploy node, but will fail
when the deploy node is different than remote node.

This rollbacks the ansible copy task to a command task to fix
the issue we're hitting.

The delegate_to function is unused when called with_first_found.
However in Ansible 2 using delegate_to and with_first_found forces
Ansible to login to the target host and search for files that are
nowhere to be found. this is an issue because Ansible 2 is more
strict on how tasks are executed.

This is step two to recover from Tempest failures. Fork is
deplorable, but this is a temporary fix until the extension
framework for L3 is put in place.

The fix is predicated on the fact that we can get to override
the l3 agent entry point reliably; alternatively the Tempest
job must explicitly call a 'new' forked L3 agent as stop-gap.

When agent starts up, it checks whether patch ports exists
before adding them. But the routine used to query the
patch port's existence is get_port_ofport() which retries
the opertation because of the @_ofport_retry decoration.
This creates an unwanted delay in the startup of the
agent, when the port do not exist.
The port's existence can be checked with port_exists()
call on the bridge with no retries.

This patch brings over neutron.common.rpc as part of
our base agent effort [1]. In order to remove the dependency
on neutron.common.exceptions:
(a) ALLOWED_EXMODS is updated to only include the
neutron-lib exceptions by default.
(b) rpc.init() is updated to accept an extra_extmods kwarg
allowing consumers to pass in additional extmods. If extra
extmods are passed, init() adds them using
add_extra_exmods().
Consumers of neutron-lib.rpc.init() will need to be updated
to pass in neutron exceptions for extmods where appropriate
once merged into neutron-lib.

Additionally the test_rpc unit tests from neutron are brought
over. Finally a new unit test method is added to verify the
behavior of init() as described above W/R/T passing
extra_extmods.

This fix does proper generation of dependencies for pre-task-based
deployment tasks. It checks if a deployment task is in pre-/post-
or main deployment graph and assigns dependencies properly without
creating dependencies loops.

Example:

taskA: requires: post-deployment-start, groups:B

w/o this fix it would create the following loop:

taskA->B_end->post-deployment-start->taskA

This fix adds a new override `memcached_connections` which is
automatically calculated from the number of memcached
connection limit plus additional 1k to configure the OS nofile limit.
Without proper nofile limit configuration, memcached will crash
in order to support higher parallel connection TCP/Memcache counts.

Adding this flag to specified disk allows user to choose bootable disk
from Fuel UI and CLi.

This change is very important for deployments with multipath connected
block devices. Mainly, it is because, order of disks in UI can change
easly in this case, so we need introduce to user a possibility to
choose bootable disk explicitly.

Currently, Manila UI adds its own HTML template to project/overview
page for quota limits. It contains info for other projects.
It is fragile and redundant.

Therefore, delete that template, reusing original Horizon's one that
is flexible enough to display limits for any project.

Extend one of Horizon's view python-classes with Manila data that
will be picked up by HTML template. It is safe to do the same for
other Horizon plugins too.

If PATCHING_CI=1, then:

1) Build iso with BUILD_PACKAGES=0:
   late packages (fuel-bootstrap-image, fuel-docker-images)
   should be always build since they are depend on the first
   level artifacts (packages);
2) Make sure the release version of bootstrap and
   docker packages is increasing.
    We need to be sure that packages (in packages-late target):
     - fuel-bootstrap-image
     - fuel-docker-images
    will increase their release numbers by 1 continuously
    in order to be able to ship them in updates repositories.

When a new subnet is added to a network, the network cache
is updated with the list of subnets regardless of which ones
have DHCP enabled. This changes the index order of the subnet
list which means that the tags used for each subnet change.

This means we must restart the process because the opts file
will be using different tags than the process args. This patch
implements that change. It also sorts the subnets on the RPC
side so the agent indexes don't change if subnets aren't
added/deleted.

The previous logic was only restarting the process when DHCP
enabled subnets changed, which meant that adding a DHCP disabled
subnet would break the association between the opts file tags and
the process arg tags, which led to the reported bug.

It should be possible to select some tasks and execute
only the selected tasks instead of all the tasks.
But the current behavior does not allow to execute only the
selected tasks. This is due to the fact that the variable
conataining the selected tasks is overridden to contain
all the tasks before the execution. That variable should be
overridden only if the initial value was None.
This commit will fix the issue.

This fix does proper generation of dependencies for pre-task-based
deployment tasks. It checks if a deployment task is in pre-/post-

creating dependencies loops.

Example:

taskA: requires: post-deployment-start, groups:B

w/o this fix it would create the following loop:

taskA->B_end->post-deployment-start->taskA

Currently ovs-ofctl command is executed for only default ofp version
(OpenFlow10).
Some Neutron's plugin uses OpenFlow13 and in that case ovs-ofctl fails.
This chage allows us to get ovs info for all ofp versions supported by ovs.
And adds dump by dump-ports and dump-ports-desc.

This change updates the require statements in the providers
to resolve the issues with the autoloader in puppet. This
issue technically always existed but was masked prior to the
split with puppet server and puppet agent because both used to
share the same loadpath. Documentation on this issue can be
read at https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4450.

 - The base framework supports the ability to roll out
   partial upgrades to agent nodes and have older agents
   work seamlessly with newer server nodes.
 - Neutron has online db schema migrations.
 - Neutron has CI testing (genade-multinode) to validate
   mixed deployments [1]

This strictly applies to the core neutron platform and more will have
to be added over time to refine this capability.

The problem is that if we use nova-network and multi host configuration, [1,2]
nova-network service can be not run yet. This is a problem because nova_network
provider uses nova client and then as nova-api just does an RPC call to
nova-network, which actually creates networks [3]. This impacts multinode
configurations with nova-network services running only on compute node.

causing the service to exit when fernet keys do not exist and this
role's functional testing to fail.

The 'Distribute the fernet key repository' task uses the
'ansible_ssh_host' variable from members of the 'keystone_all[1:]'
group. Since 'ansible_ssh_host' is set through group_vars based on the
current working host's 'ansible_host', it's not looked up correctly
within loops and fernet keys are only being synced within the same host.

Move 'ansible_ssh_host' from being dynamically assigned in group_vars to
being statically assigned within the inventory.

Heat is unable to execute the following join when creating the
os-net-config definition (OsNetConfigImpl):

	addresses:
	-
		ip_netmask:
		list_join:
		- '/'
		- - {get_param: ControlPlaneIp}
	          - {get_param: ControlPlaneSubnetCidr}

In the default network-environment.yaml environment file the
ControlPlaneSubnetCidr is defaulted as a non-string ""24"", e.g.

	ControlPlaneSubnetCidr: 24

Resulting in the following error, upon deploymnet:

2016-03-30 22:44:17 [overcloud-Controller-wazxxjc6dq22-2-2ictqfdx2nuo]:

This patch simply updates the default value to '24', to match other
templates. This allows a deployment to succeed as expected.

This patch aims to reduce the TinyIPA ramdisk file size by removing

The RADOS gateway on startup will try to initialize a number
of pools in the Ceph cluster; if no OSD's are present at the
point of startup, this operation is re-tried for a period of
5 minutes.

As ceph-radosgw and ceph-mon are typically deployed in LXC
containers, they are up and running before ceph-osd units
are fully operational, resulting in ceph-radosgw units with
no running radosgw process.

By deferring the provision of keys to related ceph-radosgw
units until ceph-osd units are detected, the chance of this
race happening is greatly reduced.

Also add trailing space to ceph.conf as ceph requires that
configuration files end with a newline.

As of the Ceph Jewel release, certain limitations apply to
OSD object name lengths: specifically if ext4 is in use for
block devices or a directory based OSD is configured, OSD's
must be configured to limit object name length:

  osd max object name len = 256
  osd max object namespace len = 64

the ceph-radosgw charm or for direct users of RADOS.

Set a password for the 'root' db user and add an additional
'clustercheck' user to be used only by the resource agent.
The password for this 'clustercheck' user is randomly generated
via a heat parameter.

Before this change the workflow to set up the database in the
manifest is the following:
- Step 1 -> Install all the basic galera packages and basic configuration
- Step 2.a -> Create /etc/sysconfig/clustercheck with root and empty password
- Step 2.b -> Start up galera-monitor xinetd service
- Step 2.c -> Start pacemaker ocf resource (no root user has been created
  so there will be an empty password per default)
- Step 2.d -> Wait for /bin/clustercheck to return success and then
  proceed with the other steps

After this change the workflow is slightly more complex because there
is a bit of a chicken and egg problem:
- Step 1 -> Install all the basic galera packages and basic configuration
- Step 2.a -> Create /etc/sysconfig/clustercheck with root and empty
  password unless the file does exists already and has a clustercheck user
  configured
- Step 2.b -> Start up galera-monitor xinetd service
- Step 2.c -> Start pacemaker ocf resource (no root user has been created
  yet, so there will be an empty password per default)
- Step 2.d -> Wait for /bin/clustercheck to return success and then proceed
  with the other steps
- Step 2.e -> Create clustercheck db user
- Step 3/4 -> Create /etc/sysconfig/clustercheck with clustercheck user credentials
- Step 5.a -> Update the sql root password on the each node (at this
  stage
- Step 5.b -> Create /root/.my.cnf with proper credentials on all nodes

Note that we cannot really create the root/clustercheck users right at
step 1 because the db is not running yet (an approach that spawned
mysqld on each node, created the users and shut it down, was tried but
was much more complex and cannot work on updating existing setups)

Given the new way of solving the root password issue, we also need to
make sure that Step1 and Step2 are running on updates.

This patch fixes an issue where template VLUNs are left
behind during a detach.  This can happen when a volume is
exported via multiple ports to support multipath and at
detach time one of those paths becomes inactive, bad nic,
pulled cable, etc.

The 3PAR inactive VLUNs are actually templates.  When you
delete a template VLUN, all active VLUNs associated with
that template are also removed.  This patch deletes
template VLUNs at detach time.

When the timeout is not given and heartbeats disabled, the socket will
turn blocking w/o a timeout set. This is dangerous as it may hang a

Instead, make the socket.settimeout() fallback to the TCP_USER_TIMEOUT,
which is always use a timeout mode for blocking sockets.

Consolidate undercloud-post-config and undercloud-stack-config into
undercloud-install element. All 3 of these elements have to be used
together anyway, so it makes sense to consolidate them all into one as
they're getting smaller. The consolidation will also make easier to
reason about what is remaining in the elements.

Manage the installation of os-net-config and openvswitch and the
execution of os-net-config via puppet instead of the bash element.

We do still generate the os-net-config configuration via os-apply-config
so, a template is added for that to the undercloud-install element.

As part of this switch, we lose some of the logic from
20-os-net-config[1], namely the configure_safe_defaults fallback
function for when os-net-config failes. However, in almost all cases
(possibly 100%), we never want this fallback on the undercloud anyway
because it will reconfigure the management interface to the undercloud,
which presumably is the interface that is already in use for out of band
management.

This change also requires a 2 step puppet apply, with the first step
running os-net-config.

""OpenStack Services"" and ""Servers"" in overview cannot be translated
properly, because these words are defined in the localsettings
which are the global variables and these variables are changed
directly.
So there is a possibility that this values can be changed when
two or more users access to the Horizon GUI.
This patch creates the deep copy for changing the values in the
localsettings, and can avoid the affect from the other user

This function will be helpful in DR scenario for
production & disaster recovery sites which are two
independent OpenStack cloud. Cloud admin and DR manage
system could get driver-specific reference to replica
volume after creating replicated volumes in production
site, and then manage replica volumes in DR site for
failover purpose when disaster happens.

Changes:
1. Only allow admin to query rep_target_id.
   This information should only be known by admin users.
2. improve some doc bugs in replication.

In order to know if a certain functionality is
supported throught storlets, it is not enough
to know if the storlet_handler exists in the
pipeline (which is what currently covered by info)
but we also need the ability to know which storlets
are installed. Thus, we want to export the name
of the container holding the storlets.

It might be that gateways other then the current one
would store the storlets in a different manner, thus
we also export the class name of the gateway implementation

A usage of this is the spark use case, where we test
if the relevant storlet exists in order to decide whether
to activate the pushdown or not

This involves adding a new test and somewhat refactoring
the config parser.

Bonus: Fixing the ant deploy_host_engine and deploy_container_engine
that got broke with recent installation refactoring

Currently when disable_fallocate is true it disables calling the
fallocate syscall, but it doesn't disable fallocate_reserve. This
patch fixes this.

This problem has caused functional tests to fail in our SAIOs, since
SAIOs have disable_fallocate set but the fallocate_reserve space free
checking was still being run creating 507 responses. This is thanks
to the change in fallocate_reserve default changing from 0 to 1%.

Because fallocate_reserve and disable_fallocate causes SAIO functional
tests to fail a section called 'Known Issues' has been added to the
SAIO developer documentation which includes a warning about
using fallocate_reserve on SAIOs.

This is follow up for https://review.openstack.org/#/c/283351/.

Probe fix:
- The probe in the patch now fails (sometimes success luckily)
  because inbound X-Timestamp is deprecated at the change,
  f581fccf71034818d19062593eeb52a4347bb174, so we can not use
  X-Timestamp to make an object with arbitrary timestamp anymore
  from outside of Swift. This patch makes the probe to use internal
  client to put the objects to make the inconsistent situation.

Small things:

- Enable expirer split brain test even if we have just one policy.
- FAIL rather than ERROR if the object was expired incorrectly
- ObjectBrainSplitter now uses the policy set at instance variable in
  default instead of random choice of ENABLED_POLICIES.

Some third party CI systems leave PUBLIC_INTERFACE as the default,
but do not actually create the device. ip would set errno to 1 when
this happens[1], and that's fine - however arping would exit with errno
set to 2, which triggers the exit_trap and stops stacking.[2]

Test whether disabling connection pooling helps to resolve the
replication scenario test failure*.

The theory is that detaching the replica may terminate open
connections held by the test client causing the subsequent
check to fail.

There is probably no benefit in pooling test connections
anyways and this should enesure every test always gets a fresh one.

Added code to devstack libraries to allow KMIP secret store to be
enabled. This edits barbican.conf to enable the KMIP secret store.

The Barbican PyKMIP client can be configured to connect to an existing
KMIP device or use PyKMIP's server. If the client configuration is all
that is needed then enable the 'barbican-pykmip' service in the
devstack configuration and set the appropriate key, certificate, and
CA path variables. This will allow the Barbican KMIP secret store to
connect to an existing KMIP server.

If a KMIP server is requested then also enable the 'pykmip-server'
service in the devstack configuration. This will install, configure,
and start the KMIP server. This option requires the 'barbican-pykmip'
service be configured as well.

Added passenv command to tox to allow the KMIP_PLUGIN_ENABLED
environment variable to be passed to the underlying command. Without
this the environment variable will not be seen by the tox command.

Currently, Nova does not check the validity of what the user provides for the
project id value in quota and flavor management activities. This leads to
inaccurate quota entries in the database, causing the user to think Nova isn't
reporting quota information accurately. The solution proposed in this blueprint
is to add project id validation specifically to quota and flavor management
through Keystone, to provide the user with an error if their specified project
id is invalid, and to ensure quota and flavor management data is not incorrectly
modified.

Occassionally during gate test, some containers
seem to be lacking or have an outdated 'ca-certificates'
package.

This patch adds ca-certificates to container cache prep
for the container build process.

SLO middleware appends a swift_bytes param to the content-type of
manifests, expecting the container server to extract its value and
return it as the object size in container listings.

The SLO copy_hook is not copying swift_bytes from a source manifest
to a destination manifest during a regular COPY or a post-as-copy
request. This results in the wrong size appearing in the container
listing for a manifest that has been COPYed or POSTed to.

This patch modifies the copy-hook to copy across any swift_bytes
from the source response to the sink request. Since the swift_bytes
param is currently removed from content-type in the object controller
GET path, this patch also relocates the call to clean_content_type from
the object controller to the SLO GET handler. That means that swift_bytes
is available to the SLO copy_hook, but now it won't be cleaned up if SLO
is ever removed from the proxy pipeline.

There is very little test coverage for the handling of the
swift_bytes param. This patch adds a unit test for the container
server and some functional tests for the SLO scenarios.

safe_utils.getcallargs was written to support python2.6 which did not
have inspect.getcallargs.  Now that support for python2.6 has been
dropped it should be replaced with inspect.getcallargs.

Note:The interface that safe_utils.getcallargs provides did not match
inspect.getcallargs around the handling of the self parameter needing to
be passed in. It should be brought inline with inspect.getcallargs so
that it can be dropped. Nova fixed in 2910d75b28afd909af3b4ac392729ac3d5e64b65.

The watch-file option currently relies on pyinotify which makes
use of select.poll. This is eventlet incompatible so it blocks
the whole thread for TIMEOUT milliseconds every READ_FREQ seconds.

This meant that an agent/service using this option is blocked for
500 milliseconds every 1 second.

Until a non-blocking alternative can be found, this adjusts the
READ_FREQ and TIMEOUT params on the FastWatchedFileHandler to
3 and 5 respectively. So every 3 seconds, it will block for 5
milliseconds so only 0.16% of time is lost instead of 50%.
