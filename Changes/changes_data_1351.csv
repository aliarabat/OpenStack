objects instead of querying conductor directly. This also affects
handle_lifecycle_event() as well, which now uses Instance to
fetch the instance for the event.

When deleting a network, dhcp ports are removed automatically

corresponding port exists on OFC and the network on OFC cannot
be deleted unless a subnet on the network is deleted explicitly.
This commit gets auto-delete ports and delete the corresponding

The issue was that the code worked for the first IO usage event (the

and following IO usage events the code path ended up comparing a datetime
object from the db with a cached string representation of the last_refreshed

This patch uses cfg.CONF as ConfigOpts in common/config instead of
creating a new instance of it. This is needed since most of Oslo's
modules use the global CONF object to register their config parameters.

The patch also moves log.setup call into Bootstrap and calls it after
configs are loaded.

This patch modifies the way message markers are generated and
used, such that Marconi can guarantee FIFO for a single message
producer posting to a single queue (FIFO for multiple producers
is not guaranteed.) At the same time, these changes guarantee
that observer clients will recieve messages once-and-only once
by removing race conditions inherent in timestamp-based markers.

Along the way, some technical debt was also addressed, particulary
regarding style, as well as some minor optimizations.

A new service, marconi-mongo-gc, was also added, and is required
when using the MongoDB storage driver for Marconi. This service
was necessary due to the special requirement that at least the
most recent message always remain in each queue, which is an
a-priori assumption upon which the FIFO/pagination algorithm
is based, and arises from the particular constraints imposed
by MongoDB's semantics.

Note: While implementing this blueprint, many calculated tradeoffs
were made in an attempt to balance performance, risk, readability,
and maintainability. The goal was to create a resonable baseline
implementation that can be iterated upon pending comprehensive
system and performance testing. Due to the many subtleties
of solving the FIFO/once-and-only-once problem for the MongoDB
driver, future contributors should excercise extreme caution when
modifying the algorithm introduced in this patch.

Changes include:
* Align text in comments
* Add counter to queue, messages
* Markers are now converted over to using monotonic counter
* Handle DuplicateKeyError
* Return resources in body as a response to a message POST
* Added mongo driver claims tests
* Return 503 when no messages were enqueued due to marker conflict
* Added backoff sleep between retries
* Added marconi-mongo-gc service. This is a new required servi

Sheepdog is a distributed block storage. This patch enables Sheepdog cluster
as a backend store for glance.

Test:

You can set up a simulated 3 node cluster on the local machine with
following script:

 $ sudo apt-get install liburcu-dev
 $ git clone git://github.com/collie/sheepdog.git
 $ cd sheepdog
 $ ./autogen.sh; ./configure --disable-corosync
 $ make; sudo make install
 $ for i in 0 1 2; do sheep /tmp/store$i -n -c local -z $i -p 700$i;done
 $ collie cluster format

Then change the default store in glance-api.conf as sheepdog

Commit 06d9437e8388b369546d760607f17cb5022750e9 made using a keyring
optional by adding a function to handle the imports. The problem is that
import needs to be available at a global level for it to be usable in
other parts of the code.

The function is replaced by a top-level try/except.

Fixing the imports isn't enough to get keyring support working because
in get_auth_ref_from_keyring() the wrong token was being used when
evaluating token expiration. It was using the token already in the
HTTPClient object and not the one returned from the keyring.

Some simple tests were added to prevent future regressions. These
tests will be skipped if the keyring or pickle packages are not
installed.

This check was introduced by the following change:
7c5c8a743c21733120c85fdefb84b4357f5848d0

This is an alternative fix to ensure resize down
is not processed if the disk cannot be resized.

Note the failure now registers an instance action
and does not leave the VM in an error state.

In addition, this keeps the behavior that a failure
to resize up and instance during spawn will not
cause the operation to fail and put the VM into error.

If live migration encounter some exception before nova scheduler
cast message to nova compute, nova scheduler will set the VM state
to ERROR and send notification, but the notification do not include
VM UUID, this might cause some problem if some components want to
handle the notification since those components will not able to know
the VM UUID about the notification.

The solution is add UUID to live migration error notification so other
components can get the related notification correctly.

This patch makes the start and stop operations use the Instance
object instead of passing SQLA-derived dicts over RPC. Until
something more sophisticated is needed (and developed), it also
adds a nova.object.register_all() function which just triggers
imports of all the object models so that they are registered.
When adding a new object type, that register function should be
updated appropriately.

Implements blueprint record-reason-for-disabling-service

We added a field to the service table to log a reason when a service has
been disabled.
We added a new API extension called os-extended-services. The new extension
will extend the os-services extension adding:
- A method for disabling a service and specify a reason for that.

PUT /v2/{tenant_id}/os-services/disable-log-reason

When the os-extended-extension is loaded the call:

GET /V2/{tenant_id}/os-services
will return the list of services with reason information it that exists.

DB models definition should be up-to-date with DB schema obtained after
applying of migrations. Currently, there are no tests enforcing this and it's
really hard to analyze what indexes should be added, and what indexes we have
at the moment.

So the first step is it to fix all models, and add missing descriptions about
Indexes and UniqueConstraints in __table_args__ and use explicit 'nullable'
parameter in columns description.

Add missing 'nullable' parameters to all Columns

Add empty __table_args__ parameter to Table

There is no indexes in ComputeNode model definition.

This commit adds support for utilizing the VXLAN tunneling protocol in versions
of Open vSwitch >= 1.10. This is configurable and will default to GRE if not
configured. As part of this commit, it is possible to configure the UDP port
VXLAN will utilize as well. VXLAN and GRE cannot be configured at the same
time with this patch. 2 new configuration file options are added to the AGENT
section of the config to support this: 'tunnel_type' and 'vxlan_udp_port'.
In addition, the agent no longer makes use of enable_tunneling, as this can
be determined if tunnel_type is set.

Note: The VXLAN functionality utilized here is what is implemented in Open
vSwitch itself, and is different than the VXLAN functionality in the
upstream Linux kernel. The code validates both the userspace and kernel
pieces of OVS to verify if VXLAN functionality can be supported on the
running system

Using a 'for' loop on a generator is incompatible with calling throw() on
it, because the latter causes the generator to advance to the next yield.
Consequently, ignoring an exception from a subtask in the parent task would
cause the next subtask to be skipped.

This issue does not affect any existing code to date.

The inner and outer loops should each be equivalent to the definition of
""yield from"" (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/#formal-semantics) in
PEP 380, with the following simplifications:
 - Assume that the throw() and close() methods exist
 - Don't support send()
 - Don't support return values (these are Python 3-only feature)

Previously if adding a security group to an instance it would fail
if the port did not contain port_security_enabled=True. This patch
also changes the unit tests so that networks by default are not
associated with port_security_enabled=True because this is only true
if a plugin is running the port_security extension.

When an exception happens in an RPC call using nova cells, it can travel
back up several RPC boundaries. eg, child-cell=>parent-cell=>nova-api

Before this patch if an exception (eg. AggregateNotFound) was raised in
the bottom layer, the next layer up would turn it into a special
exception ( AggregateNotFound_Remote ), then in the final layer, it would
see this as an unrecognizable exception and raise RemoteException.

After this patch, at each layer where the expeption is deserialized,
it'll recognize exceptions with the _Remote postfix, and leave them as
they are, instead of turning them into RemoteExceptions.

It also preserves the exception's original __module__ now.

When using the routes mapper's collection to map from URLs to
python functions several additional URIs are created by
default: 'new', 'format' and 'edit', eg this URI

/v1/images/new

was accessible and would return a '500'.

/v1/images/detail.xxx

was accessible and a 'GET' to it would create a file called 'detail.xxx'
in the image cache directory (where 'xxx' is an arbitrary string).

Similar resources for image memberships existed.

Other collection URIs (for both the API and Registry) would return
unexpected behaviour.

Use explicit mappings rather than a 'collection' to remove
the superfluous resources.

Fixes bug 1185828.

Based on discussions during and after the Ironic team meeting on June
03, regarding support for substantially different driver work flows,
this is a re-working of the internal driver API.

tl;dr: The strict separation of ""control"" and ""deploy"" driver was an
       artefact of the ipmi + pxe implementation used in nova-baremetal,
       and does not map on to all drivers. Furthermore, the prior
       implementation did not accurately represent the separation of
       ""core"", ""standard"", and ""vendor-specific"" driver functionality.

These changes impact the v1 API structure, but since that is largely not
implemented yet, this change does not attempt to affect the public API
itself.

Highlights:
- No more deploy + control driver; nodes have one and only one driver.
  This drops the deploy_driver and deploy_info parameters,
  and renames control_driver -> driver, and control_info -> driver_info.
- Interfaces for core, standard, and vendor functionality now clearly
  defined in the driver API.
- Improve Fake driver to demonstrate use of interfaces.
- Convert IPMI and SSH driver classes into interfaces, and move to
  drivers/modules/ directory.
- Stub for the pxe interfaces.
- Stub implementations of pxe+ipmi and pxe+ssh drivers.
- driver_info field uses more standard names, but requires
  driver-specific data to be in a nested object. Examples in
  tests/db/utils.py as before.

A separate doc change will follow this to update the API v1 spec.

Also includes some cosmetic cleanup of test_ssh.py and test_ipmi.py.

Now you can configure the proxy server to read from ""local"" primary
nodes first, where ""local"" is governed by the newly-introduced
""read_affinity"" setting in the proxy config. This is desirable when
the network links between regions/zones are of varying capacities; in
such a case, it's a good idea to prefer fetching data from closer
backends.

The new setting looks like rN[zM]=P, where N is the region number, M
is the optional zone number, and P is the priority. Multiple values
can be specified by separating them with commas. The priority for
nodes that don't match anything is a very large number, so they'll
sort last.

This only affects the ordering of the primary nodes; it doesn't affect
handoffs at all. Further, while the primary nodes are reordered for
all requests, it only matters for GET/HEAD requests since handling the
other verbs ends up making concurrent requests to *all* the primary
nodes, so ordering is irrelevant.

Note that the default proxy config does not have this setting turned
on, so the default configuration's behavior is unaffected.

See Bug 1187200 for a full description of the problem.

Part 1:

X-Delete-At-Container added to X-Delete-At-* info

This fixes the bug by passing the expiring-objects-account's
container name onward to the backend object servers. This is in case
the object servers' expiring_objects_container_divisor happens to be
different than the proxy server's, we want to make sure the host,
partition, and device match up with the container name. Different
container names would be fine, but not with mismatched host,
partition, and device info.

Part 2:

The db_replicator now double checks the disk path's partition against
the partition the ring gives back. If they don't match, it logs the
problem but continues to replicate the database to where it should be
and, on success to all proper nodes, removes the local out of place
database.

bug #1100147

The existing VMware Nova docs were very outdated, incomplete,
and in a few cases, just plan wrong.  They also did not cover the new
VMwareVCDriver and associated updates that arrived in Grizzly.  This
commit removes a lot of stale content (and even graphics) and adds the
basic instructions for both the VMwareVCDriver and the VMwareESXDriver.

I filed an additional bug for some topics (disk details, vnc) that
I did not already cover (bug #1175000)

As we are planning to deprecate the wsgi module, move it
out of the main openstack/common folder to the new
""deprecated"" folder.

Move some of the middleware classes into the middleware
package, since those are still useful and should be
maintained.

There's still work to do to remove the dependency of the
size limit middleware on the Request class in the now
deprecated wsgi module.

Some databases (e.g., DB2) would deadlock on migration 16 because a
lock was held on the domain table for an uncommitted alter and then
SQLAlchemy queried the domain table info in a separate transaction.

The fix is to commit the ALTER statements to release the lock so
that the domain table schema query will not block.

The bug has been encountered with the NFS generic driver
(cinder.volume.nfs.NfsDriver) and the NetApp NFS driver
(cinder.volume.drivers.netapp.nfs.NetAppDirectCmodeNfsDriver). I believe
that drivers based on distributed filesystem such as GlusterFS, nexenta

However since most of them already inherit from the RemoteFsDriver
class, this should be fine.

This patch migrates the DB to the new data format. In addition it also
utilizes routines introduced in the change
I9370333059b8c9aaf92010470b8475a913d329b2 in a way that will allow us
to transition into using the new data in Nova logic one step at a time.

This is accomplished in a following manner in the DB/conductor layer,
which is supposed to allow for subsequent changes to be as granular as
possible:

* Read operations - data is always read as is found in the DB - meaning
in the new format, and transformed after every call. This will allow us
to make granular changes in the API/Compute layers.

* Data is converted inside the DB methods that do writes, and an
additional 'legacy' flag is added (set to True by default). It is up to
the calling method to make sure it supplies the DB layer with the format
it is intending to write, to avoid guessing.

An exception to the above is when using conductor due to rpcapi
versioning, so this patch adds a 'legacy' flag to the
block_device_mapping_get_all_by_instance conductor method and bumps the
version of the API.

This patch also fixes some of the block device fixtures in tests, when it was
required to be aware of the new data structure (mostly when mocking DB
methods that return the new data format).

This patch is not supposed to provide any new functionality to Nova.

This problem surfaced when Red Hat QA started installing Grizzly
and hit a regression from Folsom. If something is wrong with
permissions (it may be SElinux, or any other problem), the servers
in 1.8.0 enter a loop, spamming logs with huge tracebacks at a rate
of a one to two each second, depending how many workers are there.
In 1.7.4, the server exited with an error message.

The offending commit is 9efa9be167b972a234ecccd9ba37bdd8a949381e,
""Separate wsgi init from web-front-end activation"". It relocates
the probing invocation of loadapp() in front of drop_privileges().
But in such case, it runs as root and thus may succeed while the
rest of the server fails.

The fix is to return loadapp to the place it was in Folsom. Since
the init_request_processor() is used when running under Apache,
preserve that API too.

DB models definition should be up-to-date with DB schema obtained after applying of
migrations. Currently, there are no tests enforcing this and it's really hard to
analyze what indexes should be added, and what indexes we have at the moment.

So the first step is it to fix all models, and add missing descriptions about
Indexes and UniqueConstraints in __table_args__ and use explicit 'nullable'
parameter in columns description.

Add missing 'nullable' parameters to all Columns

Add empty __table_args__ parameter to Table

There is no indexes and no unique constraints in this table at this moment.

This patch adds the utility functions that will help us switch
between versions of block device mapping data.

In order to accomplish this, and to have a more structured approach to
dealing with block device mapping data in the future, this patch
introduces a BlockDeviceDict class which is a thin wrapper around a
standard dict that makes it easier to reason about which fields are
present in the dictionary, and introduces said conversion routines.

The patch replaces gunicorn with wsgiref since it doesn't make sense to
have gunicorn as dependency. Lets let deployers choose whatever the
prefer to use as container.

The patch also removes lib/* since marconi_paste is not needed anymore,
the wsgi app can now be accessed through:

    `marconi.transport.wsgi.app:app`

Backward incompatible change: bind refers now to the host and a new
config variable was introduced to specify the port it should bind to.

Fixes bug: #1187280
Implements blueprint: transport-wsgi

quantum has existing tables, which are out of date for Grizzly.
These new tables will need to be linked in, but first submitting these for
review without linking them in to a book yet, because feedback is needed.

Please provide feedback on:
* completeness (is every option and its description present)
* groupings (is every option in the right group)
* potential integrations (can you see where one or more of these
tables could be combined under a nice descriptive paragraph)
* relationships to config files (are these useful as is, or how to
best integrate them with examples)
* anything else you can think of

Fixes bug 1185588

The only way to reliably determine whether we are using a legacy
(pre-Grizzly) backing structure is to look at the backing file
reference for the instance/disk itself. Thus, if we determine the
backing file contains an underscore, we use the value following it
as our legacy_backing_size, which is then used to create the
necessary backing file.

Database access is costly in tests and many tests
don't actually need it. This patch provides a
simple way we can speed up the Nova tests by
providing a new base class, `NoDBTestCase` which
allows us to white-list tests not needing database
access.

The following speedups were observed:

    With TestCase:     Ran 265 tests in 17.080s
    With NoDBTestCase: Ran 265 tests in  9.478s

Further optimizaton could be done by fixing
`test_host_filters` to not hit the database. This
will require some effort though in order to
maintain the quality of test coverage since part
of what's doing is testing the code in the DB
layer.

`InvalidKeyPair` exceptions weren't raising the
proper error message. The reason was that the
error message was passed in as an `explanation`
keyword which isn't understood by `NovaException`,
and so is thrown away.
