This splits out the right bits into a base job, and then both

The create-node.sh and cleanup-node.sh scripts are called with sudo -E
but then runs su which will break the env we were initially trying to
preserve. This is important so that devstack can control things like
$PATH for determining the path to vbmc. Address this by adding a -p to
the su call which should preserve the environment for us.

Unfortunately for PATH specifically even using sudo -E has a tendency
for sanitizing PATH. We work around this behavior by explicitly setting
$PATH in the commands being run by sudo su.

Note that the su appears to be necessary to have the stack user pick up
its new libvirt group membership which allows it to successfully use
virsh to start the virtual baremetal instances.

Per the referenced bug, there was a code path whereby the boot volume
connectivity type could be unset, resulting in an exception.  In fixing
this, I discovered that we were looking for `driver_volume_type` in the
wrong place: it should be in connection_info and we were looking for it
under connection_info['data'].  I preserved the bogus code path in case
it's actually somehow legit, but added a path to the correct location.

We had no direct test for this stuff, so I added that too.

hacking is not capped in g-r and it is in
blacklist for requirement as hacking new version
can break the gate jobs.

Hacking can break gate jobs because of various
reasons:
- There might be new rule addition in hacking
- Some rules becomes default from non-default
- Updates in pycodestyle etc

That was the main reason it was not added in g-r

Increases the amount of ram for CoreOS IPA to 2GB
as the base CoreOS image is now 310MB.

Bumped CPU count for CoreOS runs to 2 CPUs as the
concurrency helps boot times for the CoreOS ramdisk.

Adds netbase, udev, and open-iscsi to debian jessie container
as they are no longer present in the default container.

Explicitly set path variable for execution in the debian
container as udevadm is in /sbin, and we may not have
/sbin on the path that is passed through to the
chroot.

Also fixed new pep8 test failures.

At present the Libvirt driver can preallocate file based disks using the
fallocate command and importantly the `-n` option. This option allocates
blocks on the filesystem past the initial EOF of a given file:

```
$ touch test.img ; fallocate -n -l $(( 1024 * 1024 )) test.img
$ ll -lah test.img
-rw-rw-r--. 1 stack stack 0 Apr 16 13:28 test.img
$ du -h test.img
1.0M	test.img
```

This results in a miscalculation of the total disk overcommit for file
based (excluding ploop) disks as os.path.getsize is currently used to
determine the allocated size of these disks:

```
>>> import os
>>> os.path.getsize('test.img')
0
```

Using the above example the disk overcommit would be reported as 1.0M as
the disk appears empty yet will report a potential (virtual) size of 1.0M.

However as the required blocks have already been allocated on the
filesystem the host will report disk_available_least as missing an
additional 1.0M, essentially doubling the allocation for each disk.

To correct this the allocated size of file based (excluding ploop) disks
is reported using `disk_size` from the `qemu-img info` command. This
should ensure blocks allocated past the EOF of the file are taken into
account and correctly reported as allocated.

A future change should ultimately remove the use of the `-n` option with
fallocate, however as this would not help disks that have already been
allocated this has not been included in this change to simplify backports.

The default in our OVB and nodepool based jobs is multi-nic. This
patch (along with the depends-on), will do the same for libvirt.

In order to use the multiple nic form of network isolation, the
undercloud VM needs to be created with seven nics and the overcloud
VMs each need six. In addition the undercloud needs to configure
the external interface for the overcloud VMs so that it has an IP.

Both multi-nic and single-nic-vlans continue to work and are
supported in libvirt deployments.

There already exists a function _get_trees_matching_all() that
returns trees that meet the required resource and traits constraints.

However, this function can be only used when there is no sharing
provider in the environment. This is because it abondons a tree with
few resource or few traits without looking into sharing providers.
When there are both nested resource providers and shared resource
providers, we should check both providers for each resource class.

This patch renames `get_all_with_shared()` function to
`get_all_with_nested_and_shared()` and change it to consider nested
providers as well as sharing providers.

This patch also provides `_get_nested_providers_with_capacity()`
function which returns nested providers, each of which have capacity
for a requested amount.

In following patches, we are going to build allocation candidates
with the following caveats:

a) If there is no sharing provider in the environment
 1. Get root providers with _get_trees_matching_all()
 2. Get nested providers with _get_nested_providers_with_capacity()
    only for the descendents of the root providers gotten
 3. Combine them using the existing function
    _alloc_candidates_with_shared() renaming it to
    _alloc_candidates_with_nested_and_shared()

b) If there are sharing providers in the enviroment
 1. Get root providers with _get_all_with_shared() renaming it
    to _get_all_with_nested_and_shared
 2. Get nested providers with _get_nested_providers_with_capacity()
    only for the descendents of the root providers gotten

 4. Combine them all using the existing function
    _alloc_candidates_with_shared() renaming it to
    _alloc_candidates_with_nested_and_shared()

so that we can use the same code path as much as possible for the
differnet cases, which means less codes, less maintenance and less
bugs.

This patch prepares a path mainly in b-1.

It seems that at times of high concurrency, libvirt
occassionally fails on supposedly some race condition
what leads to client failure (e.g. Ironic). This change
is to retry libvirt calls for some more times rather
than bailing out right away.

This updates the relevant environment/services templates so that
they also default to docker. Without this change users of these
services could end up with mismatched (unsupported) deployments.

Additionally, this picks environment/services-docker as the
source of truth when resolving collisions for moving those over
environment/services. So environment/services now contain all of
the containerized services' env files used to be located in
environment/services-docker. The latter will be deleted later to
prevent future desync of contents.

Patch [1] introduced new way of subnet creation in
neutron-tempest-plugin repository.
Tempest tests for dynamic routing are using code from
neutron-tempet-plugin repo and that caused problem because
here during some scenario tests subnets are created from
earlied created subnetpool and have same cidr for each test.
That cause conflicts as new way of cidrs generation in
neutron-tempest-plugin tries to allocate different CIDR for each
subnet.

This patch overrides
neutron_tempest_plugin.api.base.BaseNetworkTest.create_subnet()
method that it allows to create subnets with same CIDR.

Change Ic683f83e428106df64be42287e2c5f3b40e73da4 added some disk
cleanup logic to _cleanup_resize because some image backends (Qcow2,
Flat and Ploop) will re-create the instance directory and disk.info
file when initializing the image backend object.

However, that change did not take into account volume-backed instances
being resized will not have a root disk *and* if the local disk is
shared storage, removing the instance directory effectively deletes
the instance files, like the console.log, on the destination host
as well. Change I29fac80d08baf64bf69e54cf673e55123174de2a was made
to resolve that issue.

However (see the pattern?), if you're doing a resize of a
volume-backed instance that is not on shared storage, we won't remove
the instance directory from the source host in _cleanup_resize. If the
admin then later tries to live migrate the instance back to that host,
it will fail with DestinationDiskExists in the pre_live_migration()
method.

This change is essentially a revert of
I29fac80d08baf64bf69e54cf673e55123174de2a and alternate fix for
Ic683f83e428106df64be42287e2c5f3b40e73da4. Since the root problem
is that creating certain imagebackend objects will recreate the
instance directory and disk.info on the source host, we simply need
to avoid creating the imagebackend object. The only reason we are
getting an imagebackend object in _cleanup_resize is to remove
image snapshot clones, which is only implemented by the Rbd image
backend. Therefore, we can check to see if the image type supports
clones and if not, don't go through the imagebackend init routine
that, for some, will recreate the disk.

hacking is not capped in g-r and it is in
blacklist for requirement as hacking new version
can break the gate jobs.

Hacking can break gate jobs because of various
reasons:
- There might be new rule addition in hacking
- Some rules becomes default from non-default
- Updates in pycodestyle etc

That was the main reason it was not added in g-r
auto sync also. Most of the project maintained the
compatible and cap the hacking version in
test-requirements.txt and update to new version when
project is ready. Bumping new version might need code
fix also on project side depends on what new in that
version.

If project does not have cap the hacking version then,
there is possibility of gate failure whenever new hacking
version is released by QA team.

Example of such failure in recent release of hacking 1.1.0

Those attributes of Neutron's router are by default blocked by

This patch changes it by removing default value set to False for those

None which should be less confusing for users.

Stale resource allocations can prevent Nova from scheduling new

Nova would log a message about this situation on the affected compute

This commit modifies Nova to log the message as a warning instead.

This is necessary for networking-midonet.  See [2].
Note: this is not a library. It provides a Neutron service plugin
as some of Neutron subprojects like neutron-vpnaas do.
networking-midonet has a driver for this service plugin and
associated unit tests, which currently requires this.

This commit doesn't add it to blacklist.txt because:
	- as far as I know, networking-midonet is the only project which
	  uses tox_install to install tap-as-a-service
	- and its gate is currently broken and we plan to retire

The following answers the questions on:
https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/dependency-management.html#for-new-requirements

> Is the library actively maintained?

It's maintained.  Not very active these days though.

> Is the library good code?

It's following Neutron standard. (loosely)

> Is the library python 3 compatible?

Yes.

> Is the library license compatible?

Yes. Same license as Neutron.

> Is the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu latest / Fedora latest)?

https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=python-neutron-taas

I have no idea about Fedora.

> Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries in global-requirements.txt?

No.

> Is the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or infrastructure setup? (Answer to this should be Yes, of course) Which?

Yes. networking-midonet has a driver for this project.

> If the library release is managed by the Openstack release process does it use the cycle-with-intermediary release type?

No. It isn't a library.
Ideally it should be cycle-with-milestones.

> Do I need to update anything else?

I'm not sure what this question means.

In case when external bridge configured in OVS agent's bridge_mappings

That might cause broken connectivity for OpenStack's dataplane if

To encrypt a volume with luks, we need following two steps:[1]
1. create the luks encryptor with volume connection_info.
   connection_info['data']['device_path'] is the symlink to
   the real device.
2. call encryptor.attach_volume to open the volume.
   attach_volume finds the real device from the symlink,
   then create a encrypted partition from the real device.
   At last, it points the symlink to the encrypted partition
   instead of the device.

Thinking that we call attach_volume again.
1. create luks encryptor with connectioninfo.
2. Now attach_volume wants to find the real device from the symlink.
   But it will get the partition instead of the device.
   Because it had pointed the symlink to the encrypted partition
   in last attach_volume.

This patch is to check if volume is already opened before attach_volume
opens the volume. Also do the check before closing volume.

it's connector properties from os-brick.

So it follows that os-brick would start modeling it's connector

New provider constants were introduced during Ocata by
Ic155bd29d46059832cce970bf60375e7e472eca6 that in turn deprecated the
use of encryptor class paths or names to identity each encryptor.

The removal of the support for the use of these paths and names was
delayed in Pike by Ib8ca7ecb5494cd4fcae0657525d4c17bfc4ae37e after it
was noted that support would need to remain until Newton hit EOL.

As this is now the case we can finally remove support in Rocky once
Id221414d74af8413084c7935b762f93b7ce43c42 has removed the remaining
references from Tempest.

The keystoneclient package is being installed on the host by PIP but
that means that a whole bunch of required dependencies are being pulled
in as well.

This brings the host to a rather messed up state when installing
keystone from distro packages, since distribution and
PIP packages are being mixed together. We can simply avoid that by
only using the virtualenv where required, in which the keystone client
would be installed. We still require the virtualenv package to be
installed on the host from PIP at the moment to get the expected
recent version of pip inside the virtualenv.

This reverts commit 9f7bfb9f6bc3d561c9a669e9bed3364d610a9642.

It seems that the SOL feature introduced by patch [1] led to
the VirtualBMC daemons leaking two file descriptors (ends of
UNIX pipe, perhaps) per each IPMI query it processes. Given the
default ulimit of 1024 open files per process, in circa 500 IPMI
queries vbmc renders itself not quite functional.

The quick research of the problem reveals that the leak comes
to life once the virEventRegisterDefaultImpl() call is made
which prepares libvirt for asynchronous operations over a dedicated
connection to libvirtd. Even though once SOL session is gone and
libvirt is cleaned up (well, dedicated connection is closed),
the libvirt connection, which is open every time when IPMI query
comes in, leaks 2 FDs per query.

This problem has been reported about some other libvirt application
in the past [2] so the problem might go away if we turn the IPMI
part of vbmc to the asynchronous operation mode as well.

Another observation is that libvirt API may not [3] offer a full
clean up upon exiting from the asynchronous operation mode.

To summarize: the real cause of this behaviour is not yet properly
understood.

already is.

Distributions provide packages for all the Tempest role dependencies
so we can use these instead of the ones from PIP in order to keep
the host as clean as possible. openSUSE provides suitable versions for
all of them, whereas Ubuntu provides everything except for shade which
we still need to get from PIP. Similarly, CentOS provides everything
except from virtualenv but this is being installed in the
openstack_hosts role.

Since we are still mixing distribution and pip packages, we need to
stop using upper-constrains when installing pip packages on the host
so distro packages can be used to satisfy their dependencies.

reduce the maintenance burden on the community when sweeping changes are
needed. The exterior role is built to be OSA compatible and may be pulled
into tree should we deem it necessary.

gentoo is currently failing with [1]

suse appears to be having issues with glean [2]

Although we added a back-off for cases where builds fail like on
gentoo, it still tries to build 3 times and takes over an hour.  We
don't have a back-off for the suse case of hosts not coming up, so we
just timeout the job.

Move both to experimental to unblock the gate as we work on this.

When using a target virtual environment for kolla-ansible [1], it is possible
to get a Permission Denied error. This can occur if the permissions of
/opt/kayobe or /opt/kayobe/venvs are restricted to the stack user (0700), since
kolla ansible uses the kolla user.

Although it makes sense for /opt/kayobe/venvs/kayobe to be 0700, /opt/kayobe
and /opt/kayobe/venvs should be 0755 to allow the kolla user to access a
virtualenv in /opt/kayobe/venvs/kolla-ansible.

This was seen during deployment of a seed, with kayobe target virtualenvs [2]
also in use. Since the kayobe-target-venv.yml playbook is one of the first
playbooks to be run, it will create the /opt/kayobe and /opt/kayobe/venvs
directories, and set the permissions correctly.

  * 'normal': the 'classic' tap-style VNIC plugged into the instance,
  * 'direct': a PCI Virtual Function is passed through to the instance,
  * 'virtio-forwarder': a PCI Virtual Function is proxied to the

* The libvirt xml generation code was updated to support the modes.

* The Nova legacy VIF plugging code was updated to support the modes.

file mode on the files that contain the private key so that they

This commit adds the --by-service flag in the discover_hosts

hosts are mapped based on the existing nova-compute services instead
of using the compute node reference.

In this way, we can ensure that the host mappings exists
for this new host (and create it if not) preventing the
HostMappingNotFound exception to loop over and over.

Commit c68db4e6 refactored a task into two tasks and in the process
misspelled the variable registered in the first task within the
condition of the second task.  The undefined state of the misspelled
variable was unintentionally handled in this case because under
different circumstances the variable is expected to be undefined (ie
when the first task is skipped).

instance is actually in. In the case where no AZ was requested at
boot, previously this would always be some default value, which
isn't as useful to the things that need to consider what AZ the

If coerce's value arg is a unicode string, then the method will return
unicode [3]. Subsequent checks for isinstance(str) [4] will fail and a
TypeError will be raised trying to handle the uuid as an int in the
else block. This change ensures that the uuid is an instance of str so
that it is handled properly. This problem was fixed in pypowervm 1.1.15
[5] and the minimum version was bumped for master. However, we can't
backport the pypowervm requirements bump to the stable branches so we
have to fix it here.

This lock was taken two places:

1. when cleaving into a shard broker
2. when removing misplaced objects from a shard broker

These two operations would not execute concurrently if there is just
one sharder process running.  If there were more than one sharder
process, each processing different nodes, then they might visit the
same db when one is visiting the parent container and cleaving to the
shard and one is visiting the shard container and handling misplaced
objects. However, any objects merged by the cleaving process will not
be removed by the misplaced object process because the removal is
limited to a max row count that is sampled at the start of the
misplaced objects handling. It is therefore not necessary to protect
these operations with a lock.

hacking is not capped in g-r and it is in
blacklist for requirement as hacking new version
can break the gate jobs.

Hacking can break gate jobs because of various
reasons:
- There might be new rule addition in hacking
- Some rules becomes default from non-default
- Updates in pycodestyle etc

That was the main reason it was not added in g-r
auto sync also. Most of the project maintained the
compatible and cap the hacking version in
test-requirements.txt and update to new version when
project is ready. Bumping new version might need code
fix also on project side depends on what new in that
version.

If project does not have cap the hacking version then,
there is possibility of gate failure whenever new hacking
version is released by QA team.

Example of such failure in recent release of hacking 1.1.0

In certain use cases, you may be listening on a different interface
and it is not possible to listen to multiple interfaces with MySQL.

This changes the behaviour to connect via the local socket, as
Galera treats 'localhost' as a connection via the UNIX socket and
'127.0.0.1' as using the TCP socket.

This will allow using Galera on a specific interface while still
letting the bootstrap process talk to the local machine via the
socket which is still available.

WebOb 1.8.1 removes a function (deprecated for a long time) that
Glance uses for negotiating 'Accept-Language' headers.  The removed
function is replaced by a function that implements the ""Lookup""
scheme defined in RFC 4647.

Glance wraps the webob.Request object and provides a convenience
method around the old function.  This patch uses the new webob
function in the convenience method and wraps it in such a way that
the convenience method preserves its current behavior (at least with
respect to the Glance tests).  But ... ""Lookup"" is compliant with RFC
7231, whereas the old function was not.  This means that given
sufficiently complex Accept-Language header values (containing
q-values), the best match under webob 1.8.1 will be different from
the best match under webob 1.7.x.  Given that the best match will,
however, be RFC 7231 compliant, this is an acceptable change.

One further complication is that the lookup() function is not
available in webob 1.7.x.  Thus this patch handles both versions.  I
suggest that as soon as WebOb===1.8.1 is merged into
lower_constraints, the code be simplified to handle 1.8.x only, and
the following release note be submitted with that patch:

Negotiation of the 'Accept-Language' header now follows the ""Lookup""
matching scheme described in `RFC 4647, section 3.4
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647.html#section-3.4>`_.  The
""Lookup"" scheme is one of the algorithms suggested in `RFC 7231,
section 5.3.5
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html#section-5.3.5>`_.  (This is
due to a change in an underlying library, which previously used a
matching scheme that did not conform to `RFC 7231
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html>`_.)

the image does not exist.

Removed glance-direct from defaults for enabled_import_methods. If
operator wants to enable import method 'glance-direct', then
operators need to enable it explicitly with enabling NFS across

Once a shard range has been successfully cleaved by one sharding node
then other nodes are likely to need to usync to it, progressing at
100k rows per visit (by default). This can slow down cleaving on other
nodes because each shard range may require many visits before usync
completes.

The existing_shard_replication_quorum allows the replication quorum to
be reduced once a shard range is known to have been cleaved by at
least one node. It may even be reduced to zero, since it can be assumed
that the shard db for a CLEAVED shard range has been replicated to at
least one of its primary nodes.

Most notably, taskflow is hitting the sphinx issue
https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/2549 which causes a
spurious warning that breaks the build with -W.  There is a
workaround posted in
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31784830/sphinx-ivar-tag-goes-looking-for-cross-references
to move :ivar: docstrings to inline comments on the member variable
itself.  This is not ideal because it causes the docs to render
differently from :ivar:, but until the sphinx bug is fixed it will
allow us to keep documenting the problematic variables.

There was also a problem with one of the doctests because the
output had changed.  That is now fixed.

I also noticed a typo in one of the parameter descriptions so that
is fixed too.

DO NOT MERGE

THIS PATCH IS FOR INVESTIGATING TO SATISFY PASSING CI JOBS
AND RUNNING TOX LOCALLY.

Install horizon from git into test environment both of CI infra and local

Horizon plugins needs to test with horizon on master branch.
So we should install horizon from git into test environment on both of
CI infra and local for each jobs.

This patch fixes settings on tox.ini and requirements.txt files.

[BACKGROUND]
Since Rocky cycle started, horizon installation from tarball was
deprecated, and changed to install from git.  But the change causes
that installation using requirements.txt is not to work for install from git.

So infra team added the horizon installation on CI infra,
but it does not work on local tox test.

So I'm trying to fix the way to install horizon from
master branch into test environment on both of CI infra and local.
As result, I have added tox_helper.sh to install horizon from git.
But tox_helper.sh is overseded solution.

I concluded the way to install horizon from master,
i.e. using ""pip install -U [horizon repo]"" on ""commands"" in tox.ini,
that is the most simple and reasonable.

So this patch revirts the complicated tox_helper.sh and changes to
use pip install from git repository.

For the docs job, it does not run tox on CI infra, so the way to
install horizon from master into test environment on CI infra is
limited only the use of ""required-project"" in job settings,
e.g. .zuul.yaml for now.
This means that we should install horizon using tox commands
for local independently.

For the lower-constraints job, we have to set horizon to beta version
in requirements.txt and lower-constraints.txt as soon as possible for
our development on master branch. But we need to use horizon on master
for everyday's development, especially until release of beta version
of horizon, otherwise our changes are going to get failure on this job.

And make basepython default to python3.5.

Also, this patch switch mox to mock, according to plan for Rocky on
Horizon team. Especially horizon installation manner effects onto
new changes like this change.

Removing no-ops from plan only will have no effect, we need to let
Heat know about the no-ops removal too. Client commands always fully
recreate the plan in swift, so any plan edits need to be immediately
applied.

For the same reason this commit also drops execution of the workfow --
so far we thought it's just superfluous (does what the env file did),
but in fact can't have any effect at all, so let's not execute that
code at all.

This patch deletes a duplicative test and enhance it to validate a
case where a compute node's local disk is not enough while there
is a shared storage with enough disk.

This case has been already fixed thanks to new _exceeds_capacity
function from commit 9af073384cca305565e741c1dfbb359c1e562a4e.

In the current progress of filtering glance image tags,
there are two problems:
1 When use ""repo:tag"" to pull image , if the glance image
tags were not updated , we will not get it even though the
glance image is what we want.
2 the current progress use update time to filter glance images,
this is an unreliable parameters which with some randomness.

we can use repo to find glance image firstly, if more than one
image is returned, then use tag to filter.

as both dict values and attributes, so the caller doesn't have to
remember which type of attribute they're accessing.

Change I751fcb7532679905c4279744919c6cce84a11eb4 modified
the ComputeDriver.detach_volume method signature to pass
the RequestContext as the first argument. This was missed
in the volume attach rollback code where the driver.detach_volume
method is called. It was missed because that is called
in a try/except block which catches generic Exception, which
also means that the unit test covering that flow, which
raised an Exception, was not failing.

This change fixes the code bug and re-writes the test to
use mock rather than mox and explicitly assert the calls made.

An alternative to this would be changing the generic
Exception handling in the rollback code, however, the
virt drivers raise things other than NovaException, like
os-brick exceptions and libvirtError, so refactoring that
error handling is non-trivial.

Stale resource allocations can prevent Nova from scheduling new
instances on a host that otherwise has sufficient resources available.
Nova would log a message about this situation on the affected compute
node, but it was logged at DEBUG priority and so would typically not
be visible in a production environment.

This commit modifies Nova to log the message as a warning instead.

Change I751fcb7532679905c4279744919c6cce84a11eb4 modified
the ComputeDriver.detach_volume method signature to pass
the RequestContext as the first argument. This was missed
in the volume attach rollback code where the driver.detach_volume
method is called. It was missed because that is called
in a try/except block which catches generic Exception, which
also means that the unit test covering that flow, which
raised an Exception, was not failing.

This change fixes the code bug and re-writes the test to
use mock rather than mox and explicitly assert the calls made.

An alternative to this would be changing the generic
Exception handling in the rollback code, however, the
virt drivers raise things other than NovaException, like
os-brick exceptions and libvirtError, so refactoring that
error handling is non-trivial.

Implements NVMeOF driver to support NVMe target CLI.
A new target, NVMET, is added for the LVM driver, and allows
cinder to use nvmetcli in order to create/delete subsystems
on attaching/detaching an LVM volume.

By choosing target_helper as nvmet, target_protocol as rdma,
other parameters can be configured too in cinder.conf like
nvmet_port_id, nvmet_ns_id (for namespace) and
nvmet_subsystem_name. The target IP and port, that will be
used by nvmecli OS-brick NVMe connector, are taken from
target_ip and target_port in cinder.conf.

Implements: blueprint nvme-target-cli

Presently when a host_mapping is deleted during the nova-manage cell_v2
delete_cell operation, the compute node record still remains with its
mapped field set to 1. Due to this, if we delete a cell, and later
create a new cell, the discover_hosts command will not work and the
compute node will not get mapped to the new cell. This patch fixes this
issue by setting it back to 0.

Conflicts:
    nova/tests/unit/test_nova_manage.py

NOTE(tssurya): The conflict is due to not having the change
Ibefa0465224bec9a22431c7d3b5c8f5d91fc7732 in Queens and Pike.

Also note that since HostMappingList.get_all() function is not
there in Pike, the functional test uses HostMapping.get_by_host()

Per the referenced bug, there was a code path whereby the boot volume
connectivity type could be unset, resulting in an exception.  In fixing
this, I discovered that we were looking for `driver_volume_type` in the
wrong place: it should be in connection_info and we were looking for it
under connection_info['data'].  I preserved the bogus code path in case
it's actually somehow legit, but added a path to the correct location.

We had no direct test for this stuff, so I added that too.

fix difference between Python 2 and Python 3 values by switching
from using str() to formatting into a unicode string (u""%s"").

This is equivalent to changing str() to unicode(), but that is
not correct for expected default string types for Python 2.
This requires either using six.text_type(), or just formatting
into a string, without forcing unicode (""%s""), to be correct on
either runtime.

repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

There are timeout issues as well as sometimes something goes wrong in
the shade floating ip tests. Update the tests to try to make them more
stable.

This also fixes a bug in find_available_ip that was causing ips with
port_ids to be returned that was accidentally working in the functional
tests as a race condition.

While working on this, pycodestyle made a release and broke us. Add pep8
changes to allow landing this patch. Fix two of them, ignore two of them.

hacking is not capped in g-r and it is in
blacklist for requirement as hacking new version
can break the gate jobs.

Hacking can break gate jobs because of various
reasons:
- There might be new rule addition in hacking
- Some rules becomes default from non-default
- Updates in pycodestyle etc

That was the main reason it was not added in g-r
auto sync also. Most of the project maintained the
compatible and cap the hacking version in
test-requirements.txt and update to new version when
project is ready. Bumping new version might need code
fix also on project side depends on what new in that
version.

If project does not have cap the hacking version then,
there is possibility of gate failure whenever new hacking
version is released by QA team.

Example of such failure in recent release of hacking 1.1.0
- http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2018-May/130282.html

Also fixes the lower-constraints file to allow the CI to pass.

Running the os_tempest role on Vagrant VMs often leads to the following
error:

==> ubuntu1604: ERROR: InvocationError for command '/bin/bash -c /vagrant/tests/common/test-ansible-functional.sh' (exited with code 250)

As such lets increase the memory requirements to 6GB. Moreover, we
switch to the Bento boxes which come with 65GB of diskspace and they are
all built from a central place. Hopefully, this will bring some
uniformity across the Vagrant VMs. This also removes the
openSUSE Leap 42.2 configuration since it's reached EOL.

In order to make manila-ui python3 compatible,
this patch set:
- replace dict.iteritems() with six.iteritems(dict)
- replace print msg with print(msg)
- replace dict.viewkeys() with error.keys()
- python 3 getting the keys() of a dict returns
  a dict_keys object instead of a list and hence
  sort() fails
- in python 2.x calling keys makes a copy of the key
  that you can iterate over while modifying the dict.
  This doesn't work in python 3.x because keys
  returns an iterator instead of a list.
  Another way is to use list to force a copy of the keys
  to be made.
- use getattr instead of relying on overriden __getattr__
  in the client to get params that not neccesarily need to
  be available (share_group_id and supports_share_migration)
- refactor ShareGroupTypeTests

Plus, enable py35 and py35dj20 jobs in tox and drop
old oslo-incubator files (install_venv.py)

Also add openstack-tox-py35 job to check python3 env.
openstack-tox-py35 should be defined in project-config later
but it is added to check python3 UT status.
