For some reason that isn't entirely clear to me, the attempt to update
instance metadata in _instance_update() results in a stale sqlalchemy
object state. This is a similar issue to the one fixed in commit:

  9fdf7552779d518af9cda4e366bf81fddb0cb6f2

For some reason, session.refresh() doesn't work for instance['metadata']
in the same way, which also raises suspicion that perhaps it's not the
right fix for system_metadata either.

This patch adds an _instance_update_metadata_in_place() method that
updates the actual instance['metadata'] list _and_ the database,
mirroring the high-level behavior of instance_metadata_update(), but
without requiring us to refresh or re-fetch the metadata or the
whole instance (as a workaround).

Initial draft to support multiple publication, for review only.

Don't want to use ""git review -D"", to involve more public
discussion.

Three components are involved: pollster, transformer and publisher.

Pollster will collect raw data from sources like nova etc, and then
feed that information into transformer, which act as a bridge between
pollster and publisher.

The transformer will translate the raw data into publisher-specific
counter, like metering data for billing or metric for CW. Each transformer
can support multiple pollster input, and also output to multiple publisher.

Publisher will send the counter out with publisher specific conduits.

This will also make interaction with nova simple, we can potentially use
one pollster to get all information from nova, with one API, and different
transfomer will handle Disk, CPU, memory etc. And admin can disable the
transfomers through configure files.

Several thing ahead if this method is ok:
a) change the libvirt pollster, to provide more raw data. For example,
   currently DiskIOPollster will caculate all disk access, however, this
   aggregation can be done in transfomer, while pollster can pass per-disk IO
   access information as is.
b) Remove ceilometer/publish.py
c) Change the notification also if needed
d) Add config optioin to transformer, so that it can decide publishers that
   should be disabled.

Updates the Nova conductor so that it uses instance_get_all()
and instance_get_all_by_host() from the Nova DB API to
implement its own like named functions.

This fixes a regression that occured in d22b0ca where we switched
from using the DB API's instance_get_all_by_host and instance_get_all
methods over to the DB APIs instance_get_all_by_filters.

This caused some subtle regressions due to the fact that
instance_get_all_by_filters has different defaults for
deleted records.

The previously used (prior to d22b0ca) instance_get_all() and
instance_get_all_by_host() functions rely on the context.read_deleted
and also handle the display of deleted and soft deleted records differently.

When the rpc message envelope patch went in, the serialization done in
impl_zmq was replaced with what is done in rpc.common.  Instead, it just
needs to be done as an additional stage of serialization.  The reason is
that the amqp drivers can handle passing dicts into the messaging
libraries.  The zeromq library can not handle that, so it has to ensure
it is a string before passing it down to the library.

This patch restores the original (unmodified) _serialize() and
_deserialize() methods in impl_zmq that were removed and calls them as
appropriate.

The unit test for publish_errors=True causes logging to be spewed from
other tests because it configures the default root logger rather than
creating its own logger like other logging tests do. This makes the unit
tests completely silent again.

Also, it hooked into the rpc notifier to catch notifications when it can

This patch introduces a new base exception StoreException.  This object
has the member 'uri'.  It is subclassed by relevant storage related
exceptions.  When a StorageFull exception is thrown by a storage module
the member variable uri is checked.  If it is not None a locations is
created and passed back into the storage modules delete method for
cleanup.  Some modules do not need cleanup on error (like s3).  Those
modules simply leave the uri parameter as None when creating the
StorageFull exception.  Currently the only module that throws the
StorageFull is the file system module.

The following deficiencies existing with the current version and

1) There is only placeholder support for LDAP (Bug #1092187)
2) Domain role grants are accepted but not yet honored (Bug #1093248)
3) Token invalidation does not occur with group changes (Bug #1093493)

Previously the default test behavior was to capture stdout and stderr.
Make the new default to not capture stdout and stderr then set
.testr.conf to always capture these streams when running tests under
testr.

The motiviation behind this change is that you will want these streams
to be captured when running under testr, but when not running under
testr you may not want to capture them. An example of this would be
running `python -m testtools.run test_name` with a change to test_name
to invoke the python debugger (capturing stdout and stderr interferes
with normal debugger functionality).

Also, only invoke the test timeout by default when running under testr.
This is done for the same reason as above. When running a test under the
debugger the timeout interferes with debugging.

Update compute's init_host() to get the list of instances on this host
via the conductor service.  This removes a db read from compute.

Most of the test fixes are to ensure conductor is running anywhere that
compute is running.  The EC2 availability zones test change (from 13 to
15) is because this output includes info on each service that's running,
so running nova-conductor in this test suite added more info here.

Note that this uses the previously-added ping() call in conductor to
determine when the service is available. The compute manager pings the
conductor every ten seconds for ten attempts and then falls back to the
default configured RPC timeout. This should be a reasonable compromise
between requiring strict service startup ordering and extreme delays.

This implements the capability to create usable volume clones in Cinder,
for the LVM case we create a temporary snapshot to copy from so that
volumes can remain attached during cloning.  This works by passing
in a source-volume-id to the create command (similar to create-from-snapshot).

Currently we limit clone to the same Cinder node, and only for the base LVM driver.
All other drivers should raise NotImplemented, most inherit from the SANISCSIDriver,
so move the function there and raise until we have a general implementation
for SANISCSI based drivers.

Those drivers that inherit from ISCSI directly instead of SANISCSI,
add the function explicitly and raise NotImplementedError there as well.

The previous code used a special extension loading mechanism to
selectively load the Quota model is the plugin matched and object path.
This was intended to load models required by plugins, but this loading
actually occurred after the db schema was created, so the model was not
always loaded.  This fix refactors the code to make the QuotaV2 ext
behave similarly to the other extensions ensuring the models are loaded
prior to database schema creation.

based guest configs. The only difference is that the former
uses libvirt's modern <network type='bridge'> with vport
profile specified, while the latter uses <network type='ethernet'>
and does all openvswitch setup itself. The reason for the latter
is to support running against libvirt versions older than 0.9.11

Rather than require the host admin to figure this out themselves,
merge the two classes together and automatically choose the right
impl based on the libvirt version we're running against

The LibvirtOpenVswitchVirtualPortDriver class is kept around as
a trivial subclass of LibvirtOpenVswitchDriver for backwards
compatibility. It will be removed in the Hxxx release.

This review allows periodic tasks to be enabled or disabled in the
decorator, as well as by specifying an interval which is negative.

The spacing between runs of a periodic task is now specified in
seconds, with zero meaning the default spacing which is currently 60
seconds.

There is also a new argument to the decorator which indicates if a
periodic task _needs_ to be run in the nova-compute process. There is
also a flag (run_external_periodic_tasks) which can be used to move
these periodic tasks out of the nova-compute process.

I also remove the periodic_interval flag to services, as the interval
between runs is now dynamic based on the number of seconds that a
periodic task wants to wait for its next run. For callers who want to
twiddle the sleep period (for example unit tests), there is a
create() argument periodic_interval_max which lets the period
periodic_tasks() specifies be overridden. This is not exposed as a
flag because I cannot see a use case for that. It is needed for unit
testing however.

DocImpact. Resolves bug 939087.

This introduces *EXPERIMENTAL* compute cells functionality as a way to
scale nova in a more distributed fashion without having to use complicated
technologies like DB and message queue clustering.

Cells are configured as a tree and the top level cell should contain
nova-api without any nova-computes while child cells contain everything
except nova-api.  One can think of a cell as a normal nova deployment in
that each cell has its own DB server and message queue broker.

The top level cell keeps a subset of data about ALL instances in all
cells in its DB.  Child cells send messages to the top level cell when
instances change state.  Data in 1 child cell is not shared with another
child cell.

A new service, nova-cells, is introduced that handles communication
between cells and picking of a cell for new instances.  This service is
required for every cell.  Communication between cells is pluggable with
the only option currently implemented being communnication via RPC.

Cells scheduling is separate from host scheduling.  nova-cells first picks
a cell (currently randomly -- future patches add filtering/weighing
functionality and decisions can be based on broadcasts of
capacity/capabilities).  Once a cell has been selected and the new build
request has reached its nova-cells service, it'll be sent over to the host
scheduler in that cell and the build proceeds as it does without cells.

New config options are introduced for enabling and configuring the cells
code.  Cells is disabled by default.  All of the config options below go
under a '[cells]' section in nova.conf.  These are the options that one
may want to tweak:

enable -- Turn on cells code (default is False)
name -- Name of the current cell.
capabilities -- List of arbitrary key=value pairs defining capabilities
                of the current cell.  These are sent to parent cells,
                but aren't used in scheduling until later filter/weight
                support is added.
call_timeout -- How long to wait for replies from a calls between cells

When using cells, the compute API class must be changed in the API cell,
so that requests can be proxied via nova-cells down to the correct cell
properly.  Thus, config requirements for API cell:

--
[DEFAULT]
compute_api_class=nova.compute.cells_api.ComputeCellsAPI.
[cells]
enable=True
name=api-cell
--

Config requirements for child cell:

--
[cells]
enable=True
name=child-cell1
--

Another requirement is populating the 'cells' DB table in each cell.
Each cell needs to know about its parent and children and how to
communicate with them (message broker location, credentials, etc).

Implements blueprint nova-compute-cells

This is part of blueprint vif-plugging-improvements.

The VIF driver QuantumVIFDriver has been added. This currently supports the
following vif types: 'ovs' and 'bridge'. Adding support for '802.1qbg' and
'802.1qbh' is pretty straight forward.

The patch does the following:
1. It enables a generic Quantum VIF driver to treat the vNic according to the
   type of vNic (that is, per the vif_type)
2. In order to be backward compatible and to enable plugable vif driver the
   following configuration variables have been added:
   i. libvirt_vif_default - a default driver in the event that the 'vif_type'
      is not received from Quantum (maybe an older version of Quantum)
   ii. libvirt_vif_ovs - the class to handle OVS drivers. This is configurable
      in order to enable the user to work with diffent libvirt versions, different
      OVS implementations etc.
   iii. libvirt_vif_bridge - the class to handle standard linux bridge drivers.

When message envelopes were added for rpc messages, notifications were
explicitly left out.  This was due to the fact that notifications are
consumed outside of OpenStack.  However, notification consumers will
likely want to eventually start taking advantage of some of the features
that the envelope is a prerequisite for, such as message signing.

This patch adds a new notification driver that produces message based
notifications including the message envelope.

Related to blueprint version-rpc-messages.

This adds a ping() method to conductor, which takes a single
argument and returns it back to the caller. It also returns
the name of the current service, which is always 'conductor' in
this case. I did this because I think that a generic ping method
should do this in order to facilitate blind or broadcast pings.

the GET /v2/ API call is documented to return urls to both
wadl and pdf documents. However our call returned non working

Also fix the unit tests to actually test the output of versions.
Previously we were over stubbing the test_verions.py so it was
testing only itself, and not the output you'd actually get from
the real versions.py module.

Renamed the variables used for the expected variables to reduce
confusion about what is an expected variable vs. the variables
coming from versions.py to try to ensure we don't have cicular
always passing tests in the future.

This patch adds a single service_get_all_by() method to the
conductor, which services the following database calls:

 - service_get_all()
 - service_get_all_by_topic()
 - service_get_all_by_host()
 - service_get_by_host_and_topic()
 - service_get_all_compute_by_host()

It also makes compute/manager use conductor for this case.
The special case for the service_get_all_compute_by_host() call
is rather unfortunate, and I wonder if it might be okay to (later)
make the generic function automatically joinedload in the compute
case.

On the consumer side, each message is consumed in a separate thread
but we currently have no way of waiting for all these threads to
complete.

In BaseRpcTestCase.test_call_timeout(), we complete the thread while
there is still a message handler running on the other side. This can
mean the consumer attempting to send its reply while other tests
are running, which clearly is a bad thing.

Make the connection close() and reset() methods in the kombu and qpid
drivers wait on proxy object threads before returning to avoid this
situation.

This patch adds conductor support for instance_get_all_by_filters(),
and supports the following APIs through that method:

 - instance_get_all()
 - instance_get_all_by_host()
 - instance_get_all_by_filters()

Further, it adds support for the following APIs:

 - instance_get_all_hung_in_rebooting()
 - instance_get_active_by_window()

It also makes compute/manager use conductor for these operations, with
one exception. Currently, ComputeManager.init_host () lists all
instances associated with the host, which may happen before a conductor
service is available. This will be handled separately due to the
sequencing concerns.

 - block_device_mapping_destroy()
 - block_device_mapping_destroy_by_instance_and_device()
 - block_device_mapping_destroy_by_instance_and_volume()

Once again, this just adds a single destroy operation to the conductor's
RPC API and replicates the older interfaces in the public API. Further,
the first now takes a list of bdms to be destroyed (unlike the db
operation it mirrors) so that multiple RPC calls can be avoided for
bulk delete operations.

out of the scrollback buffer before they can even be read.

much more readable.

The tests for timeutils use some canned datetime values that include
timezones, and override the result of utcnow() with the same. This
is not correct because the real utcnow() returns naive datetime
objects, so tests that assume the contrary are incorrect.

This came about because I was unable to satisfy both the oslo unit
tests and the nova ones with the same code. That happened because
the oslo ones override utcnow() with an invalid result, and the
nova tests use the real one.

There is a nova.virt.VIFDriver class which the hypervisor
VIF drivers inherit from. None of the hypervisor subclasses
pay any attention to the API contract defined to the parent
class. Some of the hypervisors don't bother trying to use
the VIFDriver class at all (hyperv, baremetal).

It is not worth trying to make the hypervisor subclasses
follow the same API contract, since the base parent class
offers no re-usable functionality of its own. The hypervisor
base classs nova.virt.ComputeDriver also has no need for the
VIFDriver API to exist, since its integration point is the
'plug_vifs' method.

As such the nova.virt.VIFDriver class serves no purpose
other than to mislead reviewers into thinking there is a
common API where none actually exists. It should thus be
deleted

This config option was added solely for unit testing. Users would never
want to set this and its availability as a config option means that
users will wonder whether it is useful to them.

To achieve the same thing, just add a global variable to the exception
module and use stubout to set it to True so that it automatically gets
reset to False at the end of each test.

That patch allows a developer to remotely run a pydev debugger and a
glance worker process connect back to it.  Two configuration options
have been added:
    pydev_worker_debug_host <host>. Default is None
    pydev_worker_debug_port <port>. Default is 5678
The behavior is enabled if pydev_worker_debug_host is not None.  If
a pydev connection fails to be esstablished an exception is raised.

This patch will allow remote debugging as well as more seemless
debugging environments with IDEs like pycharm.

This patch adds a message envelope that includes a envelope format
version number.  This message envelope will allow us to embed
additional metadata later on, such as a signature for the message
payload.

Up to this point, we've deferred message serialization as a
responsibility of the messaging library we're using by passing it a
message as Python types and letting it deal with how to pass it over a
network.  This patch adds json serialization in the rpc layer of the
application message payload before passing the message down into the
messaging library.

There are some benefits to be gained by doing a pass at serialization
ourselves.  As an example, we occasionally hit serialization bugs that
only affect some messaging drivers.  The kombu driver has always had a
nice advantage.  It uses anyjson internally for serializing messages,
which we hook into using our jsonutils module.  When there is a problem
serializing, we automatically use to_primitive() to fix it.  This patch
allows all drivers to take advantage of this automatic message fix-up.

This also creates a convenient common hook point for messages coming in
and out of the system, regardless of the driver in use.

While this changes the base format of the messages sent between nodes,
it has been done in a backwards compatible manner.  The new message
format will not be used by default.  The idea is that all nodes will be
upgraded to a version that is capable of receiving the new format
(Grizzly) before switching it on.  We will turn it on post-Grizzly.

Implement blueprint version-rpc-messages.

Changing glance-manage to use argparse sub-parsers does result in an
incompatible change. This no longer works:

  $> glance-manage db_sync --config-file=...

because --config-file is interpreted as an argument to the db_sync
command rather than a global argument. Instead you now have to do:

  $> glance-manage --config-file=... db_sync

The incompatibility is unfortunate, but the new behaviour is pretty
standard.

blueprint nvp-provider-net

Implements the provider network extension support. The list of valid network
types has been updated to reflect the types supported by the nvp plugin.
This was necessary otherwise validation would have always failed.
Multiple logical switches might be associated with a quantum network; the
first logical switch will always have the same id as the quantum network.
Also now raises exception when port limit on overlay network is reached.

This patch also adds a check for the maximum number of ports on 'standard'
overlay networks, and performs some code refactoring for improving
maintanability. For instance the NVPCluster class has been moved into its own
module.

the following:

Unit tests for baremetal/driver.py were not functioning and were
falsely reporting success due to inheriting from the wrong class.
This lead to drift between the tests and the code over time.
I decided it was easier to re-implement tests/baremetal/test_driver.py
instead of trying to fix the drift. This gave me the chance to make
the test class easier to extend. Additional tests will be added
in the future, when I refactor driver.py:spawn().

This patch also has some minor variable name changes for baremetal/driver.py.

rest_client is NOT redriving rate limited calls for the second time.
When 413 error code is encountered for a request, it checks for the
word ""overLimit"" and ""limit"" in resp_body and resp_body[message]
respectively so as to confirm if it is a absolute-limited call.
If absolute limited call is confirmed, OverLimit exception is raised
without any re-try for request.
Then comes the check for depth < MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH, if it is true,
re-drive towards request call occurs.
But, the word ""limit"" also appears in the message of ratelimited call.
Hence it is incorrect to raise OverLimit exception without re-try when
word ""limit"" is present in the message of response.
Thus changed the word to ""exceeded"" instead of ""limit"".

Following http://wiki.openstack.org/Translations to integrate transifex
translation into ceilometer and to fix bug 1082805.

This is the ground work to enable translation jobs using transifex and
Jenkin's in ceilometer. We added the empty file
ceilometer/locale/ceilometer.pot to avoid the failure of the Jenkin'
translation-jobs because git doesn't allow empty directory to be added
into the repository.

We still need to do the following things once this patch gets accepted:

1. Make the transifex ceilometer project
(https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/ceilometer/) as part of the
openstack transifex project hub and give access to the transifex
openstack Jenkins account.

2. Add the translation-jobs into openstack/openstack-ci-puppet for
ceilometer.

3. Recheck and/or clean the LOG.foobar strings in ceilometer so that
only the useful and necessary strings would be extracted into the .pot
file.

NOTE:
1. Don't use '_' as the variable name for ""don't care"", since it clashes
with gettext module.

2. Wrap the string with the underscore function to make it ready for
translation, e.g.

  internationalized_string = _(""I'm internationalized!"")
  LOG.debug(_('I speak the language of %(language)s'), locals())

That patch allows a developer to remotely run a pydev debugger and have the
keystone-all process connect back to it.  Two command line options are
introduced:
    --pydev-debug-host <host>
    --pydev-debug-port <port>
both of the above options are required to enable this behavior.

This patch only enables this behavior when the service is started with
keystone-all.  In the future parts of this patch can be used to enable
this behavior when running in Apache.
