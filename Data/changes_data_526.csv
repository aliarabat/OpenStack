When a conductor managing a node dies abruptly mid cleaing, the
node will get stuck in the CLEANING state.

This also moves _start_service() before creating CLEANING nodes
in tests. Finally, it adds autospec to a few places where the tests
fail in a mysterious way otherwise.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

We have only opted to backport the removal of openvz image.

we're going to assume that if anyone is using this they can build a
devstack plugin.

We need to copy bagpipe-bgp root helper configuration into neutron's config, so
that neutron OVS wrapper classes find the right configuration to execute commands.

This change also tunes down the verbosity of

This change delays VPN instance startup until after the vif_plugge
call to accomodate with a dataplane driver that needs the information
from a first vif_plugged call before a route can actually be processed
(such is the case with the recently added EVPN OVS driver).

There are a few places where we mount the config drive which
is not done in a consistent manner which results in failures
for the cases where the config drive is VFAT, which makes the
device label report as CONFIG-2 and not config-2 (uppercase).

This refactors the mounting and unmounting codebase to the
same block and reuses it to ensure a consistent behaviour across
tests, also letting the tags checks pass when using VFAT for
config drives.

The Nova project has made the decision to store the entire
contents of the ""sql_connection"" field in the database, with
alterations to the host value, such that various ""cells"" database
URLs can be located using Nova's database itself as a central
registry of database URLs.

This architecture has produced several problems.   The first
is that it is impossible to apply parameters to the URL that
are local to the client machine; the leading example of this
is the MySQL ""bind_host"" variable, which must match the hostname
of the connecting host.  Because cells puts these URLs into the
database and shares them with all controllers, we have to use a workaround
with the read_default_file parameter to specify a controller-local
file of options; this is not a standard thing
for other database drivers, and these parameters only apply to
the MySQL driver and not the SQLAlchemy engine.

The next issue is that it is inconvenient to add parameters
to the URL at all, once Nova has already been running, as one
must manually use Nova's command line tools
to alter all the URLs that have already been copied into the database
and alter the query parameters with each of those individually,
and then restart *all* services who will all receive the parameter
(no way to add params to just one controller).

Nova's ""store the URL in the database"" feature only needs to be able
to locate the host / database name of the alternate database,
and not change the URL tuning parameters.   This patch adds a new
oslo.db parameter connection_parameters which allows the params to
be applied separately from the sql_connection parameter, so that
Nova can continue persisting sql_connection but the parameters remain
local to the nova.conf file.   A URL parameter that truly had to remain
persisted in Nova's database (there aren't any) could still be applied
at the sql_connection level.

This feature is essential not just so that we can again place
simple parameters into controller-local files like ""bind_host"", but
also to allow for configuration of SQLAlchemy features such as
plugins that do connection pool monitoring.

Due to the simplification of group vars [1], we've removed the
definition of cinder_service_region for magnum.

The magnum role has been simplified in a separate commit to remove the
dependency on this weak linki (scoping only inside its role),
still allowing it to be overriden by a deployer. (See dependant commit).

With that included, we only needed to wire the magnum_service_region
in group vars, so we wire the magnum_service_region inside the magnum
group to the standard ""service_region"" variable, which puts
everything at the same region, like all the other services are doing,
and also standardizes the configuration.

Add a parameter, SnmpdIpSubnet, which can be an IP/MASK that will be
used to secure with IPtables the source network authorized to reach
SNMP service on the host.
If SnmpdIpSubnet is left empty (default) the parameter will be set to
SnmpdNetwork.

Also change the IPtables id, 127 was used by Horizon, so let's switch
SNMP to 124. No impact on users.

When rebuilding and changing the image, we run the new image
through the scheduler to see if it's valid for the instance
on its current compute host. The API saves off the new image
ref on the instance before casting to conductor to run through
the scheduler. If the scheduler fails, the instance.image_ref was
not being rolled back, which meant a user could attempt the rebuild
with the same invalid image a second time and the API, seeing the
instance.image_ref hasn't changed (even though it's not the actual
backing image for the server), will bypass the scheduler and rebuild
the instance with that invalid image.

This fixes the issue by using the original image ref, passed from
API to conductor during rebuild, to reset the instance.image_ref
in the case of a failure.

Note that there are other things changed on the instance in the API
which this patch does not attempt to recover as that's a bigger
work item which likely involves substantial refactoring of the code.

In nova in Queens, the ironic virt driver may set instance_info.traits
to a JSON encoded list. As instance_info is already stored as a JSON
blob in the DB, this is inefficient. While this issue in the nova virt
driver is likely to be fixed in a release in the Queens series, at least
the first release of nova for Queens (17.0.0) will not contain the fix.

This change modifies the node update (PATCH) API to check for an update
to instance_info.traits, and decode the list if it is JSON encoded. An
online data migration is likely still required in Rocky to decode any
instance_info.traits updates processed prior to this change. This will
allow us to remove support for JSON encoded instance_info.traits in the
S release.

The gate-tempest-dsvm-neutron-full-ubuntu-xenial
job was renamed to tempest-full in Queens during
the zuulv3 transition.

The ceph job was renamed to
legacy-tempest-dsvm-full-devstack-plugin-ceph
during the zuulv3 transition.

Obviously this graph is going to be wrong for any
of the old job names, or results before the job
renames, but since the ceph job is non-voting
it's likely only really useful to see the results
since queens anyway.

A recently merged change [1] requires that either the SUPER privilege is
set for the Glance DB user or the option log_bin_trust_function_creators
variable is set. The latter one looks safer, thus setting it before the
Glance db_sync is executed and revoking it afterwards.

This patch enables log_bin_trust_function_creators function at step 2,
so db_sync command can work at step 3 and then disable the function at
step 4.

When a user updates from a deprecated resource type to an
equivalent-but-differently-named one (e.g. from
OS::Heat::SoftwareDeployments to OS::Heat::SoftwareDeploymentGroup), Heat
is supposed to change the type without replacing the resource as it would
normally do when a resource type changes. This was broken in convergence,
because since 45073226752c58d640ea5a59b7e532c022a4939b the new Resource
object we create during the check_resource operation (using the new type's
plugin) is no longer automatically initialised with data from the database
as resources in the legacy path are.

Move the substitution checking to the Resource.load() method, so that it
now returns an instance of the new plugin where allowed. In the actual
update_convergence() method then we need only check that the resource class
is the one we'd expect from the new template, and replace the resource if
not.

We do have a test that is designed to check that this is working, but in it
we didn't compare the physical IDs of the resource that is potentially
getting replaced, but rather the physical IDs of some other resource that
can't possibly get modified (surprise! it doesn't change).

Conflicts:
	heat/engine/resource.py

This patch is modified with respect to the one on master, since the
branch does not contain 960f626c2455b77e654aea1d79597fadb91dc894. Thus,
resource_owning_stack.defn is substituted for initial_stk_defn and
curr_stack.defn for latest_stk_defn.

It is also modified with respect to the one on stable/pike, since the
branch does not contain 764b8fb25132ac60c7760f134b78d600269ff516 or
a7376f7494b310e9367ebe5dcb43b432a4053023. Thus, resource definitions are
obtained from the Template rather than the StackDefinition.

When the keystonemiddleware is used directly in the WSGI stack of an
application, the 503 that is raised when the keystone service errors
or cannot be reached needs to identify that keystone is the service
that has failed, otherwise it appears to the client that it is the
service they are trying to access is down, which is misleading.

This addresses the problem in the most straightforward way possible:
the exception that causes the 503 is given a message including the
word ""Keystone"".

The call method in BaseAuthTokenTestCase gains an
expected_body_string kwarg. If not None, the response body (as
a six.text_type) is compared with the value.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

This is another wrinkle for bug 1404867 where we create a
volume-backed server, create an attachment on the volume which
puts the volume in 'attaching' status, and then delete the server
before it's actually created in a cell.

In this case, the _delete_while_booting code in the compute API
finds and deletes the BuildRequest before the instance was ever
created in a cell.

The bug is that _delete_while_booting in the API doesn't also
process block device mappings and unreserve/delete attachments
on the volume, which orphans the volume and can only be fixed
with admin intervention in the block storage service.

In certain cases, such as when an instance fails to be scheduled,
the volume may already have an attachment created (or the volume
has been reserved in the old flows).

This patch adds a test to check that these volume attachments
are deleted and removed once the instance has been deleted. It
also adds some functionality to allow checking when an volume
has been reserved in the Cinder fixtures.

This backported patch drops the tests for the new-attach flow
for Cinder as it does not exist in Ocata.

If an instance fails to get scheduled, it gets buried in cell0 but
none of it's block device mappings are stored.  At the API layer,
Nova reserves and creates attachments for new instances when
it gets a create request so these attachments are orphaned if the
block device mappings are not registered in the database somewhere.

all of it's block device mappings are recorded as well so they can
be later removed when the instance is deleted.

Add a configuration option, 'use_oslo_messaging', to indicate whether
to use oslo_messaging notifier. It is set to true for backwards
compatibility.
We can't use audit middleware with services like Swift, which have no
dependency on Oslo and does not work well with oslo_log. Swift uses rsyslog.
Currently, audit middleware indiscriminately chooses oslo_messaging if the
package is installed. This is problematic if Swift proxy is on the same
controller as any service which consumes oslo_messaging. With this new option,
Swift can now safely consume audit middleware by electing to use local
log notifier instead of oslo_messaging.

Without this patch, the token formatter does not have enough data to
construct a token created with an application credential. This means
that if the token cache is disabled or expired, when keystone goes to
create the token it will not find any application credential information
and will not recreate the application_credential_restricted parameter in
the token data. This patch creates a new Payload class for application
credentials so that the application credential ID is properly persisted
in the msgpack'd payload. It also adds more data to the token data
object so that the application credential ID and name as well as its
restricted status is available when the token is queried.

When creating a snapshot of a volume-backed instance, we
create a snapshot of every volume BDM associated with the
instance. The default volume snapshot limit is 10, so if
you have a volume-backed instance with several volumes attached
and snapshot it a few times, you're likely to fail the
volume snapshot at some point with an OverLimit error from
Cinder. This can lead to orphaned volume snapshots in Cinder
that the user then has to cleanup.

This change makes the snapshot operation a bit more robust by
first checking the quota limit and current usage for the given
project before attempting to create any volume snapshots.

It's not fail-safe since we could still fail with racing snapshot
requests for the same project, but it's a simple improvement to
avoid this issue in the general case.

The debug logs are displaying unsanitized user data and could
result in people unintentionally sharing secrets. The method
""_http_log_response"" logs data without masking.

There were four solutions discussed to solve this issue on
bug-1638978 and on ML thread [1]. The last 3 solutions have
dependency on oslo.utils which is not acceptable as discussed
on bug comment [2].

This patch implements solution 1)
Carry a copy of mask_password() method to keystoneauth from oslo_utils.

NOTE:
* This patch also copies all the related code to mask_password() method
  from oslo_utils. For ex., ""_SANITIZE_KEYS"".
* keystoneauth will have to keep the version of mask_password() method
  sync with oslo_utils version. If there are any new ""_SANITIZE_KEYS""
  added to oslo_utils mask_password then those should be added in
  keystoneauth mask_password also.

  - glance_store

The job has been non-voting since January 2017:

  I34406a4d5e09d4d6d712764c278cecc159e596e3

There was talk at the Pike PTG in February 2017 about
whitelisting what was run in the test so we could decrease
the concurrency of the tests that are run in the hopes of
increasing the stability, but the person that was going
to work on that is no longer involved and the job is basically
not maintained.

Also, looking at graphite data over the last 3 months it's
nearly 100% fail so at this point running it in check even
though it's non-voting is just wasting time and resources
until someone cares about fixing this job.

When configdrive is too large, a node object cannot be saved to DB. If
it happens, the node cannot moved to DEPLOYFAIL because saving the node
is prevented again by the large configdrive in the object. In this
case, the node gets stuck in DEPLOYING, which doesn't allow any state
transition.

This patch removes the configdrive from a node object when storing the
configdrive fails. This also catches ConfigInvalid exception, which is
mentioned in the docsting, and any unexpected exception from
_store_configdrive() to avoid getting a node stuck in DEPLOYING.

The cleave() and misplaced_objects() both move objects between
brokers, so try to make them as similar as possible:

- use a common object iterator to get objects from source shard ranges
- represent queries using ShardRange's rather than dicts

Also, in misplaced_object():

- make some inline functions first class for clarity and dedent
- don't replicate a shard broker until all objects have been merged to it
- fix a couple of bugs when container listing limit was less than or equal
  to the number of misplaced objects in a shard range
  (before, if objects destined for the same shard range spanned two calls
  to get_objects then the remaining source object(s) in that shard range
  would be deleted before recursing to get_objects again!)
- check that misplaced objects really are misplaced before moving
- log aggregated warning about misplaced objects that could not be
  moved rather than one warning per object

During the migration from mox to mock, it turns out there is case where
some method is called multiple times with same parameters and
it is common in openstack dashboard tests.

This commit adds assert_mock_multiple_calls_with_same_arguments assertion
method to ensure to check both call_count and arguments of all calls.

Note that assert_has_calls just checks a subset of called arguments
so it is better to check arguments of all calls.

This changes adds short sections in past specifications to
refer to all references.

Why ?

The main motivation is that our docs jobs currently fails:
we have warning-is-error =1 and recent Spinx have a warning on
unused references, and despite the fact that requirements.txt
mandates sphinx <1.6.1, for some reason this is not honored in
CI jobs.

The second reason is that it seems to makes sense to try to support
recent sphinx releases.

The variable host_need_pip is currently used to be selective
about when pip is installed on the target hosts/containers.

This is an unnecessary precaution given that if the repo
container is not yet up, there is already a mechanism in place
to detect this and override the constraint and get-pip script
URL. By using this mechanism we get pip installed very early
and pip's configuration is still correctly constrained.

This patch ensures that this very same mechanism is used across
the board instead of using two different mechanisms, thereby
simplifying the approach.

This patch consumes it by removing the rehomed code from neutron-lib

In addition this patch makes the disable_extension_by_config private.
No consumers are using it today and if necessary they can implement
it in their own project to propose a shared version to lib.

One of the steps when we create a new stable branch is to
branch devstack, then update the default branch for most
repos to use the new stable branch for each repo.

This requires making multiple updates throughout stackrc,
and to further complicate things, there are some repo
branch variables for branchless repos that should not be
updated along with the others.

This can be error prone if not fully aware of these
exceptions. To simplify this process a little, this
patch adds two common variables - one that can be set to
the new stable branch name for all of the repos that
should be branched, and one that can be used for all of
the branchless repos to make it explicit that those
values should be left alone. The cycle-trailing repos
have until two weeks after final release to branch, so
also adding another variable for those to make it easy
to update them at a later time, separately from the
other repos.

Per the discussion in [1], the ironic nodes added to the node cache in
the ironic virt driver may be missing the required field resource_class,
as this field is not in _NODE_FIELDS. In practice, this is typically
not an issue (possibly never), as the normal code path uses a
detailed list to sync all ironic nodes, which contain all fields
(including resource_class). However, some code paths use a single
node query with the fields limited to _NODE_FIELDS, so could result in a
node in the cache without a resource_class.

This change adds resource_class to _NODE_FIELDS.

Without this patch, the token formatter does not have enough data to
construct a token created with an application credential. This means
that if the token cache is disabled or expired, when keystone goes to
create the token it will not find any application credential information
and will not recreate the application_credential_restricted parameter in
the token data. This patch creates a new Payload class for application
credentials so that the application credential ID is properly persisted
in the msgpack'd payload. It also adds more data to the token data
object so that the application credential ID and name as well as its
restricted status is available when the token is queried.

Previously, given a GET request like ""Range: bytes=-12345"" for a
zero-byte object, Swift would return a 206 response with the header
""Content-Range: bytes 0--1/0"". This is clearly incorrect. Now Swift
returns a 200 with the whole (zero-byte) object.

When running a stack update, puppetlabs-firewall will execute:

  service iptables save

Which will export all running iptables rules into
/etc/sysconfig/iptables to make the rules consistent.

We don't want Neutron-managed rules to be consistent, so we need to
remove them from /etc/sysconfig/iptables so if iptables is restarted,
it won't fail because of some missing namespaces managed by Neutron.

The current code path for detecting if keystone was deployed uses the
overcloud's credentials. This is not correct, as the output will
probably not be available there (unless you deployed a stack with a
similar output... but that would be quite a coincidence). So, this moves
the sourcing of the overcloud's credentials after getting the stack
output.

When defining a resource_registry for a composable service, the workflow fails
because it validates before the user-environment is added.
This patch moves the workflow invocation after the creation of the user-
environment.
This is caused by https://review.openstack.org/#/c/511249/ which changes the
behaviour of the action in tripleo-common.

We have a centrally defined test case base class that handles a set of

We also had a split base test case, with some things using TestCase and
some using RequestsMockTestCase. This was a holdover from the transition
to requests-mock. We are finally at the point where we don't need the
split, so merge TestCase and RequestsMockTest case.

Then, update all of the tests to use the new combined base class.

Also, replace a use of unittest.skipTest with self.skipTest from the
base class.

b) Fixed liveness and readiness probe for postgresql

Use a utility container for ipcalc on all platforms; this avoids
having to find the package on platforms where it's not easily
available and we avoid argument differences.

In certain cases, such as when an instance fails to be scheduled,
the volume may already have an attachment created (or the volume
has been reserved in the old flows).

This patch adds a test to check that these volume attachments
are deleted and removed once the instance has been deleted. It
also adds some functionality to allow checking when an volume
has been reserved in the Cinder fixtures.

If an instance fails to get scheduled, it gets buried in cell0 but
none of it's block device mappings are stored.  At the API layer,
Nova reserves and creates attachments for new instances when
it gets a create request so these attachments are orphaned if the
block device mappings are not registered in the database somewhere.

This patch makes sure that if an instance is being buried in cell0,
all of it's block device mappings are recorded as well so they can
be later removed when the instance is deleted.

Due to the simplification of group vars [1], we've removed the
definition of cinder_service_region for magnum.

We could put cinder_service_region in all group vars instead,
but it looks like the scoping is done wrong.
We should instead rely on save defaults on the role, that can
be overriden.

Here, we introduce the variable magnum_cinder_service_region,
which defaults to magnum_service_region, i.e. ""RegionOne"".

We can remove the need for an override that way, and properly
scope variables.

This patch adds an exception catch to ""snapshot_volume_backed()"" of
compute/api.py that catches (at the moment) _all_ exceptions from the
underlying cinderclient. Previously, if the instance is quiesced ( frozen
filesystem ) then the exception will break execution of the function,
skipping the needed unquiesce, and leave the instance in a frozen state.

Now, the exception catch will unquiesce the instance if it was prior to
the failure.

Got a unit test in place with the help of Matt Riedemann.
