Metadata support for NSXv distributed routers is provided via DHCP Edge
appliances. In order to avoid conflicts between distributed routers and
DHCP Edges which map different networks with same CIDRs, we create a 1:1
mapping between an distributed router and a DHCP Edge.

This patch contains the data model for the above, while the implementation
is in vmware-nsx repository.

Current API deletes quota usage and reservations on quota limit
deletion.

According to API documentation what should only happen is that quotas
limits revert to default values by deleting tenant/user limits.

This patch fixes this issue.

APIImpact: Delete on os-quota-sets will no longer remove usage and
           reservation quotas. Those quotas are handled by Cinder
           service.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

There are situations in gate tests where /dev/sdX devices are created and
deleted and the result is that we hit situations where LVM tries
to open up devices to check them even if they've been removed.  The
result is we have a blocking open call from LVM that takes approx
60 seconds to time out and fail.

Ubuntu won't have a version of lvmetad until Vivid, so for now
that just leaves the global_filter as an option.

This patch adds the filter routine to the end of stack.sh.  We don't
want to put the routine in lib/cinder_backend/lvm like we had it because
now we have to set the global filter for all LVM commands on the system.
So we put this as one of the last steps in stack.sh and run it if Cinder
is enabled.  This way we can query PV's on the system regardless of what
other services may be running and using LVM and make sure that all of
their devices are added to the filter as well.

Also, make sure we only set this for Ubuntu as Fedora/RHEL variants
utilize lvmetad. Note this differs from the original patch made to
master as the LVM lib didn't exist in Juno.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

Don't allow tenants to use the allowed address pairs extension
when they are attaching a port to a network that does not belong
to them.

This is done because allowed address pairs can allow things like
ARP spoofing and all tenants attached to a shared network might not
implicitly trust each other.

The upgrade scripts have a *ton* of historical cruft in them. This is
a bulk clean up patch that does the following things:

 - ensures we source grenaderc before functions, we need this for
   devstack dir definitions.

 - moves xtraces until after sources to trim down irrelevant output

 - removes as many variables and library sources as possible to ensure
   that we include the minimum possible code in these scripts (for
   sanity and readability).

This skips the neutron upgrade script, much like in devstack, the
neutron code has so many extra variables it's not clear what's really
needed.

We currently have two jasmine tests, one in horizon and one in dashboard.

other. Furthermore, we should extend the sources list, not override it,
because dashboard modules depends on code in horizon.

Check_MK is a Nagios/Icinga extension that offloads work from

processes locally-installed check_mk scripts, returned by

MK_Livestatus is a module that allows fast access to the Nagios
core.  The mk_livestatus plugin is a way to convert Nagios metrics
into Monasca metrics by polling the livestatus module on a
Nagios/Icinga server.

I have added a auto-generated documentation. It is done with
Sphinx library. Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language
and docstrings as a source for automated documentation.

According to https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
I used a """""" for quotes in docstrings and made
""""""Docstring.""""""-looking one-liners and correct indentation
for multiple-liners.
Based on https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests
I moved Makefile, requirements.txt and conf.py to /doc folder.
Also I decided to make fuel-qa documentation
similar to https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html
with single table of contents.
I have added empty __init__.py files to be able to produce
documentation.
I have added sys_test.log to .gitigonre because it has
been generated at the documentation build.

To make it faster and non-conflicting I added some banal
class descriptions in order to get them in auto-generated documentation.
I decided not to fight with warnings and poor docstring descriptions
I added to make documentation less conflicting and for a faster review.
Docstring improvements and detailed code description are left for later.
For the same reasons I decied not to add docstrings to all methods.
At a places where I made poor docstrings I have added a
TODO documentation.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'

retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems

This change introduces a common create API that can be applied to every
proxy method that revolves around creating a resource. In particular,
the change applies that base method to creating a server.

The method takes the attributes to create a resource and then calls the
create method on it.

As with the other similar changes to add base proxy methods, the
duplicate verification test will be removed once this API is applied to
the rest of the service proxies.

On some setups the default encoding that will be present in the

cause errors when decoding headers in the WSGI environment.

This changes the apache config template to force the mod wsgi to use
UTF-8 thus allowing werkzeug to properly decode URIs which are

This commit adds a percent change to the duration on individual test

of a testrepository times.dbm file and data in that file for the test
being run. If there is useable data subunit-trace will now use the
runtimes from there to display how the current run has changed from
the dbm file. A new threshold option is added to optionally specify a
minimum percent change to be used to determine whether to display the

On CentOS 6.x the rpm executable is in /bin instead of /usr/bin, but
the cache-devstack element ends up running yum if it wants to
download RPM packages anyway. Look for yum instead of rpm as an

Commit fa18656 fixed this in cache_devstack.py for snapshot images,

A lot of fixes to be compatible with python 3:
- fix encoding/decoding errors
- fix issues with comparison
- use `reload`, `reraise`, ext. modules from six
- use items() instead of iteritems()
- add a new file with py3 specific test requirements
- drop passing the arbitrary arguments to object.__new__ method.
  See bug [1] for more details.
- add a workaround to bug in `mock` library
- add py33 and py34 test environment to tox.ini

The method takes either a resource or an ID and calls update on the

Currently neutron resets enable_snat attribute to True when enable_snat
is not provided in router external_gateway_info. But in some deployments
(private/enterprise clouds) such behavior is not the expected default
one as snat/nat/floating-ips is not used (at least by default).

This change defines the option enable_snat_by_default which allows
deployers to set enable_snat default value when neutron resets it. The
option default value is True for backward compatibility.

Multi-patch set for easier chunks. This one addresses
the db cinder directory.

There have been quite a few instances found where the
i18n guidelines are not being followed. I believe this
has helped lead to some of the confusion around how to
correctly do this. Other developers see this code and
assume it is an example of the correct usage.

This patch attempts to clean up most of those violations
in the existing codebase to hopefully help avoid some of
that confusion in reviews.

Some issues address:
* Correct log translation markers for different log levels
* Passing format values as arguments to call, not preformatting
* Not forcing translation via six.text_type and others

Guidelines can be found here:
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.i18n/guidelines.html

Hacking checks will not be able to identify all violations of
the guidelines, but it could be useful for catching obvious
one such as LOG.info(""No markers!"").

The patch changes the approach of resource backup during stack
update. It stores the definition of resource that needs to be
updated in-place to backup stack(if it was not created before).

Without this functionality, InvalidTemplateReference will be thrown
every time when update-replaced resource has a reference to updated
in-place resource and stack update was failed. In this case, backup
stack has a resource that refers to not-presented another resource
and backup stack deletion generates an exception.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

On old versions of Ironic one would set the deploy kernel and deploy
ramdisk in the Flavor as extra_specs and the driver would populate
the Ironic Node with that information. But, since a deploy ramdisk is
driver dependent (the DIB ramdisk doesn't work with agent_* drivers for
example) Ironic moved to a model where these parameters are specified
when enrolling the Node (Just like the driver). We kept it working with
the Flavor's extra_specs for backward compability reasons for more than
one cycle. Now this patch is removing the Flavor's extra_spec way of
setting the deploy ramdisk and kernel from the Ironic Nova driver.

We have 2 branches in the vmtp stackforge repository: master and kloudbuster
These 2 guys need to get in sync from time to time
I need to sync kloudbuster to its parent branch (i.e. pick up the few changes
that were committed in master and commit them to kloudbuster).
When I try to push the merge commit to gerrit I get this error from gerrit:

(venv) AHOTHAN-M-V0CS:scale ahothan$ git review kloudbuster
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1)
remote: Processing changes: refs: 1, done
To ssh://ahothan@review.openstack.org:29418/stackforge/vmtp.git
 ! [remote rejected] HEAD -> refs/publish/kloudbuster (you are not allowed to upload merges)

Which shows that I do not have the permission to push a merge commit.
So I need to add that permission to the vmtp acl file for gerrit
in order to merge

I see only 2 other stackforge repos have pushMerge permission since they
also have branches to tend to. Most repost in stackforge do not need this
because they put all their eggs in the master branch.

Hope that is clear enough and waiting impatiently for +2

Sometimes, uWSGI may be shutdown for a while because of various reasons
and we should retry our requests to Nailgun and do not fall immediately.

For example, our service checker may report success to early after
Docker upgrades, because Nailgun's puppet run supervisor for a short
time (checkers get it and reports success), then start.sh stops it
(http requests to Nailgun will fail) and runs supervisor as daemon.

From the past couple of weeks the job
""check-tempest-dsvm-full-glusterfs-nv"" is failing because of two
reasons:
1. Empty provider location of 'volume from snapshot'
2. Nova/Libvirt doesn't support delete snapshot when vm is off

Look at Bug 1441050 for more details. Patch [1] closes this
Bug 1441050.

The cinder glusterfs CI job started failing recently when
test_volume_boot_pattern was enabled in tempest, before which
the CI job was running successfully.

Hence, I am proposing this patch to skip test_volume_boot_pattern
for GlusterFS CI job, until Nova/Libvirt issue is fixed.

This patch creates a new job template
""check-tempest-dsvm-full-glusterfs{branch-designator}"" for glusterfs
specific jobs.

The HOT-to-MuranoPL converter did not support some types for Heat
Template's input parameters.
Type 'comma_delimited_list' was not supported at all which was leading
to unhandled exceptions during package import operation.
Type 'json' was suported, but the generated UI definition did not
contain 'type' attribute for appropriate field, which was leading to
unhadled exceptions when the UI form was about to be displayed.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

W/o this fix, the timeout command is used with rabbitmqctl
wrapper, which uses a 'su' when invoked as not a rabbitmq user.
This is an issue as the 'su' changes the original
process group. And if the timeout command expired, it would kill
only processes in this original process group, leaving orphaned
commands what do not belong to whis group anymore.

The solution is to issue all timeout wrapped rabbitmqctl commands
as the rabbitmq user in the OCF script.

There are some conductor api methods left unused that can be removed
together with two very old manager methods that were deprecated and
scheduled for removal with the rpc api version bump to 2.0.

This change removes the following unused api client methods:

 - instance_get_all_by_host()
 - instance_get_all_by_host_and_node()
 - migration_get_in_progress_by_host_and_node()
 - aggregate_metadata_get_by_host()
 - block_device_mapping_create()
 - block_device_mapping_update()
 - block_device_mapping_update_or_create()
 - block_device_mapping_get_all_by_instance()
 - compute_node_update()
 - compute_node_delete()
 - security_groups_trigger_handler()

Furthermore, it removes these previously deprecated manager methods:

 - ping()
 - instance_get_active_by_window()

Manager methods that are deprecated and scheduled for removal on the
next rpc version bump are annotated with a todo comment if not there
already.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

Adds a new build-images python script which can be used to build
multiple DIB images at once using a YAML (or JSON) config file.

The YAML configuration format looks like this:
  disk_images:
    -
       imagename: overcloud-compute
       arch: amd64
       type: qcow2
       elements:
         - overcloud-compute
       packages:
         - vim
       options:

The motivation for this script is to be able to use it
as a replacement for the growing number of environment
variables required to get devtest_overcloud.sh working
in all environments.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

While this should be backported this purpose of this commit
is to unblock gating and provide for the always changing
requirements within tempest while also allowing us to ensure
that we are defcore complaint.

Tempest is not an integrated service within OpenStack and does
not adhere to any given package or requirement set that would
in a real work function with the rest of OpenStack. Because
tempest is intended to be a standalone system that is not
installed along side of the rest of OpenStack it general will
break and or introduce new requirements that break the services
that depend on various versions of packages as found within
global requirements. To fix this issue tempest is now being
installed within a VENV. The virtual environment will ensure
that tempest is installed in a location where it can resolve
its own dependencies without general impact to the rest of the
system.

Additionally, we removed the heat_contrib_extraroute heat
plugin from the build process because its presently
incompatible with PBR >= 0.11.0 which is related to issue
https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1450733 .
However we have already built wheels in our repo which will
still allow this contributing plugin to be installed as an
integrated part of the system. Currently, we git clone heat
source onto heat_engine containers and install selected plugins
via a 'python setup.py install'.  This change removes the tasks
that do that and simply adds heat-contrib-extraroute
to heat_pip_packages so it gets installed on all heat-related
containers.  This is actually only required on the heat_engine
containers but the package is tiny and should not cause any issues
being present on the heat_api containers.

Conflict Resolution Notes:
cherry-pick needed to have the old body of the complete: function
manually removed - it wasn't sure if it still belonged (resulting in
nearly duplicate code) or should be removed. I'm a bit surprised the
cherry-pick didn't auto-resolve.

service.py had some code where the child process would catch the
SIGTERM from the parent just so it could exit with 1 status rather
than with an indication that it exited due to SIGTERM. When
shutting down the parent doesn't care in what way the child ended,
only that they're all gone, so this code is unnecessary.

Also, for some reason this caused the child to never exit while
there was an open connection from a client. Probably something
with eventlet and signal handling.

VPNaaS is not working with IPv6 addresses.

1)ipsec doesn't need nat rule for ipv6. So not adding this for ipv6.
This issue is applicable for openSwan, libreswan and strongswan.

The below two issues are seen only on openswan and libreswan.
No changes are required to strongswan template files to support ipv6.
2)Add 'connaddrfamily=ipv6' to ipsec.conf for whack to parse all
addresses in the config as ipv6 addresses.

3)openswan fails to process ipv6 address from %defaultroute, so
explicitly pass the gateway address as leftnexthop address.

The Issue:

Dangling mock objects in global modules (mocked members of imported
modules that never get restored) have been causing various transient
failures in the unit test suite.

The main issues posed by dangling mock objects include:
- Such object references propagate across the entire test suite. Any
caller may be hit by a non-functional or worse crippled module member
because some other (potentially totally unrelated) test case failed to
restore it.
- Dangling mock references shared across different test modules may
lead to unexpected results/behavior in multi-threaded environments. One
example could be a test case failing because a mock got called multiple
times from unrelated modules.

Such issues are likely to exhibit transient random behavior depending
on the runtime environment making them difficult to debug.

This contribution is aiming to provide a simple transparent detection
layer that would help us prevent (most of) such issues.

Solution Strategy:

We extend the 'testtools.TestCase' class currently used as the base
class of Trove unit tests with functions that attempts to detect leaked
mock objects in imported modules. The new 'trove_testtools.TestCase'
implementation basically retrieves all loaded modules and scans their
members for mock objects before and after each test case.

An outline of the procedure follows:
1. Override the setUp() method and add a cleanup call (executed after
the tearDown()) to collect mock references before and after a test case.
2. Subtract the two sets after each test case and mark it as failed if
there are any new mock references left over.

Code Impact:

The existing test classes replace 'testtools.TestCase' base class with
'trove_testtools.TestCase'.

Documentation Impact:

Added a short document on recommended mocking strategies in unit tests
to the Trove Developer Documentation.

Known Limitations:

The current implementation has a configurable recursion depth which is
the number of nested levels to examine when searching for mocks.
Higher setting will potentially uncover more dangling objects,
at the cost of increased scanning time.
We set it to 2 by default to get better coverage.
This setting will increase test runtime.

Recommended Mocking Patterns:

Mock Guide: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html

- Mocking a class or object shared across multiple test cases.
  Use the patcher pattern in conjunction with the setUp() and tearDown()
  methods [ see section 26.4.3.5. of Mock Guide ].

def setUp(self):
    super(CouchbaseBackupTests, self).setUp()
    self.exe_timeout_patch = patch.object(utils, 'execute_with_timeout')

def test_case(self):
    # This line can be moved to the setUp() method if the mock object
    # is not needed.
    mock_object = self.exe_timeout_patch.start()

def tearDown(self):
    super(CouchbaseBackupTests, self).tearDown()
    self.exe_timeout_patch.stop()

Note also: patch.stopall()
Stop all active patches. Only stops patches started with start.

- Mocking a class or object for a single entire test case.
  Use the decorator pattern.

@patch.object(utils, 'execute_with_timeout')
@patch.object(os, 'popen')
def test_case(self, popen_mock, execute_with_timeout_mock):
    pass

@patch.multiple(utils, execute_with_timeout=DEFAULT,
                generate_random_password=MagicMock(return_value=1))
def test_case(self, generate_random_password, execute_with_timeout):
    pass

- Mocking a class or object for a smaller scope within one test case.
  Use the context manager pattern.

def test_case(self):
    # Some code using real implementation of 'generate_random_password'.
    with patch.object(utils, 'generate_random_password') as pwd_mock:
        # Using the mocked implementation of 'generate_random_password'.
    # Again code using the actual implementation of the method.

def test_case(self):
    with patch.multiple(utils, execute_with_timeout_mock=DEFAULT,
                        generate_random_password=MagicMock(
                                return_value=1)) as mocks:
        password_mock = mocks['generate_random_password']
        execute_mock = mocks['execute_with_timeout_mock']

This commit changes the location that the Bandit config file,
bandit.yaml, is stored and how it is packaged.  Previously, the
config file was listed as a data_file which is supposed to be
outside of the Bandit installed package.  This meant that
depending on the system it might be installed in different places
(/etc, or /usr/lcoal/etc, for example).  When Bandit was installed
in a virutal environment the installed location would change once
again.  Another disadvantage to this approach is that installing
Bandit might require sudo, and Bandit might not clean up its
config properly.

This commit changes the packaging so that bandit.yaml is always
installed in bandit/config/bandit.yaml.  If there is a bandit
config file in the current directory or the user's home directory,
these are still preferred.
