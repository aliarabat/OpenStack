The unit tests around instance multiple create were faking out the uuid
of the created instances to be aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa.
This worked because the instances are not actually created in the
database so unique constraints aren't violated.

However this led to mocking out the create for the RequestSpec object
which should not have been necessary because there is a database
available to these tests. That would have been fine except that there is
work in progress which relies on the RequestSpec having been written to
the database and getting that to pass tests was starting to rely on
mocks upon mocks upon mocks. Rather than go down that route this unwinds
the test strategy that requires the mocks in the first place.

This patch adds a feature to specify Cinder volume type
via cinder_img_volume_type parameter in glance image metadata.

In some cases, between image and hypervisor, storage backend
are tightly connected in each other. For example, if users
want to boot a VMware instance from an image, this image has
to be configured some VMware specific parameters in previous,
and then Nova can deploy an instance on to proper hypervisor
based on the image metadata properties.

Currently, Cinder handles few image metadata properties but
volume type is not included. If volume type can be retrieved
from image metadata which is configured by cloud admin, user
doesn't need to care volume type and also storage backends.
And then appropriate volume type will be chosen automatically
based on the information of cinder_img_volume_type in the
image metadata during volume creation.

If user has enough knowledge about image, hypervisor and
storage backend, user also can specify 'volume_type' via
CLI or API as in the past.
Priority of volume type related parameters are shown below.

1. volume_type             (via API or CLI)
2. cinder_img_volume_type  (via glance image metadata)
3. default_volume_type     (via cinder.conf)

DocImpact: Add usage of this parameter to 'Manage volumes'

The method delete_project_assignments() in assignment backend removes
all assignments for a project - although the code fails to set the type
of assignment, and just uses target_id. This patch sets the type of
assignment (i.e. USER_PROJECT or GROUP_PROJECT) in order to avoid wrong
deletions when domain_id == project_id.

The AuthContextMiddleware shouldn't be re-implementing the

This makes it so that admin token handling is in one place

implementation of the admin token middleware.

The old behavior is left in place as deprecated to be removed
in a future release.

 - The paste.ini file is changed to put the admin token

When an ipv6 auto_address subnet is added to an existing network with IPv4
subnet, the dhcp port in the network is simply updated with an IPv6 address.
However, neutron does not send any port_update notification for the dhcp
port. This causes inconsistencies (while configuring anti-spoofing rules)
for external controllers (like OpenDaylight) as the dhcp port info
in controller does not match with the dhcp port info in Neutron db.
This patch addressess this issue by having the plugin send a port_update
call when the dhcp port is updated with IPv6 auto address.

When routes are added to a router without a gateway the

With keyword arguments for notification callbacks, there can be conflicts
with naming and the positional arguments used. The signature for notify()
is:

    def notify(self, resource, event, trigger, **kwargs)

So, for example, if we call notify as follows:

    registry.notify('foo', 'bar', 'trig', port=2, event=5)

We'll get an error of multiple values for keyword argument 'event'.

To avoid this, the approach taken in this commit is to use a dict for
the parameters to pass to the callback, in the same way that the
Requests package does for get().

There are two other changes in this patchset. First, there is a bug
in the callback mechanism, where a create notification that encounters
an exception, will call the abort callback, but does not pass in the
kwargs (or params dict in this case).  It may be useful for the abort
callback to have this information. (I can cherry pick this to Neutron).

Second, since the UT's secondary purpose is to act as documentation,
showing developers how to use the feature, I changed arguments from
mock.ANY to something more descriptive to better show how the calls
are used.

Recently, the Horizon Dashboard project launched a new approach
for loading dashboard panels at startup, and along with that, a
new 4 digit numbering scheme for the files that enable that to
happen.

This patch updates the numbering of the panel enable files
from 2-4 digits and sorts them into a reasonable load order.

The nginx_port variable is insufficiently generic enough in the event
a user really wanted to run Apache, or some other web server.

As such, this commit renames the setting to file_url_port to
prevent any confusion meanwhile supporting the ability to continue to
use an override setting should the variable nginx_port be defined in

This patch aims to add puppet openstack integration jobs running on
centos7 in tempest experimental queue.

It will provide feedback when we need to test some patches in Tempest
and see if it would break Puppet OpenStack CI.

Note: why running only on centos7 and not ubuntu? Because centos7 jobs
are deploying RDO packaging which is very recent and will catch more
bugs than Ubuntu UCA packaging (much older). So it's not useful now to
run both distros and we can save node resources here.

This is not an appropriate backport for stable branches

http://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/stable-branches.html

Specifically, this is implementing a blueprint in a stable

CORS middleware's latent configuration feature, new in 3.0.0,
allows adding headers that apply to all valid origins.
This patch adds headers commonly used in openstack to designate's
paste pipeline, so that operators do not have to be aware of
additional configuration magic to ensure that browsers can talk
to the API.

glance_store passes some unused parameters such as tenant, auth_version
and others to Multi-tenant store when initializing Swift connection.
The patch removes these parameters from the Connection __init__
method because glance_store doesn't need to pass them - it passes
a valid auth_token to Swift connection (so it doesn't need to
initialize Keystone client and request the token).

Improvements for charts that related to scenario output:

  * X-axis label can be specified to add_output() by
    ""axis_label"" key of chart options dict.
    The key is named ""axis_label"" but not ""x_label""
    because chart can be displayed as table, so we explicitly
    mention ""axis"" in option name to make this parameter
    useless for tables

  * Y-axis label can be specified to add_output() by
    ""label"" key of chart options dict.
    In some cases this parameter can be used for rendering
    tables - it becomes column name in case if chart with
    single iteration is transformed into table

  * As mentiones above, if we have output chart
    with single iteration, then it is transformed to table,
    because chart with single value is useless

  * OutputLinesChart is added, it is displayed by
    NVD3 lineChart()

  * Chart ""description"" is optional now. Description is
    not shown if it is not specified explicitly

  * Scenario Dummy.add_output is improved to display labels
    and OutputLinesChart

  * Fix: If Y-values are too long and overlaps chart box,
    then JavaScript updates chart width in runtime to fit
    width of chart graphs + Y values to their DOM container

With the creation of the new openstack_config provider, some
essing
that was done in zaqar_config has been centralized in
openstack_config.

Impacted methods are :

  * section
  * setting
  * separator

Also, this commit adds the fact that, when passing a specific string
(ensure_absent_val) the provider will behave as if ensure => absent
was
specified. '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' is the default value for
ensure_absent_val.

The use case is the following :

zaqar_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => 'bar' } # will work as
l

zaqar_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' } #
 mean absent

That means that all the current :

if $myvar {
  zaqar_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => $myvar }
} else {
  zaqar_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : ensure => absent }
}

can be removed in favor of :

zaqar_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => $myvar }

If for any reason '<SERVICE DEFAULT>' turns out to be a valid value
for a specific parameter. One could by pass that doing the following

zaqar_config { 'DEFAULT/foo' : value => '<SERVICE DEFAULT>',
 ensure_absent_val => 'foo' }

It is important to remove these tests for a number of
reasons:

a) the fwaas team is working on a new version of the
   API; testing the old API is clearly not gonna be
   useful.
b) changes to the neutron_fwaas repo can unexpectedly
   break Neutron, forcing us to co-gate on a fwaas
   fix to solve the empasse.

The FWaaS team should pursue a decoupled testing
strategy, where these types of tests are used to gate
on the fwaas repo itself. As a temporary measure a
co-gate to neutron would be acceptable (like lbaas)
until neutron-lib takes proper life.

This change will allow users (or ironic-inspector) to provide
several possible profiles for a node by setting capabilities like
XXX_profile (where XXX = compute, controller...).

Two new commands are added:

 openstack overcloud profiles match

    When no enough nodes with a given profile are found, this command
    will inspect nodes with such capabilities and choose missing nodes
    from them.

 openstack overcloud profiles list

    Lists all available and active nodes with their profiles and possible
    profiles.

See the following thread for the full background:
http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-November/078884.html

This changes refactores profile validation code in the deploy command to use
the same logic as commands above. It's worth noting that this change also
removes an incorrect assumption that a node can have multiple values
for the same capability. It also makes sure we only take active and available
nodes into account for all calculations.

The use of ansible.cfg is removed as there is no way of being

use of environment variables which make use of tox's default

This patch updates the tox.ini the same bashate exceptions as are
currently in the OpenStack-Ansible playbook repo.

It also ensures that the linters and all lint targets work
appropriately and normalises the tox.ini configuration to use
uniform formatting.

The use of ansible.cfg is removed as there is no way of being
certain which paths can be used without reverting to an ugly
sed hack in the commands. This is why it is preferred to make
use of environment variables which make use of tox's default
substitutions instead. It's a more reliable way of achieving
the goal for the purpose of gating and testing.

The switch to using a git clone instead of ansible-galaxy to
download the plugins is due to the path spec not being able to
work in Ansible 2.x. [1]

exception to the policy engine for when items disappeared during policy

This patch adds the decorators to the two methods to catch any
retry exception that may be emitted from the policy engine or

DHCP agent will report an error when enable configuration

For example, if this configuration is set to '/tmp'.
The code checks dir '/tmp' if exists. This is wrong.
The right way is to check '/tmp + [network_id]' existence.

Introducing a new library to retrieve information from libosinfo database.

Libosinfo database provides information about an optimal hardware configuration
for the guest instances, based on their Operating Systems.
Using this library it will be easier for the end user to boot a guest instance
with an optimal configuration by just providing the guest's OS name.

The following are the acceptable attributes:

 * 'short-id' - the short name of the OS
    eg fedora21, winxp

 * 'id' - the unique URI identifier of the OS
    eg http://fedoraproject.org/fedora/21, http://microsoft.com/win/xp

However, it is difficult to handle them because of python get() which
returns None if a key doesn't exist.
For denying None parameters on the API, this patch adds jsonschema
validation to the API.

This patch updates the tox.ini the same bashate exceptions as are
currently in the OpenStack-Ansible playbook repo.

It also ensures that the linters and all lint targets work
appropriately and normalises the tox.ini configuration to use
uniform formatting.

The use of ansible.cfg is removed as there is no way of being
certain which paths can be used without reverting to an ugly
sed hack in the commands. This is why it is preferred to make
use of environment variables which make use of tox's default
substitutions instead. It's a more reliable way of achieving
the goal for the purpose of gating and testing.

The switch to using a git clone instead of ansible-galaxy to
download the plugins is due to the path spec not being able to
work in Ansible 2.x. [1]

Now that we're using a Fedora image, it appears to take longer to
spawn the VM on some jobs.  One that failed took 167 seconds just
to start the instance, which is uncomfortably close to our timeout

to have worked correctly, so it probably would have passed otherwise.

Bumping the timeout to 360 to match the ping timeout.  In

On Linux ohai gets the block device size from /sys/block/$device/size.
That size is always measured in units of 512 bytes even if the ""physical""
block size of the device in question is different [1][2]. On the other hand
/sys/block/$device/queue/logical_block_size is the smallest unit which
the device can address, and /sys/block/$device/queue/physical_block_size
is the smallest unit the physical storage device can write atomically.
Typically SATA/SAS drives having the size >= 2 TB have 4 KB physical
sectors and expose 512 ""logical"" block size to the operating system.
However some hard drives (for instance, HGST Ultrastar 7K6000 SAS drive)
expose the actual physical sector size (that is, 4 KB) for the efficiency
reasons. As a result nailgun-agent miscomputes the size of the hard drive
(it's 8x off!)

for multiple keys to be stored as a set. When the config_template
encounters a set type it will process and reder value as a

Set types are defined in yaml via the ""?"" entry.

This patch configures glance to use Swift as the default
backend for image storage. The 'file' backend is
still available (listed in known stores) so that users
who upgrade will still have access to those images.

The motivation for this change is to be able to load
images directly from Swift into the IPA deployment
ramdisk (via a swift temp URL). In the future...
say once we have support for ""external swift""
in instack undercloud one could imagine using this feature
to offload most of the image deployment traffic from
the instack deployment vm/server entirely by relying
on an external swift cluster.

'size' will automatically be defaulted to 1. That means that
aggregation will not happen as expected with a retention_time of
60 seconds.

This fix will only default sample size to 1 if neither
retention_time or size are defined.

Service plugins are a great way of adding functionality in a
cohesive way. Some plugins (e.g. network ip availability or
auto_allocate) extend the capabilities of the Neutron server
by being completely orthogonal to the core plugin, and yet may
be considered an integral part of functionality available in
any Neutron deployment. For this reason, it makes sense to
include them seamlessly in the service plugin loading process.

This patch, in particular, introduces the 'auto_allocate' service
plugin for default loading, as we'd want this feature to be enabled
for Nova to use irrespective of the chosen underlying core plugin.

The feature requires subnetpools, external_net and router, while
the first is part of the core, the others can be plugin specific
and they must be explicitly advertised. That said, they all are
features that any deployment can hardly live without.

DocImpact: The ""get-me-a-network"" feature simplifies the process
for launching an instance with basic network connectivity (via an
externally connected private tenant network).

Once leveraged by Nova, a tenant/admin is no longer required to
provision networking resources ahead of boot process in order to
successfully launch an instance.

Implements: blueprint get-me-a-network

I8287677c7ad0f13fa9f5cb194f9372d04b78cb61 changed the behavior of
DevStack, so that path_mtu is being set to 1500 by default. Let's take
the next step and set path_mtu to 1500 by default, instead of relying on
deployment tools like DevStack to set it.

When using the ML2 plugin and setting path_mtu to default to 1500,
the second order effect is that all Neutron
Network objects will have the mtu attribute populated. For tenant
network types like VXLAN, the MTU will be set as path_mtu less the
protocol overhead. So for example, a Neutron Network backed by VXLAN
will have the mtu attribute set to 1450.

Image Detail UX redesign, implemented in AngularJS.  This uses the design
at http://invis.io/962Q35HVQ as its base.  For now, basic properties are
displayed.

The actions on the detail screen will be implemented in a later patch.

To test, modify openstack_dashboard/enabled/_1051_project_ng_images_panel.py
and set DISABLED = False

There's a bug around translation of images which is introduced
by this change https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1487590

Adding a column named scale_config to the app table.
The idea is to use it to store an app's scaling related
configuration. The type of the column is set to text, so that
we can store any required information in this column.
For now, the plan is to store following info in json format:

{<app-name>: {target: m, current: n, du: du-name/du-id}}, where

app-name is the app-name

m is the number of target instances requested in the most
recent scaling operation.

n is the number of actual instances running after the most
recent scaling operation has been completed.

n <= m relation will always hold.

du-name/du-id is the name/id of the application du that
should be used in the scaling operation.

This column will also allow us to support multi-service
applications in the future. Lets say we have an app with
two services - web and backend. The scaling configuration
for both can be stored as follows.

{web: {target: w_m, current: w_n, du: w_du},
 backend: {target: b_m, current: b_n, du: b_du}
}

Tucked away in systemd-udev-settle.service is the following comment

 # This service can dynamically be pulled-in by legacy services which
 # cannot reliably cope with dynamic device configurations, and
 # wrongfully expect a populated /dev during bootup.

The info that the growroot script is querying is populated via udev,
particularly the blkid bits of [1].  This creates a race-condition
where sometimes udev has been triggered and the rules have applied and
sometimes not.  Obviously in the first case, the root disk is not
grown correctly.

systemd-udev-settle is mostly disabled on distros because it can cause
an increase in boot-time for systems with lots of disks; this is not
our situation so it makes basically no difference.

That said, I will investigate if some systemd people know even better
ways to do this (possibly the service should depend on block .device
targets in systemd, and then filter out and only apply to the root
disk?)

Based on experience using handoffs_first and feedback from other
operators it has become clear that handoffs_first is only used during
periods of problematic cluster behavior (e.g. full disks) when
replication attempts are failing to quickly drain off the partitions
from the nodes which they have been rebalanced from.

In order to focus on the most important work (getting handoff partitions
off the node) handoffs_first mode will abort the current replication
sweep before attempting any primary suffix syncing if any of the handoff
partitions were not removed for any reason - and start over with
replication of handoffs jobs as the highest priority.

Note that handoffs_first being enabled will emit a warning on start up,
even if no handoff jobs fail, because of the negative impact it can have
during normal operations by dog piling on a node that was temporarily
unavailable.

The source-repositories element attempted to prune stale branches from
the local cache repos but failed because it was fetching specific refs
instead of updating remote tracking branches. Address this by performing
an explicit `git remote update --prune` prior to other git operations,
then comparing the list of local branches to the list of remote
branches. Any branch that is present locally but not on any remote will
be deleted.

This has the side effect of fetching refs early, short circuiting much
of the ""fetch the ref we need"" code in this element. That code is left
in place as there may be corner cases where a git remote update will not
fetch the ref that we want requiring us to be more explicit.

This commit adds a generate_subunit.py script which is used to
generate a subunit stream with a single failure for a period of time.
It takes it 2 mandatory args and 1 optional to specify the start time,
stop time, and optionally the id for test (if one isn't provided
'devstack' is used) The resulting stream is written to STDOUT.

The intent here is to leverage this to inject 'test results' into the
subunit2sql db to reflect failures that occur before tempest (or any
other test suite) is run. This is necessary for the openstack-health
dashboard. (otherwise it makes our failure rate look much better than
it is) This is only needed until we get a zuul mysql reporter in place
which can give us the higher level run information.

The actual usage of the script will be addressed in a follow-up patch.

Recently, the gate jobs took too long to complete (between 2 to 8
hours). The reason is jenkins slave agent die during the test, which
cause the CI to re-start the whole test in a new VM.

The failure mainly occurred at magnum-api pipeline, but also occurred
at other pipelines. In term of distribution of test nodes, this
failure mainly occurred at OVH nodes, in which there is no dedicated
swap device. As a result, at OVH nodes, local disk is used for swap
when memory is over-consuming. It looks this leads to resource
starvation, which cause the failure.

This patch attempted to reduce the memory consumption of the gate
tests. In the api test, the number of worker nodes was reduced from
2 to 1. In all tests (api/k8s/swarm/mesos), the memory of worker node
was reduced from 1G to 512M.

just list the things these packages need directly instead of relying on

break the single-origin policy and access the API directly.

In previous patches, proper paste support for gabbi was added. This patch
modifies the paste.ini file for both aodh and gabbi, adds the CORS
configuration fixture to support unit tests, and adds CORS into configgen.

The "";python_version='2.7'"" construct in requirements.txt requires
pip>=6 before it can be parsed correctly.  tox/virtualenv will usually
create the venv with the *system* pip version, which may be too old (eg:
python-pip is 1.5.6-7 in Debian testing at time of writing).

It seems tox/pip/setup.py all lack a clean way to specify dependencies
that will be installed before setup.py is actually invoked, so this
change hacks this in using the tox.ini install_command.

(This reverts this portion of Icf33533348b8b6088abe3d4de5a84f253fe3836d,
which inadvertently(?) removed this line amongst other tox.ini cleanups)

NOTE:This patch introduces support for ZeroMQ driver for cinder single
backend case.
Multi-backend will be addressed in the next patch as part of the
blueprint.

CHANGES:ZeroMQ driver requires hostname for message delivery as there is no
broker inbetween.
So, extract the hostname and feed to the messaging client for zeromq
driver.

For the record, ZeroMq is a very lightweight distributed messaging system
specially designed for high throughput/low latency scenarios.
Addition of support for ZeroMQ would help cinder scale out with high
performance and be highly available as there is no centralised broker.

openstack-infra are creating images containing an apt.d configuration

skip the V-38462 tag.  Skipping the tag in the gate is probably the
better long term solution.

Additionally, ansible-lint 2.3.8 was released today and is now causing
a number of ANSIBLE0008 errors to fail the gate.  This is a temporary
cap to unblock the gate.

This patch refactors the pecan controllers and functional tests
by spliting the code in several modules in order to avoid excessive
growth and ensure some level of consistency as regards function
and classes defined in each module.

To this aim:
- The generic resource controllers are moved into their own module
- Other controllers, such as extension and quotas, are moved into
  their own module
- Functional tests are split into 3 modules: one for generic tests,
  one for request processing tests, and the latter for testing hooks.

Runs indexing for child plugins as part of the parent;
errors if a child plugin is specified in the 'type' list to index sync.

When a parent is indexed, it will create mappings for any detected
child plugins, and index their data. Child plugins must implement
a property 'parent_plugin_type' whose value is the resource type of
the parent; the _parent mapping field is applied automatically.

This should assist with a restriction in elasticsearch 2.x whereby
parent mappings cannot exist prior to child mappings being created.
Ordering is such that the parent will come last. It is also necessary
in Elasticsearch 2.x to assign a _routing value when indexing child
documents; this is left to a separate patch.

This patch continues work on making the connect_volume methods
more efficient. Using multipath -l to find the available multipath
devices can take a lot of time listing all of the potential
devices. Previously, the FC connector had been modified to skip
the use of multipath -l.

This patch takes the FC code and makes it into a generic method to
be used in the ISCSI connector and the FC connector and updates tests.

I also fixed argument order in assertEquals() in the
test_connect_volume_with_multipath() function.

This patch also removes the 'rbd_flatten_volume_from_snapshot'
configuration option as it is no longer necessary.

With RBD's objectmap feature, it's no longer necessary to flatten clones
as a chain of arbitrary length has no impact on performance.

There is an added benefit of being less confusing to a user.  Even
though volume deletion is asynchronous from the client's perspective,
nearly all other drivers will carry out the operation successfully.
However for RBD, a snapshot with clones would raise VolumeIsBusy() even
though the client returns success on the command line or the API.
Confusion from both users and tempest tests make this change even more
compelling.
