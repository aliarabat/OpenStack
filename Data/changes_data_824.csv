Consumer declaration consist of the next steps:
  1) declare an exchange

  3) bind the queue to the exchange

Due to reply exchanges are auto-delete, at the

After murano Objects and ObjectsCopy started merged during deployment,
destruction dependencies enabled in .init method stop working. The cause
is that now it's impossible to fetch ""old"" subscriber object to use
during garbage collection.
This problem is solved. Murano will persist destruction dependency in
target object model, and check if it exist or modified.

Also, murano have an error in sorting of must-be-destroyed objects.
Target was deleted after subscriber, and sorting failed in case of
cyclic dependencies. This is solved too.

Test for this cases are introduced in this commit.

When we add/remove router interface from HA router, l3 agent
will send SIGHUP signal to keepalived for reloading configuraion.

But for DVR+HA router, l3 agent will send SIGHUP signal TWICE which
will cause VRRP sub-process terminated and vip addresses and routes
left over. Keepalived then restart VRRP process and there will be
a re-election between VRRP peers. After the election, if the former
is still master, the state showed from Neutron will be correct. But
if the former master transitioned to backup, the new VRRP process
will NOT delete vips and routes because it is not the one who
configured them. There will be two active agent showed from Neutron.

HaRouter.enable_keepalived() will send SIGHUP signal to keepalived.
DvrEdgeHaRouter.process() should not call enable_keepalived() by
itself because it has inherited from class HaRouter.

This patch is bumping the max_retries and retry_interval when
instantiating the Ironic client to 60 seconds. This is to workaround the
NodeLocked problem that might happen to some baremetal commands.

Looking at some TripleO-CI logs it's not uncommon to see this exception
being raised when it's registering nodes in Ironic, that's because
commands like --register-nodes does also change the node's state to move
it from ""manageable"" to ""available"" which may conflict with the periodic
task in the Ironic conductor syncing the power state.

A FIXME was left in the code noting that we should use the
ironicclient.get_client() functions instead of instantiating the
Client() class directly, that's because the Client() class does not
validate any parameters.

This patch also adds a new unittest module for the actions/base.py which
is currently not unittested at all.

We don't merge common_attrs with node's custom attributes
in deployment info. But YAQL expressions still need to
access 'unified' deployment info, related to node. So
we were merging dicts every time yaql want to access it.
It's a bit slow, so this patch introduces class, which
works like union of several dicts without creation of the new
data structure.

Relying on duplicate entries for existing provisioning
block detection led to lots of log noise whenever we
would encounter a deadlock because the savepoint would
go missing. Additionally, since this would happen inside
of another transaction, we couldn't be guaranteed until
the final commit that this was unique anyway so the whole
transaction could throw a duplicate exception.

Since the outer transaction has to handle duplicate exceptions
anyway, this patch just adjusts the logic to check for the
existing of a record first with a regular query. If there
is a race the outer transaction will still fail with a duplicate
as before, but we at least won't have a bunch of missing savepoint
exception noise.

This was once implemented to allow objects that aggregate attributes
from multiple models. Specifically, that was the original design for QoS
rules, where we had a model with common attributes, and then a separate
model with rule specific attributes.

After a while, struggling to make it work without huge hacks, and after
rethinking database schema, we dropped the original design for QoS
rules, replacing it with a single model per type.

This patch cleans up the remnants of those dark ages of QoS.

This should make the code a bit more clear to readers who currently
wonder why we may have multiple database models for the same versioned
object.

History:

libvirt 1.3.3 had added perf event support for cmt, mbmt, mbml support
when we landing the spec
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/support-perf-event .

For the event cmt, mbmt, mbml, we requires that libvirt to expose some
some specify cpu features, but libvirt 2.0.0 only has that expose merged
`cpu_map.xml: add cmt/mbm feature to x86 (Qiaowei Ren)`, the capabilities
changed to:

<feature name='mbm_total'/>
<feature name='mbm_local'/>
<feature name='cmt'/>

Need to adopt this to let nova driver discover these features when
enable cmt, mbmt, mbml event.

That is to say: even libvirt 1.3.3 has support perf event, but nova
cannot get noticed since libvirt don't expose cpu features until 2.0.0.

This patch bump MIN_LIBVIRT_PERF_VERSION to 2.0.0, see:
https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsPerf

This commit adds caching on get_all_runs_time_series_by_key() which is
called from the home page requests. Recently, the home page loading time
is so long and I'm really annoyed every time. So I hope this could
reduce the time.

This call might have a high cache miss percentage because the start/stop
date, grouping, etc. parameters are changed frequently.

However, in my environment, this patch halves the loading time on
average[1]. I think this would be good when like below cases:
 1. Share a URL with parameters in case of telling others in emails,
    etherpads, and so on.
 2. Open a URL with parameters from your bookmarks.
 3. Some people access same url for an hour.
In these cases, this cache would work well.

[1] I tested this with reloading browser. It reduced 12.1 to 6.1 sec.

The flavor framework currently has a TODO where the logic
to ensure the flavor isn't in use should be. Implementing
this logic will be a bit complicated this late in the cycle
since many different services can depend on the flavor.

For now we can at least catch the DBReferenceError when trying
to delete the flavor and convert it into the FlavorInUse
exception.

This leaves some notes inline about how we might go about
implemented the _ensure_flavor_not_inuse function.

Because Gnocchi depends on Swift to exist in the service catalog
and be available when using Swift storage, the Gnocchi role must be
run after the Swift service is installed. However the Swift service
benefits from the existence of the Gnocchi roles' identity artifacts
in Keystone when it is configured.

To work around this circular dependency, a special role lifecycle
var is introduced to limit the scope of execution of the Gnocchi
role to only creating the identity artifacts so that this role can
be executed quickly and safely before Swift is installed to allow
Swift to be properly configured, and again without that variable
set after Swift is installed to perform the standard install of
Gnocchi.

No release note or special documentation is provided since this is
still targeting the first release cycle of OpenStack-Ansible with
this role and no special documentation exists for the lifecycle vars
in other services (such as galera_server).

When a compute node is reconfigured to have different inventory it
needs to be able to tell the placement service of these changes,
even if they violate existing allocations. Thus, when updating
inventory we no longer check the new capacity against existing
allocations, we just let it happen (but log a warning).

This is safe because allocations in excess of capacity will still
prevent resources from being used.

The scenario tests for clusters are occasionally failing when doing a
cluster-show after a cluster-grow. This seems to happen because the
locality flag on the new instances takes a few seconds (sometimes) to
populate. This results in a 'AssertionError: Cluster missing attribute
locality.' error in the cluster grow test.

The fix is to check all the instances for the server_group information
instead of just the first instance.

The cluster tests were also tweaked so they could be run separately.

1) Add 2GB swap by default
Add some swap when running CI jobs, so we can reduce the number of
failures in CI related to missing memory.
By default 2GB, can be disabled or increased/decreased with parameters.

2) Promote RDO repository to have Oslo DB from master
python-oslo-db 4.13.x releases are known to break Gnocchi.
https://review.openstack.org/367221 will fix it, but it is not yet
in any release, so RDO unpinned oslo.db until that happens.

3) Disable Ironic testing on Ubuntu. Packages are broken in recent
   Newton upgrade. They are working on it.

4) Enable br_netfilter kernel module on Ubuntu.
See https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-archive/+bug/1621651
Even if it's not critical, it's a nice-to-have because it removed the
ERROR that we had in neutron logs. We'll see how the bug report evolve
and maybe remove this workaround.

5) Export lsmod in logs, easier for us to debug later.

6) Disable linuxbridge on scenario003 for Ubuntu
Also see https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-archive/+bug/1621651

7) Pin Puppetlabs release package.

It has always been a weird thing that dib is a python package, but
is totally driven by the disk-image-create script.  It creates this
strange division that is hard to explain.

This moves disk-image-create to a regular python entry-point

Currently, this simply exec()s the original disk-image-create script.

However, we now have a (private) interface between disk-image-create
written in python and the driver shell script.  Here's some things we
could do, for example:

* Argument parsing is generally nicer in Python, and then end result
  is mostly just setting environment variables to flag different things
  in the shell script.  I could see us moving the argument-parsing into
  diskimage_builder.disk_image_create:main() and just setting things in
  os.environ before the exec()).

* I7092e1845942f249175933d67ab121188f3511fd sets IMAGE_ELEMENT_YAML in
  disk-image-create by calling-back to element-info.  We can just call
  element_dependencies.find_all_elements() in here an export is to
  os.environ before disk-image-create starts.

* remove need for ramdisk-image-create symlink by just exporting
  IS_RAMDISK based on sys.argv[1] value

* you could even unit test some of this :)

If the ML2 driver fails to initialize the OVS DB connections,
neutron server must be restarted before any OVN NB or SB transactions
can be processed. Effectively, the neutron server is half-dead. It is
able to process read-only requests but fails on all others. And the
error messages seen on requests and in the logs are often misleading.

This patch set adds initial OVS DB connection retry support and provides
more details on the error messages. With this patch, the neutron server
won't respond to any requests until the initial OVS DB connections can
be established. The connection attempts will be retried forever with an
exponential backoff up to a 3 minute wait between retries.

Also the retrying package was added to the requirements. It should have
been there already since it is used in ovsdb_monitor.py.

Note: OVS DB connection failures after initialization are retried
already.

As a result, the neutron-ovn-db-sync-util utility and neutron server
service startup sync won't delete ACLs on a lswitch unless the
lswitch has at least one port on it with a security group.

This patch set fixes the problem by using the neutron networks list

This PS adds cinder volume, tgtd, iscsi and cinder backup pods.
At this point only iSCSI/LVM2 backend is supported. For Cinder
to use iSCSI/LVM2 backend there are two ways to provide a backend
configuration. First - via configmap but this config will be applied
to all compute nodes running cinder-volume process (not recommended),
second - via using kolla-kubernetes,yml configurarion file. In
kolla-kubernetes.yml each compute node hosting cinder-volume process
can be confiugred with custom VG name. If kolla-kubernetes.yml is used,
cinder.conf on a compute node will have ONLY config relevant to this
node. As per Cinder developers feedback, this way, is prefered way of
configuring cinder-volume process.
IP address of the server hosting VG group as well as VG group name will
be used to dynamically generate requested backend.
See below an example. If kolla-kubernetes.yml has the following
configuration:

cinder_backends:
- lvm_backends:
  - iscsi_target_1:
     ip: ""10.57.120.14""
     vg_name: ""cinder-volumes""
  - iscsi_target_2:
     ip: ""10.57.120.13""
     vg_name: ""local-volumes""

Then compute node with ip address 10.57.120.13 will have these lines
added to its local cinder.conf:

[DEFAULT]
enabled_backends = 10.57.120.13_local-volumes

[10.57.120.13_local-volumes]
volume_group = local-volumes
volume_backend_name = 10.57.120.13_local-volumes
volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.lvm.LVMVolumeDriver
iscsi_helper = tgtadm
iscsi_protocol = iscsi

And compute node with ip address 10.57.120.14 will have its own
configuration in its local cinder.conf:

[DEFAULT]
enabled_backends = 10.57.120.14_cinder-volumes

[10.57.120.14_cinder-volumes]
volume_group = cinder-volumes
volume_backend_name = 10.57.120.14_cinder-volumes
olume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.lvm.LVMVolumeDriver
scsi_helper = tgtadm
iscsi_protocol = iscsi

Kubernetes computes node which will act as iSCSI storage node must
be labeled with: kolla_storage=true

When a git cache is implemented, a symlink is already in place
for the git folder when the repo server is prepared. This causes
the directory setup task to fail because the folder already
exists as a link.

This patch detects the presence of the folder and adjusts the
directory creation task to know that it should be a symlink.

The task is re-organised a bit to make it easier to read.

Different image locations need to be used in different environments and
the CI scripts should work fast both from inside the CI env and when
trying to reproduce bug anywhere.

This change adds release files for specific CI environments and also
addresses the problem of ""release types"", e.g. testing images for
promotion jobs.  Instead of composing the image URL run time, the
--release flag will be used to point to the proper image. During a
promotion job we can use `--release centosci/master-testing`. It will
default to just `--release master` when ran outside of our CI system and
if it's not a promote type job.

The CentOS CI slaves have CI_ENV defined as 'centosci' already.

Also made indenting consistent in the various ci-scripts.

and kube-apiserver wait for the network config service which write
network configs to etcd. Otherwise, they will fail.

_show_port() can raise a PortNotFound exception, but the method
get_instance_id_by_floating_address() doesn't handle it. On the
other hand, the method returns None if fip doesn't contain
port_id as a normal case.
On the caller side, ""Delete a floating ip"" API can use the returned
value None to disassociate_and_release_floating_ip() and the method
handles the None as a normal value.

So this patch makes get_instance_id_by_floating_address return None

This patch adds support for floating ips in OVN.

1. Added functions for create, delete & update for floating ip's.
2. Set the lport option column of the floating ip port to ""fixed-ip-port=<lport
id of vm ip>, router-port=<lrouter port id>
3. Add router gateway port as an lrouter_port and set the default gw.

If anyone wants to try floating ip's, pick the following patch from ovs.

We already have a lot of technical debt. This test adds checks for 3
of the types we currently have. There will be follow up patches for
adding tests for more of the types later. The tests this implements
are:
1. Not having explicit namespaces on namespaced resources.
2. Having namespaces in the template description. Its implied by the
   namespace in the deployment/petset/daemonset/replicationcontroller
3. Not having a nodeSelector on a resource.

It also white lists all existing occurrences so they can be picked
off in followup patches and tested for correctness.

one of the following for the liberty and stable/mitaka branches:

- aio
- func
- docs

Any other jobs are scenario tests which were only introduced in
Newton.

It also cleans up several regex tests into the same skip rule so
that only trusty jobs run against the liberty and stable/mitaka
branches.

The rule to run trusty jobs for newton/master is also tightened
up.

When extending a volume in a THIN pool, Cinder has no checks of whether
the new allocated space is provisioned by the backend. This allow a
tenant, with enough quota space to extend the volume to a size much
higher than the provisioned space reported by the backend.  So, before
extending a volume, Cinder manager should check this and make sure to
fail such kind of requests.

The size of deployment_info grows as n^2 depending on
nodes number. That's because common_attrs, which is
merged into each node's contains info about all nodes.

For example for 600 nodes we store about 1Gb of data in
the database. So as first step let's store common_attrs
separately in deployment_info structure inside python
code and in the database.

fails at a late stage in the processing then the 'device_id' and
'device_owner' attributes of the port are still changed. The
failed operation should not change them.

The reason is, as of commit 0947458018725b241603139f4ec6f92e84b2f29b,
the update of those attributes happens outside of the DB transaction.
For failed operation, the values are not reset back to their original
values.

(cherry picked from commit cb8af9bd50659daca4c1dea4070a011190ef3461)

Also fixes: Fixes the midonet test_l3 unit test failures

Failures for midonet unit tests seems to be caused due
to nested rollback.
Referred https://review.openstack.org/#/c/230481/
for this fix.

During the upgrade, new ports will be created, because there are new
agents configured (change of the hostnames to be RFC1034 compliant).

We have the choice to either remove old ports or change the new ports.
Working with the new ports and removing the old ports has an impact on
the instances: they will need to wait for dhcp end of lease to get their
updated dns (because the dns would be on a new port). This cause issues
with name resolution.

This commit takes the other approach to reduce instance dns resolution
downtime, by disabling the new agents and deleting them from the nets
holding a agent with the old hostname (those networks have a port in
BUILD state after an upgrade). The old dhcp port will then be correctly
registered back in neutron.

By default ips for auto-addressed subnets can not be removed from port
using port_update workflow. But during subnet_delete it has to be done
via update_port to make sure that ipam drivers received appropriate call
to deallocate ip addresses prior to subnet deletion.

'fixed_ips' property is tweeked to allow deletion ips from
auto-addressed subnet. 'delete_subnet' boolean is added to mark subnet
that is going to be deleted. This flag is analysed in
_get_changed_ips_for_port to skip re-adding slaac subnets for the port.

As the SR-IOV mechanism driver does not impact VLAN transparency
support, this patch overrides the check_vlan_transparency method
from the MechanismDriver base class and returns 'True'.  In this
way, inclusion of the SR-IOV mechanism driver in the list of
configured mechanism_drivers does not prevent the creation of
VLAN transparent networks.

There are many state constants held within nova.compute. Because these
now need to be used in versioned notifications, they were converted into
enums within nova.objects.fields. In order to prevent duplication, the
constants in nova.compute were converted over to use the enums created
for the notifications.

Also, because the comments in nova.compute.vm_states were not the best,
they were rearranged to more appropriately fit the lines they were
attempting to comment.

The object hash changes are ignored as it is only caused by the new
sentinel enum value _UNUSED which is not intended to be used.

Also do not do the multiplication twice for the index location.

The Calico DHCP agent runs more like a Neutron component than a Calico
component in the sense that it uses a lot of Neutron library code, which
includes two specific things:

1. It uses Neutron's file-based locking mechanism, which requires
   accessing the lock directory with similar credentials as other
   Neutron components.

2. It uses rootwrap when it needs to do privileged operations, and so
   does not need as a whole to run as root.

Therefore it makes sense for the Calico DHCP agent to run as a
non-privileged user.  The DevStack plugin already runs it as such, and
patches are up to modify the package-based installs of networking-calico
to run the DHCP agent as 'neutron' instead of as root.

It also then follows that the DHCP agent should log to /var/log/neutron
- sharing that directory with other Neutron components that log -
instead of to /var/log/calico.  With /var/log/calico, in a DevStack
install, there is a race between calico-felix and calico-dhcp-agent: if
calico-felix tries to create the directory first, it will not be
writable by calico-dhcp-agent, and then the DHCP will die.

setup_networks_on_host has not been implemented for
neutron networks and only implemented for nova net.

In order to address the L3 network issues related to the
live-migration in neutron, 'setup_networks_on_host' should
be implemented in the neutronv2/api.

This patch implements the function and updates the portbinding
profile dictionary with the 'migrating_to' key pointing to the
destination host in pre-live migration phase.

port:{'binding:profile':{'migrating_to': 'host'}}

When migrate_instance_finish() is called, it should clear
the migration profile before binding the host to the destination
port to prevent neutron from taking any action when the port-update
happens after the port migrates.

Based on the port profile update with the destination host,
the neutron will be able to create any associated L3 networks
on the destination host.

Further work is planned to issue a status update notification
to nova during the pre-live migration phase after the
L3 networks have been created on the destination host and
before the port lands on the destination host. This will
be addressed in a different patch, since we don't have such
wait state in nova at this time.

The neutron side changes are handled in different patch sets shown
below [1] server side and [2] agent side.

ansible upstream recently added a filter using jmespath to allow for
arbitrary querying of complex data structures. While reviewing that
patch, it seemed quite flexible and lovely. It's also apparently also
used in boto for similar reasons, so we're following a pretty well
tested solution - and since it's now a depend on ansible, the extra
depend shouldn't be too much of a burden for most folks.
