missing or extra spaces, extra line breaks, and inconsistent wording

There is no reason to fetch the network_info from the network api on shutdown

places where this call to the network api call can be removed but this patch
just handles the case for shutdown.

Note: the following test was removed 'test_terminate_no_fixed_ips' as
the call to the network api is no longer done so this test would be the
same as test_terminate_no_network.

On a system configured to use Neutron, for limit API, we should retrieve
quota and usage for floating IPs and security groups from Neutron,
rather than Nova DB.

We do this just in V2 API since leaving the limits code broken in V2 API
when working with Neutron is the wrong choice. In V3 API we have better
separation between Nova and Neutron since Nova doesn't proxy any
requests to Neutron for V3.

In this patch the neutronv2 API translates NuetronClientException to
NovaException with the proper code (401, 403 or 500) and that is raised
back to the os-compute API which uses the new error map in the common
module to raise the HTTP error back to the client.

The status code stuff with NovaException is a bit ugly, but there wasn't
a good 401/403 choice in NovaException already. There is a NotAuthorized
exception but it sets a 403 code, and there is a NotAllowed
NovaException but that's for a 405. So rather than define new confusing
NovaExceptions, this patch just sets the code in the NovaException that
comes back from the neutronv2 API and lets the os-compute API code
translate it.

There are also TODOs in the os-compute API code to eventually define
common abstract methods in nova.network.api.API so that nova-network and
Neutron can be handled the same way in os-compute API, but that's for a
later patch since it's a good bit of work and not necessary for this bug
fix.

The admin_token option shouldn't be used with the auth_token
middleware. It's used to specify a token to be used to perform
operations on the identity server, so would typically be set
to the admin token. The admin token should only be used to
initially set up the Keystone server, and then the admin token
functionality should be disabled. If this recommended setup is
used then the auth_token middleware shouldn't be using the
admin token / auth_token.

In preparing for removal of the admin_token option, the option
is now deprecated. A warning will be logged if it's set.

To allow accurate billing of VMs based on which state they are in,
this metric polls state on the pipeline interval, but also watches for
any instance events to ensure accurate state transition data.

A couple of new metrics were added (one for polling, and one for
notifications) that both return the same sample meter name. The
implementation is based on the way the instance metric currently
works.

Have also added some basic tests for it, and a module 'vm_states'
which holds the state name -> int mapping.

Measurement added to docs.

Commit dc8de42 makes nova persist image format to a file to avoid
attacks based on changing it later. However the way it was implemented
leaves a small window of opportunity for the file to be truncated before
it gets written back to effectively making it possible for data to get
lost leaving us with a potential problem next time it is attempted to be
read.

This patch changes the way file is updated to be atomic, thus closing
the race window (and also removes the chown that we did not really
need).

It is worth noting that a better solution to this would be
to allow the code calling the imagebackend to write the file (once!)
and make it impossible to update after the boot process is done. This
approach would require more refactoring of the libvirt driver code, and
may be done in the future.

To avoid update errors from Oslo, all projects importing timeutils will

The TimeOverride fixture was introduced in patch ef5d2af7 for the ease

However now that we plan to remove set_time_override (lp 1266962),
this helper class is needed no more.

Mocking timeutils without set_time_override() in TimeOverride does not help
since the test scripts lose control of the mocking value.

The test_password_hashed method was defined in
test_backend.IdentityTests. This is a bad place for it because not
all backends do password hashing (for example, the LDAP backend
doesn't), and it was also implemented in a way where it called a
private method of the backend, which the SQL backend implemented
differently (it requires an SQLAlchemy session).

The test_password_hashed method is moved into the KVS backend
test class, since the current implementation is specific to the KVS
backend.

The oslo.messaging library takes the existing RPC code from oslo and
wraps it in a sane API with well defined semantics around which we can
make a commitment to retain compatibility in future.

The patch is large and hard to be split into different patches, but the
changes can be summarized as:

* Remove openstack/common/{rpc, notifier, log_handler} modules dependency
(superceded by oslo.messaging)

* New config option `conductor.workers_pool_size` add to determine the
size of the workers greenthread pool.

* PeriodicService class refactored and renamed to RPCService, all periodic
tasks methods were moved to the ConductorManager class leaving RPCService
class to be resposable for setting up and starting the RPCServer from
oslo.messaging only.

* In oslo.messaging, a request context is expected to be a dict so the
method RequestContext.{to,from}_dict() was updated/added to the module.

* The allowed_rpc_exception_modules configuration option is replaced
by an allowed_remote_exmods get_transport() parameter. This is not
something that users ever need to configure, but it is something each
project using oslo.messaging needs to be able to customize.

* New common/rpc.py module added to wrap the global messaging state. It
also contains transport aliases for backwards compatibility with IceHouse
rpc_backend configuration values.

Using systemd-nspawn gives us more flexibility in what hardware the
agent can see. With this setup, the network is not virtualized, and the
/dev inside the container looks nearly identical to the one in the host.

Also added RestartSec=30s to the unit file because without this, systemd
will respawn the agent every 100ms if it dies (say, because DHCP hasn't
completed yet). Since it retries a max of 5 times per 60s, unless the restart value is
set higher it will be marked 'failed' forever and not retry. Adding this prevents that.

Make the nova.virt.ironic driver pass the ephemeral_gb flavor spec, if
present, to Ironic via driver_info/pxe_ephemeral_gb. Will also forward
the CONF.default_ephemeral_format value to Ironic.

This patch also adds a default ephemeral format CONF option to
ironic.drivers.modules.pxe, just in case this isn't sent from Nova, eg.
because the config option has no default value.

In spec/cinder_common_spec.rb, the most complex template, there is a
context for commonly named attributes, those which name matches a
node attribute with keys ['openstack']['block-storage'][attr_key],
storage_availability_zone for instance. This pattern is used in lots
of configuration spec blocks, for example in
['openstack']['block-storage']['vmware'][attr_key].
I've also found what appear to be some incongruences, like duplicated
conditional checks for volume driver types and repeated storwize
settings at the bottom. Perhaps these should be checked in another
bug.

By request, I am posting a cosmetic changeset to clean up spelling,
formatting, whitespace, and comments (some visible by script users) in
training-labs. A few variables and function names have been changed
(decapitalization, consistency).

Scope: This changeset does not affect the workings of the code and
therefore does not fix bugs. Bug fixes go into separate patches.

Special notes:
* Scripts/Neutron/Neutron.sh still installs quantum, but the naming
  within said script is now consistent. That can only be temporary,
  a switch to a more recent release should happen soonish.

* I left the numbers for steps in some scripts (Glance.sh); maybe
  the manuals are meant to refer to these numbers!? Of course, they
  will change occasionally (this time, for instance, I changed them
  to match the actual order).

* Scripts that use non-standard functionality should use bash, not sh;
  shebangs fixed

* I didn't touch README.md, training-guides-cluster-scripts.tar: these,
  too, are for a separate changeset

There's a number of cases where we grab a lock and then spawn a worker
to complete an action. Since the TaskManager() is not being used as a
context manager in these cases, it's really easy to mess this up and
create a code path where we accidentally leave a node locked.

This patch adds support to TaskManager to allow you to spawn a worker
on __exit__. This consolidates all of the logic to make sure we unlock
a node when we should. All cases where we lock and spawn a worker have
been updated to use this.

This happens to fix a bug in set_console_mode() where there's a path
that can leave a node locked. If the console is already in the
appropriate mode, it doesn't spawn a worker, however it would leave
the node locked.

This also fixes a bug in _check_deploy_timeouts() where if the spawn
failed due to something other than NoFreeConductorWorkers or if
the thread-finished-callback linking failed, we would leave a node
locked.

Tests where we're actually testing eventlet's thread behavior with
respect to link() have been moved to the task_manager test file.
They were refactored to remove unnecessary sleeps and incorrect
assumptions about eventlet scheduling. (They assumed that a spawn()
scheduled the new thread immediately.)

self._spawn_worker() tests in test_manager were also moved to their own
test class to be true unit tests.

This patch adds the ""ssh"" element to the list of elements
  used for the generation of the HDP ""plain"" image.  This image
  does not contain any HDP installed packages, but is configured
  for deploying HDP Hadoop clusters.

This patch also adds the disable-firewall element to the list of
  elements for the generation of the HDP ""plain"" image.  Recent testing
  showed that the plain image was not supporting cluster startups
  since Apache Ambari requires that the iptables service be turned
  off for nodes in an HDP cluster.

When deleting a stack during an abandon we want to refrain from deleting
the underlying resources, but there is no need to modify their templates to
do so. In fact, that is highly undesirable because it leaves the system in
an incoherent state, and causes problems for moving away from
templates-as-dictionaries to having an internal template API.

The nova client already has the following flavor commands:

flavor-access-add    Add flavor access for the given tenant.
flavor-access-list   Print access information about the given flavor.
flavor-access-remove Remove flavor access for the given tenant.
flavor-create        Create a new flavor
flavor-delete        Delete a specific flavor
flavor-key           Set or unset extra_spec for a flavor.
flavor-list          Print a list of available 'flavors' (sizes of
flavor-show          Show details about the given flavor.

This covers what nova-manage flavor was providing so let's deprecate the
legacy nova-manage subcommand and mark it for removal in the K release.

There is not a bug or blueprint for this. The flavor subcommand is
completely duplicated in nova client. It is accessing the database
directly and we want to move to using flavor objects which would go
through conductor. So this could be considered part of the objects
conversion for flavors.

For some other commands like service, db and host it makes sense to
leave those so you can access the database before the api service is
running, but that's not the case for flavors.

UpgradeImpact: nova-manage flavor command is deprecated, use nova client

The calls to logging and translation prove expensive when called
many times for large lists of hosts during the scheduling process.

This introduces a new config variable to allow deployers to enable
the logging when looking to debug their scheduler configuration:
scheduler_enable_logging

We default to doing no longer, the option that gives the best
performance.

Updates install-openstack-clients so that it parses args rather than
using positional parameters.

Updates the various source install elements so that we use a
new {CLIENTNAME}_VENV_DIR variable (set via an environment.d hook)
to configure the virtualenv directory. The in element default is
the same as before (/opt/stack/venvs/python-clientname)

We also add support for controlling the virtualenv
--system-site-packages options by passing -s to the
install-openstack-client bin. This is externally
controllable by setting the {CLIENTNAME}_EXTRA_INSTALL_OPTS
variable. (defaults to """")

This is cleaner in that we aren't hard coding /opt/stack/venv
everywhere and also supports both isolated and shared
venvs (which some people would like to use).

Infra team has indicated that tearDown should not be used and should
be replaced with addCleanup in all places.

All addCleanup methods will be executed even if one of them fails, while
a failure in tearDown method can leave the rest of the tearDown un-executed,
which can leave stale state laying around.

Moreover, tearDown methods won't run if an exception raises in setUp method,
while addCleanup will run in such case.

This patch replaces tearDown with addCleanup or removes redundant tearDown
methods in cinder unit tests.

MySQL has no native boolean type. MySQL boolean type is just an alias

Thus with Postgres, reflection of a boolean type column default value will
return either 'true' or 'false'. Model must have compatible
`server_default` argument in columns definition.

Overview:
MySQL requires indexes on foreign keys. Such an index is created on the
referencing table automatically if it does not exist.

Motivation:
MySQL names foreign keys indexes differently dependent from itself
version. Implicit fk indexes is MySQL specific behavior, so it should be
ignored during comparision. We plan to use Alembic to compare models and
migrations I0758c7e09d1d46ce870c3f94f76c2a177955e143. Alembic doesn't support
5.5 naming convention. So we need consistent index name for all MySQL versions
to be easily ignored.

Solution:
A new migration script renames incorrectly named fk indexes on MySQL.

Reproduction:
Stop execution when foregn keys will be initialized. See schema with
your MySQL shell client. With 5.5, indexes which was not named
explicitly, will have a name such as <tablename>_<columnname>_fk, with 5.1 it
will be <columnname>.

only the local ip address is set. bridge_mappings needs to be added to support
vlan isolation.

This requires changing the form of the existing ovs-vsctl command to set

This patch adds an initial version of the Dogtag plugin
that implements the decrypt(), encrypt() and generate()
functions.  In this version, we will create and initialize
an NSS database on the server to do crypto operations
within the Dogtag DRM python client.  This allows us to
decrypt() and encrypt() secrets without passing in wrapping
keys.

When the barbican-client and the Barbican server API have
been changed to pass through the wrapping keys, this plugin
will need to enhanced to make the relevant DRM client calls.

This plugin has been tested by running the barbican server
within a virtual environment.  There are several steps
needed to get things configured, which are detailed in the
blueprint.

Added unit tests.  These unit tests will be skipped if the
dogtag dependencies are not present to import.

There was a bug in the code that checked to see if the
appropriate WWPN for a preferred node was available on the storage
host in intialize_connection.  It was assumed that there would only
ever be one preferred WWPN.  The code just checked to see if the list of
preferred WWPNs was in the list of available WWPNs.  This would only work
if all of the WWPNs were available on the storage host.  This resulted in
volumes not being able to be mounted when they should have been
available.

This fix changes the check of the preferred WWPNs to check each
item in the list until one is found.  The first one found is used
as the target WWPN.  If no match is found, the old default behavior
of selecting the first available WWPN is used.  I have added a
warning message for this case as it is quite possible that this
won't work in the user's environment as was the case that uncovered
this bug.

Note that this change is only relevant for systems that are not using
multipath as systems that use multipath don't choose one WWPN, they
just send the whole available list back.

Radware's load balancer currently supports three network interfaces.
Prior to this code addition, the configuration of those three
interfaces was: one interface for management, one for high
availability backup, and one for load balancing servers where the
IP that the outside world sees (VIP) and the IP that the servers
respond to (PIP) are identical.

This change adds a new ""2-legged"" configuration: one interface for
management, one interface for a VIP network, and one interface for the
PIP and the high availability backup network.

During VIP creation, the LBaaS driver detects if the incoming
configuration is ""2-legged"" by comparing VIP and PIP networks.  If they
are different it allocates a new port on the PIP network in order to
obtain an IP address for the PIP and names that port after its
associated VIP ID.  vDirect is then directed to create a load balancer
with the PIP network also used as the HA network instead of using the
vDirect container's default HA network configuration.

During VIP deletion, the LBaas driver detects if a port for the PIP
had been previously allocated by searching for and deleting port names
that map to the VIP ID.

Current `_Iterator` streams data from the server by default. This
behavior, although useful, shouldn't be considered a sane default. A
good example is when using `limit` on listing operations. If the default
is to stream, the limit will be ignored because the server client will
get everything from the server until there's anything left to consume.
This behavior can also be harmful if not used carefully.

This patch adds a `stream` method to the iterator and makes using this
behavior an explicit operation. The user has to opt-in for data
streaming.

The previous code was failing to display the members of server

This patch adds support for 'ha_nodes' option
of Murano Repository service. This
options should contain a string with
all controller nodes and service ports.

For example:
ha_nodes = node-1:8084, node-2:8084, node-3:8084

Port 8084 will be listened by other controllers
and any changes made will be replicated to all
other controllers.

Firewall should be opend to allow this port
to be accessed by other controllers through
the management network.

The Repository service uses Keystone's auth
tokens for authentificetion on other
controller nodes.

nodes_to_node_port_list function generates
this string from the array of controller nodes.

Some virt drivers may not support/need to use instance.name and have
a different way to find out if an instance exists. NOTE: this still
uses dict access on instance, as the _run_instance() path is not
converted to Instance objects yet.

NOTE: This also removes a duplicate call to self._lookup_by_name()
in libvirt's resume_state_on_host_boot(). It was calling
self.instance_exists() and then self._lookup_by_name(), but instance_exists()
calls _lookup_by_name() itself.

The test_integration_1 test was waiting on volume being in an
'in-use' state before proceeding. However the 'in-use' state
doesn't actually mean that the volume is attached, as 'attaching'
gets mapped to 'in-use' in nova.

This makes it possible for the test to proceed when the volume is
in an attaching state, and not actually ever attached. Which means
you can get to the detach phase on an non attached volume, and
thus explode.

Use the attachment status to filter out when then volume is not
actually ready.

In the process, make the test name something that's actually
descriptive for what it does.

In OpenStack dashboard, error messages that pop up to end users
present several problems:
 * When they are based on exception message,
   they are often too technical and/or not helpful.
 * When they are set by horizon code, they cannot
   (without changing source code) be customized by cloud
   providers (that may want to adapt them to their business rules)

This patch is a first attempt to address this problem.
It's a work in progress and we hope it will be a good
start for discussions and early feedbacks.

How does it work:
 * It adds an adapter class called HTMLException:
   it's aimed to be the HTML part of an exception.
   HTMLException wrap python exceptions when it happen and provides a
   method called ""render"" that knows how to render
   the underlying exception object.

 * When an exception is being rendered, the render method will
   look up for a django templates (for that, it tries to map
   the exception class name to a template name),
   if no specific template for that class of exception in defined,
   it falls back to a default template.

 * Templates are created under a directory called ""exceptions"",
   ""base"" and ""default"" template can be provided by OpenStack dashboard,
   when specific exceptions templates may be defined by users
   throw another Django application. (we include specific template
   in this patch mainly for example).

 * To be flexible on how to render an exception,
   templates will get in their context:
     * The exception object being raised
     * The exception class
     * The exception traceback.
     * Error message set in horizon source code (if any).

agent crashed because OpenStack is trying to add same IPv6 addresses
to dhcp tap device.

The root cause is that current code compares provided unshortened
IPv6 address with the returned result of ""ip addr list"", which is
shortened. So the same IPv6 address is treated as different ones.

The fix is trying to shorten the provided address before comparison.

Adding a scripts/set-pip-vars script that simplifies the setting
of DIB_PIP_MANIFEST_ environment variables from pip manifests for
disk image builds

Intent is that developers can run e.g. :

 source <(set-pip-vars ${TRIPLEO_ROOT}/undercloud_manifest)

To set all their DIB_PIP_MANIFEST environment variables for
building that stack of tripleo.

e.g. deploy-ramdisk, seed, undercloud, overcloud-control, overcloud-compute

In addition that they can use it to alter their setup:

e.g. source <(set-pip-vars my-manifest/dib-pip-manifest*client)
