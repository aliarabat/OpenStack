Per the referenced bug, we weren't accounting for the scenario where a
reshape operation was removing *all* inventories for a provider (which
could be fairly common). With this fix, we do a three-stage lookup of
the provider object: If it's not in the inventories, we look in the
allocations; if it's not in the allocations, we look it up in the

The use of the independent context on _ensure_aggregate appears to
be unnecessary. It causes file-based uses of SQLite dbs to fail
(with database locked errors, as reported in the associated bug,
1789633) and thus may mask issues with other databases. Adding the
independent context manager was the result of a series of ""throw
stuff at the wall and see what sticks"" patches, but it looks now
that it is not required, and in some situations causes problems.

Runs through the gate show that the behavior it was fixing (as
described in bug 1786703) is not happening.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

When we're logging a warning within a ComputeHostNotFound exception
block, oslo.log appears to be automatically logging the exception
trace. When starting a nova-compute service for the first time, these
ComputeHostNotFound warnings are expected until the ResourceTracker
creates the ComputeNode records in the cell database, so tracing the
warning is ugly and clutters up the log on the first startup.

Passing exc_info=False should tell the log handler to not trace the
exception that's in scope.

When booting from volume, nova doesn't check volume quota
before we actually try to create the volumes during
_prep_block_device. If the project is at their volume quota
limit, Cinder will fail and we'll get an OverQuota exception
during _build_resources. This is also counted as a build
failure in _failed_build() which checks the
[compute]/consecutive_build_service_disable_threshold config
option and can eventually auto-disable the nova-compute service
on this host, e.g. if Dastardly Dan is already over quota for
volumes but continually makes lots of consecutive build
requests for new servers, they could eventually disable the
compute services in the cloud.

This handles the specific volume OverQuota case and raises a
new type of exception, BuildAbortExceptionDoNotDisable,
which is eventually handled in _do_build_and_run_instance and
returns a new type of build_results enum which
build_and_run_instance can use to determine if it should be
counted against a systemic consecutive build failure or just
consider it as user-error and reset the build failure counter.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

This is step 1 in retiring some infra repositories. It adds noop-jobs to
repos that we want to retire for those that have jobs.

Repos to retire are:
openstack-infra/activity-board
openstack-infra/beaker-localhost
openstack-infra/beaker-nodepool
openstack-infra/err2d2
openstack-infra/featuretracker
openstack-infra/js-afs-blob-store
openstack-infra/js-openstack-registry-hooks
openstack-infra/js-generator-openstack
openstack-infra/puppet-docker_registry
openstack-infra/puppet-featuretracker
openstack-infra/puppet-releasestatus
openstack-infra/pypi-mirror
openstack-infra/releasestatus
openstack-infra/trystack-site
openstack-infra/puppet-vinz
openstack-infra/vinz
openstack-infra/vinz-webclient
openstack-infra/zuul-packaging

Rationale:

openstack-infra/activity-board:
  Was part of bitergia work with openstack which is no longer done

openstack-infra/beaker-localhost
openstack-infra/beaker-nodepool
  These may have been attempts at having puppet beaker testing
  play nice with our CI but we hacked around it by pointing the
  beaker config at localhost. There are no commits here should be
  safe to retire.

openstack-infra/featuretracker
openstack-infra/puppet-featuretracker
  The product WG is abandoned, see
  http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/user-committee/2018-February/002599.html.
  The website  http://featuretracker.openstack.org is also dead.

openstack-infra/err2d2
  Part of a plan to make our IRC bots errbot driven but more
  recent spec has us sticking with supybot fork and plugins.

openstack-infra/js-afs-blob-store
openstack-infra/js-openstack-registry-hooks
  Allowed us to mirror npm packages on afs until npm grew too
  large. I think we can retire this as we don't mirror npm any
  longer.

openstack-infra/js-generator-openstack
  Appears to be a cookiecutter like system for openstack js
  projects. Maybe we should just use cookiecutter?

openstack-infra/pypi-mirror
  Was tooling to make a mirror of a subset of pypi. We moved to
  bandersnatch and now just proxy cache pypi.

openstack-infra/trystack-site
  Trystack has been retired due to spam and the passport program
  is suggested instead.

openstack-infra/puppet-docker_registry
  This is unused, there are other alternatives that can be used.

openstack-infra/puppet-vinz
openstack-infra/vinz
openstack-infra/vinz-webclient
  Project to provide alternate Gerrit UI that never got commits.

openstack-infra/releasestatus
openstack-infra/puppet-releasestatus
  releasestatus is not used since December 2015, see
  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/254817

openstack-infra/zuul-packaging
  This is unused and outdated.

Prior to this patch the maintenance thread would fail to fix a router
port resource upon a failure in OVN to create it.

The maintence thread was calling the add_router_interface() method from
the l3_ovn.py module but, if the router port already existed in Neutron
(but didn't exist in OVN) that method would fail with a PortInUse
exception.

This patch accounts for that problem and if the port router already
exist in Neutron it will only fetch it from the database and continue
the work until it's created in the OVN database as well.

A new functional test has been added which to test this scenario.

Backport note: This is squashing also f69b68d7d36c79bba211648acd5939ee3e52cd7a
which adds the functional tests to the maintenance feature.

This commit is a squash of backported fixes.

1) Recent pep8 upgrade and corresponding pycodestyle update break pep8 job
due to the new rules. This commit fixes the following new errors:

  - E711 comparison to None should be 'if cond is None:'
  - E402 module level import not at top of file
  - W503 line break before binary operator

2) pip 10 now reports an error when calling pip without package name,
effectively breaking stable branches. This patch also fix this by
modifying tox_install.sh

3) devstack: teach how to handle latest ODL release

- Pin rally to 0.12.1
- Use latest ODL version for jobs

This patch introduces support for running custom validations by changing
the behavior of the validations actions ListValidationsAction,
ListGroupsAction and RunValidationAction.

Until now, these actions sourced validations from a directory on disk.
Now, these action are sourcing validations from the plan container
subdirectory (custom validations), or, if this is not available, from
the Swift container holding the default validations.

When HA router's interface on host is going DOWN but router
is still available on this host, L2 population
mechanism driver will now send to other hosts info to remove
fdb unicast entries to this port on host.

It will not send FLOODING_ENTRY because this port is still on
host but in standby mode and might be transformed to master
in future.

This solves issue with migration router from Legacy to HA.
In such case, port which was originally attached to legacy
router is transformed to be HA backup port before changing
its status to DOWN.
Now in such case unicast entries to this port and backup
node will be removed properly so packets to HA router will
be really send to host which is master node for router.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

/reshaper provides a way to atomically modify some allocations and
inventory in a single transaction, allowing operations like migrating
some inventory from a parent provider to a new child.

A fair amount of code is reused from handler/inventory.py, some
refactoring is in order before things get too far with that.

In handler/allocation.py some code is extracted to its own methods
so it can be reused from reshaper.py.

This is done as microversion 1.30.

A suite of gabbi tests is provided which attempt to cover various
failures including schema violations, generation conflicts, and
data conflicts.

api-ref, release notes and rest history are updated

This patch adds the new /v1/coe endpoint to the API that can be
used to list the COEs and their supported network and volume drivers
where the network drivers is also filtered on the allowed drivers.

There is no logic in Magnum right now that acts as a manager for the
COEs so they are somewhat hardcoded right now but as long as the format
of the new endpoint is OK we can always clean that up.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the

puppet-ovn uses puppet-vswitch to configure the OVN params. When OVS binaries are
compiled with dpdk support and when vs_config provider runs the command
'ovs-vsctl list Open_vSwitch .', the below warning messages are seen and
are part of the command output.

----

We see the error 'undefined method 'chomp' for nil:NilClass' when the result is
extracted. This patch fixes this issue by checking if the 'value' var is nil or
not before 'parse_column_value' is called.

Tripleo deployment with OVN is failing because of this issue.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements

The Neutron OVS agent logs can get flooded with KeyErrors as the
'_get_port_info' method skips the added/removed dict items if no
ports have been added/removed, which are expected to be present,
even if those are just empty sets.

This change ensures that those port info dict fields are always set.

It looks that current keepalived version which is available in
Ubuntu Xenial repositories (1:1.2.24-1ubuntu0.16.04.1) is broken
and cause failure of some functional tests in Neutron.
Details are in [1].
Older version works fine so as temporary solution we can use
this version in functional tests.

This issue don't happens on master and stable/rocky branch, as there
newer cloud-archive repo is used and it has newer version of keepalived
which works fine.

neutron base class have base create method like create_network,
create_routers, create_port and create_subnets etc and these
base method append the created resources in base class variable
like cls.ports, cls.sunets etc.

These variable were initially  created and used while cleanup the
created resources in corresponding delete methods. But now those
delete methods has been switched to use addClassResourceCleanup.

Few test class still use them for list resources etc which is
hard to find that these were from base class and value is being
populated from derived class test cases.

This commit removes the base class variables and define those
in derived test class wherever they are being used.

This adds a module that behaves like mock.sentinel, but that
returns UUIDs suitable for use in tests where we need that
specifically.

This code is from [1], but have some difference:
1. The enforced-singleton stuff is removed [2], and the
_UUIDSentinels class is private and a uuids instance is exposed.
2. Add some doc strings for it.

There is an alternate patch [2] in oslo.utils.

This module is used by Nova and Placement, so we extract it
into oslotest library.

This patchset adds a distinct group for each of the validation
methodologies:

  * oslo.policy approach => policy_validation
  * custom requirements approach => requirements_validation

policy_validation receives the following options:

  * custom_policy_files

requirements_validation receives the following options:

  * custom_requirements_file
  * test_custom_requirements

Background: In the initial Patrole spec for project creation submitted
to qa-specs [0] there is much discussion about oslo.policy-driven vs.
requirements-driven approach to RBAC validation. Long story short:
Patrole by default does oslo.policy validation but later added
requirements-driven validation [1]. However, the options for both
ways of doing validation should be made as distinct as possible to
avoid confusion between which options to use for which validation
methods.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

This is Pike only fix. If there are multiple migration requests
for the same instance, the placement inventory might
not be cleaned up in time, leading to further migration requests
to this compute to fail:

  Placement API returning an error response:

Change migration timeout to 180 seconds.
Both nova-compute and neutron-openvswitch-agent have to be up to
have live-migration working. Added check for neutron's part.

Add a private _UUIDSentinels() class to oslo_utils.fixture that behaves
like a mock.sentinel, but returns specifically UUIDs. Expose a
(singleton) instance of it called uuidsentinel. This is mostly copied
from [1], with the following differences:

- We don't do the enforced-singleton thing [2]. But importing the
  uuidsentinel global yields the same behavior.
- We don't do the local import thing [3][4], because we're already in
  the right lib, so no issues with circular imports.
- Locking is added to make this threadsafe. (See discussion at [5])

Note that there is some question as to whether it is more appropriate
for this to live here or in oslotest [6]. This has been discussed on the
dev ML [7] and it was concluded [8] that it should live here.

The local request start and end times (combined with jitter, if
provided) define a window of tolerable remote times. When the remote
time falls outside of that window, output the delta to get *within* the
window rather than the delta to get *to the end* of the window.

Additionally, output both the starting and ending local time if they
format differently; this avoids confusing output when the request takes
a while to complete and the remote has a time before the local time.

To check affinity and anti-affinity policies for scheduling instances,
we use the RequestSpec.instance_group.hosts field to check the hosts
that have group members on them. Access of the 'hosts' field calls
InstanceGroup.get_hosts during a lazy-load and get_hosts does a query
for all instances that are members of the group and returns their hosts
after removing duplicates. The InstanceList query isn't targeting any
cells, so it will return [] in a multi-cell environment in both the
instance create case and the instance move case. In the move case, we
do have a cell-targeted RequestContext when setup_instance_group is
called *but* the RequestSpec.instance_group object is queried early in
compute/api before we're targeted to a cell, so a call of
RequestSpec.instance_group.get_hosts() will result in [] still, even
for move operations.

This makes setup_instance_group query all cells for instances that are
members of the instance group if the RequestContext is untargeted, else
it queries the targeted cell for the instances.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

There was a eventlet.monkey_patch [1] when we launch a nova
process(like nova-api, nova-compute), but it's invalid under
the uwsgi mode.

But there are concurrency requirements in the api service, such
as, when listing instances cross multiple cells we're using
greenthreads and oslo.db does a time.sleep to allow switching
greenthreads [2].

So, in this patch we add the monkey_patch in the uwsgi
application setup and refactor the monkey patching to use common
code.

Before we stored flavors in instance_extra, certain fields, defined
in nova.compute.flavors.system_metadata_flavor_props, were stored
in the instance.system_metadata for the embedded instance.flavor.
The ""disabled"" field wasn't one of those keys, however, so really
old instances that had their embedded flavor converted to the
serialized instance_extra form won't have the disabled attribute
set and we need to default those here so callers, like the
versioned notfication FlavorPayload, don't explode trying to load
instance.flavor.disabled.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.
