Deploy of VM occasionally fails due to file system related error
during config drive creation for the VM. Hence, adding a retry
logic for vopt create as part of deploy. In case, if there's
an OSError exception we'll attempt a retry of config drive
image creation.

Exception along the `starting` inspection code may causes
`no defined transition` error as there is no transition for
`starting` state on timeout event.

Also it could happen if small timeout configured, so there
is not enough time for starting -> waiting transition,
e.g. new greenthread spawn is blocked due to missing of
available slots.

The existing guideline recommends to do a GET on a tag to check its
existence, while our HTTP guideline recommends HEAD for such checks.
Since this is just a check, we should recommend HEAD in this case.
Wording was also added to the HTTP guideline stating that in all cases
where HEAD is implemented, the corresponding GET must be implemented,
too.

After configuring networking in the container, we used a task to wait
for SSH to respond on the container, using the Ansible wait_for module
trying to connect to port 22.

When managing containers in Ansible using other connection plugins that
use LXC commands on the physical host to execute modules, there may not
be an SSH daemon running within the container. In these situations we
can accomplish the same check without SSH by using the wait_for_connection
module (new in ansible 2.3) to verify that Ansible has a working execution
path into the container, but not necessarily via SSH.

The following Neutron agents:
- neutron-metadata
- neutron-dhcp-agent
- neutron-l3-agent
- neutron-lbaasv2-agent
- neutron-vpn-agent
doesn't require ml2_conf.ini file.
ml2_conf.ini file is used to managed L2 network configuration.
This config doesn't have to be in DHCP, L3, metadata agents...

We should remove it to avoid restarting these agents in case of
ml2_conf.ini file modification.
Only neutron-server, neutron-openvswitch-agent,
neutron-linuxbridge-agent must be restarted.

This creates a specific slice which all OpenStack services will operate
from. By creating an independent slice these components will be governed
away from the system slice allowing us to better optimise resource
consumption.

See the following for more information on slices:

* https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.slice.html

See for following for more information on resource controls:

* https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html

Tools like ``systemd-cgtop`` and ``systemd-cgls`` will now give us
insight into specific processes, process groups, and resouce consumption
in ways that we've not had access to before. To enable some of this reporting
the accounting options have been added to the [Service] section of the unit
file.

Firstly, _find_base_file was differentiating between 2 different types
of 'non-original', but the caller was then treating them identically.
This differentiation was obviously redundant.

However, the caller was using them to populate originals. Note that
_scan_base_files has been called previously, and therefore originals
is already correctly populated. This means that _find_base_file does
not need to identify 'originals' at all.

Additionally, originals is only tracked at all so that 'originals' and
'non-originals' can be aged with different frequencies. This doesn't
really make any sense anyway, so this is a small step towards removing
a redundant config variable.

This creates a specific slice which all OpenStack services will operate
from. By creating an independent slice these components will be governed
away from the system slice allowing us to better optimise resource
consumption.

See the following for more information on slices:

See for following for more information on resource controls:

* https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html

Tools like ``systemd-cgtop`` and ``systemd-cgls`` will now give us
insight into specific processes, process groups, and resouce consumption
in ways that we've not had access to before. To enable some of this reporting
the accounting options have been added to the [Service] section of the unit

os-client-config currently maintains this mapping in-tree:

  http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/os-client-config/tree/os_client_config/constructors.json

but it's useful to more people than os-client-config. It's also REALLY
disruptive to consumers when it changes (magnum changed its service type
from container to container-infra which broke being able to look up the
constructor, which in turn broke code consuming such a thing), so a
central list with oversight seems maybe useful.

As a follow up, a document, maybe not in this repo, but that we can
reference, that describes the interface that a client library
constructor should present, would be super friendly.

Translator yet. The current implementation of scaling policy
in Heat Translator showed the couple between scaling and
monitoring policies. But actually monitoring policy shows
that it could have other very good use cases so that it
can stand alone.
This patch will implement monitoring policy in HT.

This method has grown to be one of the most hideous methods in
Neutron. It's well past Icehouse so it's time to address the
REVISIT and get rid of it entirely. :)

This patch refactors ML2 and the db_base_plugin_v2 delete_subnet
method so ML2 can perform its ML2-specific tasks with callbacks
and db_base_plugin_v2 can handle the rest.

Backport justification: it solves bug 1672701.

In change Ib62001c03e1e08f58cf0c6e0ba07a8879a584084 we switched the
rabbitmq queues HA mode from ha-all to ha-exactly. While this gives us a
nice performance boost with rabbitmq, it makes rabbit less resilient to
network glitches as we painfully found out via

Will propose another THT change to actually change the default to
-1 so we get this ha-mode:all by default.

away from the system slice allowing us to better optimise resource

The backoff timer has a few issues that can cause it to get stuck
in an infinite loop and never time out.

  1. The random.gauss() function used to generate random jitter can
     return negative values, so when it does, it makes the elapsed time
     self._error_time go ""backward.""
  2. The random jitter is used as a multiplier for the self._interval,
     so self._interval can deviate far away from the mean over time and
     walk to zero, causing self._interval to be 0, which will prevent
     the timer from making progress from that point on because idle
     will always evaluate to zero and the elapsed time won't increase.
  3. The evaluated interval doesn't have a lower bound, so over time
     it can get extremely small if jitter (the mean) < 0.5.

This adds a min_interval keyword argument to the BackOffLoopingCall
start() function that defaults to 0.001s and uses it to lower bound
the interval calculations. We'll also take the absolute value of the
return from random.gauss() to prevent elapsed time going backward, and
we'll calculate the running self._interval separately to make it track
the desired growth rate of the backoff and not let it drift with the
random.gauss() values.

The server tagging API in Nova uses the ""PUT"" HTTP method to
set or update the tags of a server. This API doesn't expect
a body, although it is one of the HTTP methods where a body
is expected (""PUT"" + ""POST""). Nova queries the content length
of the request, to check if there is a body to deserialize.
The HTTP header ""Content-Length"" is read for that. If we use
""None"" for the body in the PUT request, Nova cannot properly
determine that the content_length is basically zero. The tempest
tests for server tagging will fail because Nova raises a BadRequest
exception:

  [tempest.lib.common.rest_client]
  Request - Headers:
  {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Accept': 'application/json',
  'X-OpenStack-Nova-API-Version': '2.26', 'X-Auth-Token': '<omitted>'}

  Body: {""badRequest"":
          {""message"": ""Malformed request body"", ""code"": 400}
        }

For some reason this, this seems to only occur on centos7 test nodes,
but not on ubuntu xenial nodes. The root cause is still unclear to me.
I suspect the underlying ""webob.Request"" object which is used in Nova's
API, but I don't have proof for that.

By setting an empty '' as the body, Nova can successfully determine
the content_lenght of zero and fulfill the request. Additionally
to this change, it makes sense to check for None in the Nova API.

In change Ib62001c03e1e08f58cf0c6e0ba07a8879a584084 we switched the
rabbitmq queues HA mode from ha-all to ha-exactly. While this gives us a
nice performance boost with rabbitmq, it makes rabbit less resilient to
network glitches as we painfully found out via

Will propose another THT change to actually change the default to
-1 so we get this ha-mode:all by default.

A change was done in puppet-ironic:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/457478/

It broke TripleO upgrades because ironic-dbsync.log used to be owned by
root:root and now it's managed by ironic user in puppet-ironic, which is
good.

Because we want to support existing deployments, we need a way to handle
the new owership change, so let's do it in a upgrade task in
undercloud.py. Puppet will be able to run ironic-dbsync and we'll remove
this workaround after Pike release.

Cinder has a nice feature - cache for those images which are used as a

similar to image name.

These patch adds cleanup resource to remove such ""cache volumes"" since
they are redundant in case when original images are temporary and will
be removed while cleanuping.

For routed networks deployment we need DHCP relay support
in the undercloud DHCP agent to allow the initial bootstrap
of overcloud nodes to get ctlplane ip configuration from
DHCP before it is statically configured by os-net-config.

This adds a customized version of the linux/dhcp.py DHCP
agent shipped in Neutron.

The custom DHCP agent does two things:

  a) (Ab)use the description field of a subnet to carry
     identifier 'relay_enable_dhcp' and add logic to
     setup_dhcp_port() function so that it will only
     create ports for specific DHCP enabled subnet.
  b) Comment out the section that creates the link-local
     routes for each subnet. As this is done based on the
     assumption that subnets on a network is in the same
     L2 broadcast domain.

See [1] for comparison of DHCP opts and ports created in
the qdhcp namespace by this agent and the Neutron agent.
See [2] for the diff between this undercloud_dhcp.py agent
and the Neutron shipped agent. (Note, I had to make some
additional indentation changes to make pep8 happy.)

In before, we set the 'addresses' field of containers after we
mark the container as 'Created'. However, clients (i.e. Heat) might
try to retrieve the addresses right after the container is created.
As a result, an empty 'addresses' is returned which is suboptimal.

This commit move the setting of addresses before the first 'save'
so that users will get the addresses as long as the container is
of an active state.

As described in [1], it seems that mod_wsgi is not ""graceful"" reload
safe.  Upon re-init, it can end up in a segfault loop.

The ""reload"" (not *restart*) after setting up uwsgi was added with
I1d89be1f1b36f26eaf543b99bde6fdc5701474fe but not causing an issue
until uwsgi was enabled.

We do not notice in the gate, because the TLS setup ends up doing a
restart after this setup.  In the period between the
write_uwsgi_config and that restart, Apache is sitting in a segfault
loop, but we never noticed because we don't try talking to it.  Other
jobs that don't do any further apache configuration have started
failing, however.

Sidestep side effects of missing packages run-time
with host prep tasks. The reason for packages could be
missing is either being omitted because of containers
used, or optional components missing in the base images

images' size.

Illustrate as well the use case alternative to adding
optional components into the base overcloud images, if
we want them installed run-time.

It depends on pyghmi library (pure Python IPMI protocol implementation)

In order to avoid incompatible versions of virtualbmc and pyghmi
installed or required, which was already seen (ML thread [0]),
virtualbmc should also be present in g-r and u-c.

Versions specified in this patch are latest available at the time of
Mitaka release and are known to work with pyghmi version present in

The policy.json file is currently read continually by the
services and is not only read on service start. We therefore
cannot template directly to the file read by the service
(if the service is already running) because the new policies
may not be valid until the service restarts. This is
particularly important during a major upgrade. We therefore
only put the policy file in place after the service restart.

tasks to simplify them and reduce the tasks/code a little.

The callback modules have been available in neutron-lib since commit [1]
and are ready for consumption.

As the callback registry is implemented with a singleton manager
instance, sync complications can arise ensuring all consumers switch to
lib's implementation at the same time. Therefore this consumption has
been broken down:
1) Shim neutron's callbacks using lib's callback system and remove
existing neutron internals related to callbacks (devref, UTs, etc.).
2) Switch all neutron's callback imports over to neutron-lib's.
3) Have all sub-projects using callbacks move their imports over to use
neutron-lib's callbacks implementation.
4) Remove the callback shims in neutron-lib once sub-projects are moved
over to lib's callbacks.
5) Follow-on patches moving our existing uses of callbacks to the new
event payload model provided by neutron-lib.callback.events

This patch implements #2 from above, moving all neutron's callback
imports to use neutron-lib's callbacks.

There are also a few places in the UT code that still patch callbacks,
we can address those in step #4 which may need [2].

Mistral supports a positional argument('action_context') when
initilizing action. Rather than action input, if action needs extra
information for its running, action factory will fill it with a
dictionary containing contextual information like execution
identifier, workbook name and other that may be needed for some
specific action implementations.

It has some drawbacks for the following reasons:

* Using positional argument to pass system information is not a good
  idea.
* When users look at source coude of action implementation, positional
  argument will make them feel that they should pass something
  explicitly.
* It will make it complex to validate action input. Especially for
  openstack actions, the input validation is doing against actual
  client funtion instead of initialize function.

This patch adds a method in base action class that will tell if action
needs 'action_context' or not, which can be overridden by sub-classes.
Change 'action_context' as an optional argument.

ALso make some changes when dealing with action input.

This patch allows user to specify region name when running openstack
actions in the workflow, which means:

- User with credential in region-1 can specify region-2 for the whole
  workflow.
- User with credential in region-1 can specify different region in
  different tasks.

The region configuration in worfklow takes precedence over the

This commit switches devstack to use the published qcow2 cirros image
instead of the AMI version. Using AMI was mostly a historical artifact
dating pretty far back, but in the real world no one really uses AMI
images with openstack clouds. This change reflects that and also
enables tempest ro remove its deprecated config options for using AMI
as a fallback on misconfiguration (which was just there to support
devstack's defaults)

The lib/tempest side was changed to reflect the status of setting
images in this branch.

Drop the default value for worker-multiplier of 2.0; this

When the nova-api services starts from its own standalone binary it
registers itself in the services table. The original wsgi script in
nova/wsgi/nova-api.py did not, leading to the bug referenced below.

The new wsgi script at nova.api.openstack.compute.wsgi, modelled on
a similar thing used for the placement API, provides the necessary
service registration.

If a ServiceTooOld exception happens while trying to register the
service then a very simple (currently very stubby) application is
loaded instead of the compute api. This application returns a 500
and a message.

Some caveats/todos:

* wsgi apps managed under mod-wsgi (and presumably other containers)
  are not imported/compiled/run until the first request is made. In
  this case that means the service handling does not happen until
  that first request, somewhat defeating the purpose if the api is a
  bit idle.

This patch rehomes a bulk of neutron.api.v2.attributes into lib
with the following notable aspects:
- A new AttributeInfo class is available and wraps a resource's
attribute dict to provide operations with the attributes. The
class can be used as a operational wrapper on a dict of attrs, or
it an be used as a transport of attrs based on the consumer's need.
- A global singleton attribute map RESOURCES is available and
is initially populated with core resources.
- Some unit tests are beefed a little and make them more modular.
- Some huge comments into the devref.
- The fixture for API defs is updated to support backing up the
global RESOURCES dict.

The systemd unit 'TimeoutSec' value which controls the time
between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived
sessions to drain while preventing new ones from starting
before a restart or a stop.

The 'RestartSec' value which controls the time between the

150 seconds to 2 seconds to make the restart happen faster.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides
variables which use the config_template task to change template
defaults.

The systemd unit 'TimeoutSec' value which controls the time
between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived
sessions to drain while preventing new ones from starting
before a restart or a stop.

The 'RestartSec' value which controls the time between the
service stop and start when restarting has been reduced from
150 seconds to 2 seconds to make the restart happen faster.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides
variables which use the config_template task to change template
defaults.

Change I4f97c05e2dec610af22a5150dd27696e1d767896 worked around
a change introduced in libvirt 1.3.3 where the script path on
a LibvirtConfigGuestInterface could not be the emptry string
because libvirt would literally take that as the path and couldn't
resolve it, when in fact it used to indicate to libvirt that the
script path is a noop. This has been fixed in libvirt 3.1.

On Ubuntu with libvirt<1.3.3, if the script path is None then
it defaults to /etc/qemu-ifup which is blocked by AppArmor.

So this change adds a conditional check when setting the script
path value based on the libvirt version so we can straddle releases.

In db API when we process filters, we didn't
use deepcopy. In cases of ""tags"" and ""not-tags""
we used pop to get the first tag, filtered out
results, and then joined with other tags for
later filtering. When we did pop(), the original
value was deleted, the key ""tags""/""not-tags"" remains.

In the cell scenario, both single cell(we will
query cell0 and the other cell) and multicell,
as we have to query all the cells in a loop and
the tags list in the filter will keep popping,
this will lead to either a HTTP 500 error(popping
from an empty list) or incorrect result(when
number of tags in the list is larger than cell
number, no HTTP 500 will show, but the filter
results for each cell will be different as
each loop will pop one tag).

Conflicts:
      nova/tests/functional/regressions/test_bug_1682693.py

NOTE(mriedem): The conflict on the functional regression test
is due to I65bdfadd406368775c794ee4d8a16302a8a134bc not being
backported to Newton. That was not backported simply because it
relies on too many fixtures to stub out a real cells environment
that trying to get it to work in Newton is not worth it. This
fix is still unit tested which is sufficient.

Starting from version 1.3.5, Libvirt allows to set a vlan tag for macvtap
passthrough mode on SR-IOV VFs. Libvirt also removes any vlan tags that

In order to support the older libvirt versions, this code will make
the behaviour backward compatible by checking the libvirt version.
This can be completely removed once the minimum libvirt version will increase.

The systemd unit 'TimeoutSec' value which controls the time
between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived
sessions to drain while preventing new ones from starting
before a restart or a stop.

The 'RestartSec' value which controls the time between the
service stop and start when restarting has been reduced from
150 seconds to 2 seconds to make the restart happen faster.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides
variables which use the config_template task to change template
defaults.

This creates a specific slice which all OpenStack services will operate
from. By creating an independent slice these components will be governed
away from the system slice allowing us to better optimise resource
consumption.

See the following for more information on slices:

* https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.slice.html

See for following for more information on resource controls:

* https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html

Tools like ``systemd-cgtop`` and ``systemd-cgls`` will now give us
insight into specific processes, process groups, and resouce consumption
in ways that we've not had access to before. To enable some of this reporting
the accounting options have been added to the [Service] section of the unit
file.

""Download OpenStack RC"" buttons.
This commit packs them into a single menu.

To complete the goal, a new option called ""table_actions_menu_label""
is newly introduced to DataTable.

Also the condition to disable an action dropdown menu is changed
so that the action dropdown is not disabled when ""multi_select""
feature is not used in a corresponding table.
Otherwise, the dropdown menu is always disabled and there is
no way to enable it in a DataTable with multi_select=False.

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a
known bug [1] in Ansible's apt module which does not
update the cache properly if the cache update and the
install are combined in a single task.

The systemd unit 'TimeoutSec' value which controls the time
between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived
sessions to drain while preventing new ones from starting
before a restart or a stop.

The 'RestartSec' value which controls the time between the
service stop and start when restarting has been reduced from
150 seconds to 2 seconds to make the restart happen faster.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides
variables which use the config_template task to change template
defaults.

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a
known bug [1] in Ansible's apt module which does not
update the cache properly if the cache update and the
install are combined in a single task.

This patch is adopting the neutron-lib hacking rules in networking-ovn.
By doing that we get rid of the N531 check which was asserting that log
messages had a translation hint and the i18n team already decided that
we should not translate logs, see [0] for more context.

The patch also fixes the H301 occurences (One import per line) and
ignores N535 (Usage of Python eventlet module not allowed) because we
still use eventlet in some places.

It is possible that _update_port_binding_for_instance() is called
without a migration object, such as when a user unshelves an instance.

If the instance has a port(s) with a PCI device binding, the current
logic extracts a pci mapping from old to new devices from the migration
object and migration context.  If a 'new' device is not found in the
PCI mapping, an exception is thrown.

In the case of an unshelve, there is no migration object (or migration
context), and as such we have an empty pci mapping.

This fix will only check for a new device if we have a migration object.

The systemd unit 'TimeoutSec' value which controls the time
between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived
sessions to drain while preventing new ones from starting
before a restart or a stop.

The 'RestartSec' value which controls the time between the
service stop and start when restarting has been reduced from
150 seconds to 2 seconds to make the restart happen faster.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides
variables which use the config_template task to change template
defaults.

When adding multiple subnets on a single network the
DHCP agent will set dhcp-options to advertise
""on-link""/""same-segment"" classless static routes to
all the subnets. This change adds a new Network model
attribute, 'onlink_subnet_routes', that allows the
operator to disable the creation of the ""on-link""
routes. Default value is True.

According to RFC 3442 configuring the DHCP server to
specify these routes is optional.

 Local Subnet Routes

     In some cases more than one IP subnet may be configured on a link.
     In such cases, a host whose IP address is in one IP subnet in the
     link could communicate directly with a host whose IP address is in a
     different IP subnet on the same link. In cases where a client is
     being assigned an IP address on an IP subnet on such a link, for each
     IP subnet in the link other than the IP subnet on which the client
     has been assigned the DHCP server MAY be configured to specify a
     router IP address of 0.0.0.0.

We should use a service account to make requests to external
vendordata services. This something which we got wrong in the
newton cycle, and discussed how to resolve at the ocata summit.

It is intended that this fix be backported to newton as well.

There is a sample external vendordata server which has been
tested with this implementat at:

   https://github.com/mikalstill/vendordata

There was a conflict in nova/conf/__init__.py which I resolved
with my thinking brain.

The callback modules have been available in neutron-lib since commit [1]
and are ready for consumption.

As the callback registry is implemented with a singleton manager
instance, sync complications can arise ensuring all consumers switch to
lib's implementation at the same time. Therefore this consumption has
been broken down:
1) Shim neutron's callbacks using lib's callback system and remove
existing neutron internals related to callbacks (devref, UTs, etc.).
2) Switch all neutron's callback imports over to neutron-lib's.
3) Have all sub-projects using callbacks move their imports over to use
neutron-lib's callbacks implementation.
4) Remove the callback shims in neutron-lib once sub-projects are moved
over to lib's callbacks.
5) Follow-on patches moving our existing uses of callbacks to the new
event payload model provided by neutron-lib.callback.events

This patch implements #1 from above, shimming neutron's callbacks and
removing devref + UTs. Rather than shimming using debtcollector, this
patch leaves callback constants as-is, and simply references the lib
class/function in its respective neutron callback module. This allows
consumers to test callback types without changing code. For example,
an except block block like that below continues to work even though
the raised exception now lives in lib::

try:
     neutron_cb_registry.notify(...)
except neutron_cb_exceptions.CallbackFailure:
     handle_exception()

In addition this patch contains minor UT updates to support the shim
approach.

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a
known bug [1] in Ansible's apt module which does not
update the cache properly if the cache update and the
install are combined in a single task.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides
variables which use the config_template task to change template
defaults.

The callback system in neutron has moved to neutron-lib and hence
consumers need to follow suit.

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a
known bug [1] in Ansible's apt module which does not
update the cache properly if the cache update and the
install are combined in a single task.
