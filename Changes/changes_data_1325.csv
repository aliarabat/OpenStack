was used for getting networking configuration into the baremetal nodes,

While it is true that there are currently no second-preimage attacks
against MD5, there are other attacks that weaken it, and it's not like
MD5 is going to get any stronger.

Now you can give a different hash algorithm to `swift-ring-builder
create` on the command line, and all your object paths will get hashed
with the new algorithm. On-disk filenames will reflect the new hash.

You can't change an existing ring's hash algorithm. I mean, you *can*,
but you'll lose all your data.

This works by having the proxy (a) pay attention to the ring's hash
algorithm when hashing paths, and (b) extract the hash algorithm from
the rings and pass it to the backend servers via HTTP headers so they
can hash paths the same way. If the header is missing, the backends
will default to md5, so upgrades of existing clusters will work.

Note that there's a use of MD5 in Ring.get_more_nodes() that's been
left there intentionally. It doesn't affect on-disk placement, only
handoff selection, and it operates on the partition number that comes
from the configurable hash anyway. Changing that wouldn't actually
gain us anything.

Note: doesn't work on py2.6, it seems. Who knew?

It is possible to clone a volume with a size greater than
the source volume. When using the SolidFire driver, the volume size
was not passed in the call made to the SolidFire API when
cloning a volume.

It resulted in a cloned volume having the same size as the source
volume but the correct size in the Cinder database.

This changes makes sure the cloned volume has the correct size
by explicitly passing the requested size when calling
the SolidFire API and cloning the volume.

The flavors.add_flavor_access and flavors.remove_flavor_access
require admin privilege in DB level but the policy doesn't
require it and the exception isn't catched in the api. So the
bug arise. The privilege check in DB level is not necessary,
but it need more tests and can be remove in other patch or
blue-print.

This use extension_authorizer instead of soft_extension_authorizer
in the action of flavor_access, in order to raise exception.

In OpenStack we don't allow merge commits, and it probably isn't what
we would want even if we did allow them. Also, if we are on a branch,
we are going to assume the user does not want to even attempt a pull.

If the user is on master, and has diverged, we want to offer them a
likely next step, which is to rebase on origin/master.

In this patch, the following module test coverage improved to 100%

Since the module defines an abstract class, it is important to
change the abstract method body from using ""pass"" to comments so
that the test coverage can possibly to be ushed to 100%. If the
abstract method body is the ""pass"" statement, then the test code
coverage can not be possibly 100% since abstract class can not
be instantiated, thus can not be tested.

This patch implements flaper87's suggestion from several weeks ago
to either define ancillary storage driver methods in the ABC, or
to treat them as ""semi-private"" and rename them to include an
underscore in the front.

I took the one method that was implemented by both storage drivers, first(),
and formally defined it in the ABC. The remaining mongo helper methods
that support other controller classes within the same driver (i.e.,
""friend"" classes) were given the canonical ""_"" prefix.

When unshelving a shelved server, nova-scheduler fails because nova-conductor
of current unshelve feature passes an empty list as filter_properties, and
nova-scheduler handles it as a dict.

To fix the problem, this patch changes the filter_properties to an empty dict.

The test_list_servers_negative tests require that there are no existing
instances in the database when they run and will fail if any are found
under the primary/alternate user/tenant.

When running tempest with allow_tenant_isolation=false on a slower
system, there is a race where instances from previous tests are still
cleaning up in the background and cause test_list_servers_negative to
fail in setup.

There may be cases when the call to RetrievePropertiesEx may have missing
data. That is, the propSet field may be missing. In this case the missing
field will be logged. This will help with troubleshooting the problem.

Fields may be missing due to one of the following reasons:
 - SystemError if there was some unknown problem reading the value
 - NoPermission if the logged in session did not have permission to read
   the value

The propSet attribute is marked as optional in the API documentation so this
should have been anticipated and this can be interpreted as a bug in the

This patch fixes a proxy bug that allows queues to be duplicated
across partitions. This happens because the catalogue isn't checked
for project/queue existence before forwarding requests to a marconi
partition.

Caching is also added to queue on_put to quickly determine if a
particular project/queue exists.

A unit test suite is added that verifies that this has been fixed, as
well as checking various properties on the queue resource.

first error, so that errors don't compound and result in confusing error
messages.  If one of these helper scripts aborts, stack.sh itself will
also abort in the usual manner.

Due to the change in behaviour, tweak some mv invocations to ensure that
they don't trigger false failures.

As with stack.sh itself, also enable xtrace so we can see exactly what's
happening.  In particular this allows us to see the cause of any
premature termination due to a command failing whilst errexit is
enabled.

openSUSE's python-virtualenv rpm depends on the python-pip rpm, but
tools/install_pip.sh prefers to deinstall the latter (if installed) and
install pip directly from upstream source instead.

This deinstallation of python-pip will break if attempted via rpm -e,
since rpm does not transitively remove dependents (in this case
python-virtualenv).  In contrast, ""zypper rm"" does, so we switch to
that.

It is safe to remove the python-virtualenv package, since stack.sh will
install virtualenv via pip instead.

Resource limit checks on a compute manager are based on the
contents of filter_properites['limits'].   This in turn is
populated by the scheduler after the host has been selected by
scheduler.utils.populate_filter_properties.   The limits value
is taken from the host_state, which is maintained as a local data
in the host manager. The host_state limits values are populated
by the various filters, for example the ram filter sets
limits['memory_mb'] based on its configuration.

In the case of scheduling to a forced host the filters are
bypassed, so the contents of the host_state['limits'] value
depends on whether the scheduler has already placed a non-forced
instance onto that host (and thus run the filters to populate the
limits).   If it has then the compute manager will impose the
limits, if it hasn't then the limits will be empty and there will
be no check.

As forcing bypasses the filters and is a privileged operation the
limits should always be cleared in the filter_properties in this
case to avoid the limit check on the compute manager.

This makes the RPC version support three elements, adding a ""revision""
in addition to the major and minor version. The revision would always
be zero for the master branch of a service, but could be incremented
for stable versions. This provides us some room to backport fixes
that affect RPC versions in such a way that would avoid breaking
the version lineage for systems running stable versions that may
some day be involved in a rolling upgrade to a version from master.

I didn't find any tests for version_is_compatible(), so I added
some for existing version scenarios, as well as new ones with
revisions. They also serve to validate that this doesn't break
anything for code using two-element versions (the expectation is that
two-element versions will still be used everywhere until a third
is needed).

wait_for() can actually be made a separate shell script to make it possible

Libvirt driver would try to decide the device bus (in case it was not
specified or not a valid value) based on the device name. This can fail,
but the possible failure wasn't taken into account.

This patch makes sure that if the bus cannot be decided base on the disk
bus passed - it will be decided based on the device type which is always
present.

The ""source cloudprompt"" step is messing up the numbering of the

indentation on the command (which I assume should remain commented
out since it's only supposed to be run once), so this just adds
indentation.

A previous change to enable secifying size for cloned volumes
created introduced a bug that breaks the ability to create-snapshots
when using the SolidFire driver
(CID: I5628c7fa922780d6b0601e2daa79310a61085edc).

The problem is that we use a shared method in the SF driver for both
create-clone and create-snapshot, the added change only considers the
clone case and does a get ref['size'] but in the case of snapshots
this needs to be ref['volume_size'].

and only refer to by name when this is required.

To fulfill this concept assign each task an identity
where the identity is composed of (name, uuid, version)
where the first two elements are required and the version
is not required.

The tempest debug info on test case failure feature will require,
sudo permissions. So tempest will run in the 'root' user name,
instead of 'stack'.

Tempest is going to run commands as root in order to gather more,
information about tricky failures. The results will be logged to the
regular logging targets.

devstack-vm-gate.sh removes the ALL command sudo permission from the
stack user in order to avoid introducing root-wrap related bugs.
Only the ``foo``-rootwrap commands remains allowed to the ``stack`` user.

Running tempest as root looks strange, but it does not expected to cause
issues, otherwise a much more complex logic required.

The test_list_servers_by_changes_since test fails when running with
allow_tenant_isolation=false because there is an arbitrary 2 minutes to
determine the timedelta for the changes-since in the query. That doesn't
work when the servers created in the test are all under the same
user/tenant because the tearDown doesn't block until the servers are
deleted.

This patch makes the timedelta code smarter in that it narrows the
changes-since down to when the test case started setting up the servers
for the test and when it does the query.

Previously to run a flow client code had to put together the flow,
an engine, logbook, flowdetail, and storage backend. This commit
adds two helper functions, run() and load(), so that simplest usecase
now looks like

    taskflow.engines.run(flow)

Client code may also provide configuration for storage and engine if
needed, but if not needed it just works with defaults.

Engines are loaded via stevedore, as drivers in 'taskflow.engines'
backend. Now three entry points are defined in that namespace:
- 'default', for SingleThreadedActionEngine, used by default;
- 'serial', as another synonym for SingleThreadedActionEngine;
- 'parallel', for MultiThreadedActionEngine.

with Timer() as timer:

The SQLAlchemy engine dialect provides an is_disconnect() function
that returns True when the exception is due to the server going
down. Use this in the checkout listener.

The code in the SQLAlchemy MySQL dialect uses
 errnos = (2006, 2013, 2014, 2045, 2055, 2048) and
 exceptions = (self.dbapi.OperationalError, self.dbapi.InterfaceError)

(See
https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/blob/master/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/mysql/mysqlconnector.py#L113 )

So the new check is similar but the SQLAlchemy MySQL dialect is
probably correct here.

Note that this can also work for other database engines.

this test has very poor definition of initial conditions, so can
very easily fail if the nodes are a little slow so the servers
might have been created outside the time window. Also setupClass
really doesn't ensure the initial conditions for this test, as
it ignores some errors.

Remove the test so it doesn't cause issues in the gate, this really
should go back into the unit tests instead.

The problem was that queue_name wasn't being validated before being
used to construct log messages. Also, I found that the regex used to
validate queue names was not reliable and needed to be rewritten.

Upon further investigation, I also discovered that the queue name
wasn't being validated for all routes that included it. This was
also fixed. Validating all input is a basic best practice re
application security.

Along the way, I edited the validation error messages for clarity,
and relocated the ValidationFailed exception since it is only used
by the transport driver.

delegations) were ignored. This commit fixes that by creating NS records in
Designate for delegation NS.

Before, if creating a record failed, the zone would be left in a half-created
state. With this error handling, if creating a record fails, the zone is deleted
and the original exception is raised.

Use horizon.tables package instead for drawing the tables (old term is
datagrid).  Now columns attribute is configurable in Service
YAML-markup (it should be consistent with initial data for

horizon.tables (if this can be done at all) - this eliminates need in
custom js-code which adds and deletes table rows on client-side.

this call into a synchronous one. The wrapper assumes that the called function
immediately returns an object for which it takes some time to get to the

blueprint rbd-stripe-parameters

When creating an RBD volume, various command line options can be specified;
two of these relate to data striping and are stripe_count and stripe_unit.

stripe_count: specifies the number of objects to stripe over before looping back to the first object.
stripe_unit: specifies the stripe unit size in bytes

Takes the RBD stripe parameters from python-cinderclient and simply passes them through the many
methods calls present within the files below:

cinder/api/v1/volumes.py: retrieves and enters stripe_count and stripe_unit to volume_api.create

cinder/volume/api.py: create method parameters modified to include stripe_count and stripe_unit;
these are also included in the 'create_what' directory to be entered into the database.

sqlalchemy/models.py: ensure Cinder knows stripe_count and stripe_unit columns are present

cinder/volume/flows/create_volume/__init__.py: ExtractVolumeRequestTask.__call_ method parameters
modified to include stripe_count and stripe_unit etc.
stripe parameters entered in the database within EntryCreateTask.__call__

Most modifications are made within the rbd driver cinder/volume/drivers/rbd.py:
* Temporarily reverted to the older method of creating RBD volumes as passing stripe parameters
using self.rbd.RBD().create results in the error InvalidArgument: error creating image.
* As such the size variable has been modified so the correct size of volume is created when using
the older method of volume creation.
* The volume creation unit test with test_rbd.py has been temporarily disabled to account for the
 older method of volume creation

When the error passing stripe parameters to self.rbd.RBD().create is solved, the most recent version
of creating RBD volumes will be adopted and unit tests can be re-enabled.

To allow the switchable fields to appear via Horizon when creating a volume, cinder/volume/manager.py
has been modified to create a volume type cinder.volume.drivers.rbd.rbddriver when only the RBD driver
is in use and is deleted otherwise. The user selects this volume type and can then enter the stripe_count
and stripe_unit parameters which are then used to create the volume.

This implementation requires:

The driver was earlier performing create from a source volume and create from
a snapshot point by copying the source volume container folder.

This is not valid in case of vSAN datastore where the volume data is not a
'file' in the container folder unlike VMFS/NFS datastores. So copying folder
will only copy descriptor file and hence the source and cloned volume will
end up writing to the same data location, eventually corrupting it.

The fix is to copy only the VMDK file (descriptor + data) and not the entire
container folder. The implementation does the following:
1. Create a volume backing
2. Delete the current VMDK
3. Make a copy of source volume's VMDK file to the destination using virtual
   disk manager. In case of create from snapshot, we copy the VMDK file
   corresponding to the snapshot point.

Per feedback received on other patch sets, an example key manager
driver is required to support ephemeral storage encryption and
Cinder volume encryption -- see
* https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/encrypt-cinder-volumes
* https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/encrypt-ephemeral-storage
The ConfKeyManager class reads its key from the project's
configuration file and provides this key for *all* requests. As
such, this key manager is insecure but allows the aforementioned
encryption features to be used without further integration effort.

To clarify the above statements, the configuration-based key
manager uses a single, fixed key. When used to encrypt data (e.g.,
by the Cinder volume encryption feature), the encryption provides
limited protection for the confidentiality of data. For example,
data cannot be read from a lost or stolen disk, and a volume's
contents cannot be reconstructed if an attacker intercepts the iSCSI
traffic between the compute and storage host. If the key is ever
compromised, then any data encrypted with the key can be decrypted.

This commit copies the ConfKeyManager class from Nova as well as
synchronizing changes with the key manager interface in Nova.

Set the DHCP timeout to 120 seconds during virtual machine installation.
Some users failed to run devstack, due to a low DHCP timeout setting.
The default value is 60 seconds. This change sets the value to 120 secs,
that should give enough time for most people.

Adds the ExternalIpAddressExhaustedClient exception so
a more specific exception than NeutronClientException is raised
when IPs run out. This will allow for better exception
handling in Nova.

Storwize family storage does not allow host identifier start with
a numeric number. Otherwise cinder initialize_connection() API will
throw exception due to such invalid host name in the connector. The fix
is to add a '_' symbol as prefix if the host identifier in connector
starts with non-alphabet letters.
