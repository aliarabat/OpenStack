Ran 23 tests in 19.260s

Also remove unneeded randomness.

The replicator already supports --devices and --partitions to restrict
its operation to a subset of devices and partitions. However,
operators don't always want to replicate a partition in all policies
since different policies (usually) have different rings.

For example, if I know that policy 0's partition 1234 is has no
replicas on primary nodes due to over-aggressive rebalancing, I really
want to find a node where the partition isa and make the replicator
push it onto the primaries. However, if I haven't been messing with
policy 1's ring, its partition 1234 is fine. With the existing
replicator args, I get both or neither; this commit lets me get just
the useful one.

This decorator can be used to commit failing tests while they are still
in development. It can also be used by people to show how an issue can
be reproduced without them having to make the code changes necessary to
make the test pass.

This is nicer than just raising TestSkipped because there is a built in
reminder to remove the decorator when the test starts passing.

Logging from oslo interfaces directly with the logging stdlib from

But, even it's an alias, we still should be stick to warning() because
although warn() was kept as backwards compatibility in PY3 it's not even
documented there[1] and they recommended to use warning()
[1] https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html

Replaced the missing log.warn to log.warning and cleared the checking.

it's necessary that we don't emit a DROP CONSTRAINT

this command.

The drop_all_objects() is added as a first class element
here and is also added to the _cleanup() method of

A 'gabbi' tox target is added which runs a declarative HTTP tests
described in YAML files in 'ceilometer/tests/gabbi/gabbits' and loaded by
'ceilometer/tests/gabbi/test_gabbi.py'. These are driven by the 'gabbi'
python package (available from PyPI).

tox and testr are configured to start and run the tests efficiently:

* a mongodb server, using multiple databases, is made available
* the API wsgi application is used directly via 'wsgi-intercept', no
  web server required
* each YAML file is run as a sequence and where number of processors
  allows, in a different test process
* individual tests can be requested in the usual way:

    tox -egabbi -- <test pattern>

  If this is done, all the tests prior to the one requested, from
  its YAML file, will be run as ordered prerequisites.
* tox targets that already run the tests in ceilometer/tests will
  also discover gabbi tests. If there is no mongodb, they will
  be skipped.

A ConfigFixture does the necessary work of adjusting the configuration
and pipeline to use the mongodb database and nothing else. An
internal InterceptFixture uses wsgi-intercept to access the
ceilometer API. Each yaml file has its own intercepted host.

Fixtures are implemented as nested context managers that are declared
per YAML file, see ceilometer/gabbi/fixtures.py and fixtures-samples.yaml
for an example of how they can be used. Every yaml file uses at
least ConfigFixture.

YAML files can use a variety of strategies for formatting requests
and evaluating the correctness of response. See:
http://gabbi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/format.html

The YAML files included here test simple API features for creating and
retrieving samples. Subsequent patches can (and should) create
additional YAML files to describe more complex scenarios that cover
the entire API (for example alarms are not touched at all by this
patch).

Currently, Nova premises a situation which iSCSI target is not changed
before and after live migration. Therefore, if destination node has
different iSCSI target, the live migration fails in current Nova's
specification. However, if each compute node uses same iSCSI target,
each compute node recognizes all volumes in the iSCSI target and this
is undesirable situation from the view point of security.

Therefore, this spec proposes to support live migration of instances with
Cinder volumes among compute nodes that need to log into different
iSCSI targets to access the volumes.

For your reference, if iSCSI storages have features to manage visibility
of LUNs for each initiator within one iSCSI target, using same iSCSI
target for each compute node is not a problem. But general iSCSI storages
don't have such kind features, therefore they need this feature to
support live migration.

If metadata is not valid dictionary then glance-api
throws 'internal server' error.

Validating metadata JSON file using jsonschema library
at configuration stage and caching metadata and using it
directly when new image being added.
Metadata JSON file requires 'id' and 'mountpoint' keys
to be 'string'. If value of 'id' and 'mountpoint' are not
string then it will raise ValidationError error.
After getting exception during json data validation,
'BadStoreConfiguration' exception will be raised.

If metadata file is list of dicts containing multiple mountpoints
then returned image metadata as dict containing exact mountpoint
where image is stored.

If image path do not starts with any of the 'mountpoint' provided
in metadata JSON file then error is logged and empty
dictionary is returned to glance api.

DocImpact:
Metadata JSON schema file should be valid object. This JSON object
should contain keys 'id', 'mountpoint' and value of both keys
should be string.

Example of valid metadata JSON:

1. If there is only one mountpoint-
{
  ""id"": ""f0781415-cf81-47cd-8860-b83f9c2a415c"",
  ""mountpoint"": ""/var/lib/glance/images/""

2. If there are more than one mountpoints-
[
  {
    ""id"": ""f0781415-cf81-47cd-8860-b83f9c2a415c"",
    ""mountpoint"": ""/var/lib/glance/images1/""

Changing differencing vhd/x images parent path fails because of a
wrong XML item check. This causes merging vhd/x images to fail
as well.

This bug was introduced by this patch:
I18b6a1adf398a5fc8f75d0f6276f6896846dbf3a

The issue is that XML elements with no subelements will test as
False.

This patch solves the bug by properly handling the vhd info XML.

Currently live migration operations will be allowed to continue

Add a configuration parameter allowing the live migration time
to be capped, defaulting to 10 minutes.

If a migration takes longer than this, it'll probably never going
to complete in reasonable time. Nova needs to be enhanced so that
it monitors live migration progress and increases max downtime,
or increases available bandwidth to force convergance, or even
pause the VM to make it non-live.

The Manila test module uses a class called StubOutForTesting, which
is an awkward holdover from when the unit tests were using Mox.
Alex wrote a more elegant and capable mocker method,
manila.test.TestCase.mock_object, in the Cinder project which we
have now added to Manila. So to remove the duplicate functionality
and legacy code, all references to self.stubs.Set() in the Manila
tests should be replaced with self.mock_object() and any related
dead code should be removed.

Our existing default (replicas == 1) means that no data
(or copies) is being replicated in a multi-node Swift
environment. This seems like a bad production default
setting and could easily slip by if not set.

Setting it to 3 shouldn't hurt anything and seems to follow
suit with what several production installers (based around Puppet)
actually use. If using an installation with less than 3 swift
nodes I believe swift will do its best, and still work fine.

FWIW I noticed this when testing a multi-node Puppet swift
installation and was surprised when I didn't see any *data

In doing the Puppet version of the Swift role I noticed
4 parameters which we apply to storage nodes which should
not be required. This patch drops the following parameters
from the swift-storage and swift-storage-puppet nested
stacks which should not be required.

 1) ControllerIP: There is no reason a storage node should need
 the IP address of the controller. The swift proxy would need
 this information in order to be able to contact keystone.
 This swift-proxy is not installed on storage nodes so we can
 drop the parameter here.

 2) NeutronEnableTunnelling: There is no reason for Neutron
 to be installed on Swift storage nodes. No need to create
 an OVS bridge either.

 3) NeutronNetworkType: Similar to above. No neutron requirements
 exist here so this parameter is not required.

 4) Password: This only applies to the the swift-proxy which is

VMware store retries to upload the image data but fails when

This patch adds support for a Swift proxy and storage
node on the controller.

The implementation is fairly straightforward with the
exception of building the ring. I've followed an
upstream TripleO model here where we build the
actual ring on each node (rather than build once
and rsync). This works because Heat will always
know all the devices ahead of time. In the future
when we have Heat breakpoints it might be possible
to consider optimizing this by generating the ring
once and then rsyncing to all the nodes.

The ringbuilder logic is executed as a seperate
Heat software deployment. On the controller the ring
is executed in between the base service (mysql/rabbit)
and OpenStack service steps. This is to ensure the
ring exists before the Swift proxy is started.
Having the ringbuilder.pp logic as a separate software
config should allow us to reuse it for the Storage
node role.

It should also be noted that swift.zones support is
added here but we are missing an upstream Heat
template change in order for it to be wired
in properly. See: I0e0f5189da1575f2e1ed7fba4bbbe13a8fbf6221

Likewise we need to properly wire in SwiftRingBuild as well.
See: I01311ec3ca265b151f8740bf7dc57cdf0cf0df6f
The underlying puppet ringbuilder code is already wired
to support this change when it lands.

As is this works today and will provide a working Overcloud
Swift-proxy/storage node config. Will follow this up with
a related Swift storage node patch which should allow
puppet to be used for configuration on the storage nodes
as well...

In I250dc1a8c02626cf7d1a5d2ce92706504ec0c7de we split
out just the Controller software config in an effort
to provide hooks for alternate implementations (puppet).

This sort of worked but caused quirky ordering issues
with signal handling. It also causes problems for Tuskar
which would prefer to think of these nested stacks and
not have us split out just the software configs like this.

This patch moves all the compute related stuff for
our two implementations:

compute.yaml: is used by os-apply-config (uses the
tripleo-image-elements)
compute-puppet.yaml: uses stackforge puppet-* modules for
configuration

By duplicating the entire compute in this manner we make
it much easier to create dependencies and implement proper
signal handling. The only (temporary) downside is the duplication
of parameters most of which will eventually go away when we move
using the global parameters via Heat environment files instead.

* Added 'wait_rabbitmq_is_up' method to fuel_web_client.

  1) This method checks, if pacemaker promoted rabbitmq service on
  some node as the Master, and if the rabbitmq cluster is accepting
  connections (by checking 'haproxy' backend status).
  After 1800 sec the method raises a timeout error.

  2) If rabbitmq has started then wait for 120 sec to make
  sure that pacemaker won't perform re-assembling the rabbitmq
  cluster by some reason. Yet if the rabbitmq ran away then repeat
  the 1) and wait again. After 3 times of running/stopping the
  rabbitmq cluster, the method raises an error.

* Added 'wait_rabbitmq_is_up' to the test 'ceph_ha_restart'

* Added 'remote_install_pkg' method to perform installing packages
  on any node of the cluster.

Log a warning when a node failes to match a hardware profile instead of
raising an exception. I don't consider a failed match to be an
exception. In fact, it's something that's probably going to happen quite
frequently.

The current behavior of using an exception here causes 2 other
undeseriable side effects:

- ironic-discoverd treats the discovery process as failed and keeps the
  node powered on indefinitely.
- The discovery ramdisk receives an invalid response back from
  ironic-discoverd and drops down to a troubleshooting console.

An alternative way to handle this more gracefully would be to perhaps
update the Ironic data with an empty hardware dict, and record a Null
value for the matched profile. But, I think just using an Log message is
sufficient for now.

Currently we are installing the latest version of python-openstackclient
in stable/juno devstack meaning if the latest python-openstackclient has
conflicting dependencies things will break.

This is needed before we can pin all of stable/juno global requirements.

Pin python-openstackclient client version to 1.0.1, The same version as
in icehouse.

Since split between AWS and OS WaitConidtion/Volume resources unit tests
for those resources were not running as they were not discovered.

During this time some changes were merged that actually broke some
tests (mostly the mocking) so this patch fixes those broken tests too.

Some AWS WaitConidtion tests were testing the handle_update method,
which has no sense now as it no longer returns a TaskRunner instance.
These tests were modified to use the general resource.update method.

One test in AWS volumes is modified to use mocked ServerConstraint,
which is added to base TestCase as are stubs for other constraints.
Another test in AWS volumes was using a dumb monkey-patching
instead of proper mock, leading to clashes during concurrent test runs.

Problem:
If a nested stack has no resources, then we do not get
a ""nested"" link in the resource information returned by
our API.

Why?
In engine/api.py we have:

if (hasattr(resource, 'nested') and callable(resource.nested) and
            resource.nested()):
         res[rpc_api.RES_NESTED_STACK_ID] = dict(resource.nested().identifier())

The problem with this is the python definition of False, from the docs:

""instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a __nonzero__()
 or __len__() method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool
 value False. [1]""

So if you have a stack with zero resources (len() returns 0), the
stack will be False :-O

Solution:
Use ""if stack is not None:"" instead of ""if stack"".

Whilst a previous patch fixed the main problem in using the keystone v2
client these references were missed. The v2 client has not been updated
to use the session so it has no session attribute that can be relied
upon.

In this patch I've left a FIXME to make this session object more global.
My hope is that when all these smaller issues have been eradicated we
can come back and make a more consistent authentication workflow for all
these clients.

This patch introduces a new module for hosting NSX DB model classes,
and populates it with models for the 'network gateway' extension,
which are then removed from the model hosting the network gateway
mixin.

This patch is part of a set of minor refactorings in the NSX plugin
which will then lead to a semi-full decomposition by the end of
the Kilo release cycle.

This patch implements the capability to pin package versions using apt
preferences. This prevents the unwitting upgrading of packages when
doing general packages deployment and maintenance.

The list of packages and versions can be overridden using user
variables.

For each item in 'apt_pinned_packages'
 - package: package name
 - version: package version to pin
 - priority: pin priority (default is 900, over 1000 will make apt force
   a downgrade)

The patch also removes the usage of the LXC PPA - it was only deployed
if the operating system was < 14.04 and the reality is that the entire
project has not been tested on a platform < 14.04. The removal of the
PPA is thus to reduce confusion.

It also includes a known set of packages which are important to pin for
a stable OpenStack deployment. The packages pinned use sources and
version which should be available for a typical 'Long Term Support'
time-frame.

Fully decouple the versions needed for tempest from the underlying
system. This will help make it possible to pin library versions on
stable branches to the library version used when the branch was
cut, while allowing master global requirements to move beyond that
version.

Note: We previously enabled sitepackages everywhere to avoid
recompiling indirect dependencies that were pulled in via the
pythonclients. To address this we were working on removing the CLI tests

because there is no easy way for mysqld to efficiently select only

This is a resubmission of the reverted patch with the broken call
site fixed.

This clean up is intended to reduce complexity and confusion about
the use of objects, and in the future, objects will no longer
give the option of passing a context to create/destroy/refresh/save.
Instead, the context manager obj_as_admin() should be used to perform
an action with an elevated context.

libraries, so we should migrate to new import path.

This patch applies new paths for:
- oslo.config
- oslo.db
- oslo.messaging
- oslo.serialization
- oslo.utils

Hacking check will be added in Neutron once all *aas repositories are converted
to namespace-less imports.

This commit adds some basic functionality to rpc_maas_tool.py to nuke
old alarms that should no longer exist.  These include alarms containing:

WSREP_CLUSTER_SIZE
WSREP_LOCAL_STATE_COMMENT

mem_alarm

We limit deletion against alarms that also include
rabbit_mq_container or galera_container.

We also delete any checks that were created without filesystem patch
included.  Note that remove-defunct-checks should not be run against
an icehouse installation as the change to check name was not backported
there.

The floating ip namespace is an important concept that links a DVR
enabled L3 agent to DVR routers.  The namespace is shared by all of
the dvr routers on a compute host connected to the same network.  It
is managed by the dvr enabled agent.  Hence, it should be known to the
agent and made available to the DVR routers as well.  This calls for a
proper encapsulation of this functionality in a class which can be
accessed by both the agent and the routers.

In trying to tease floating ip functionality out of the L3 agent and
in to the new router classes, I found it very difficult to do because
the logic around the floating ip namespace has not yet been properly
encapsulated.

When creating block devices for the first time on instance create - we
need to consider some things we would normally not care about, such as
that it is possible to have block devices specified in the boot request

name.

Database API method block_device_mapping_update_or_create has the logic
to allow for this so we want objects to call it when needed. We use the
existing add an update_or_create method that does most of the things
create() does but calls a different db_api method, so we use the
existing code that we extracted into a private method with a flag.

Ironic Conductor Manager now waits on its greenpool workers to finish
before del_host completes. This will ensure more-correct behavior, as
well as giving workers the opportunity to release locks before the
RPCService stops. Added a manager test to confirm del_host waits on the
manager's greenpool.

This modifies RPCService in two important ways:

1) The order of shutdown operations in RPCService.stop is changed to be
more correct. First, the server is stopped to prevent new requests from
arriving. Second, the manager is instructed to inform the cluster that
this conductor is shutting down. Finally, the conductor service stop()
method is called with graceful set to True to allow any tasks the
service currently has running to finish normally.

This is in contrast to the previous order of operations where the
service was told to immediately stop before stopping the server. This
could allow requests to arrive while the service has already stopped,
which is not ideal. Additionally, Service.stop was called in a way
which caused existing/running service tasks to immediately exit, which
could result in bad node or database state, necessitating manual
operator intervention.

2) The underlying Service object is told to shutdown gracefully, which
will allow tasks to complete before RPCService completely shuts down.

The NovaObjectSerializer is changed to serialize set iterables to
list instead of tuple. This was needed to ensure that every rpc
driver work in the same way. The normal rpc driver coverts tuples
to lists anyhow so this modification does not change the behavior
in production.
In the functional test environment the fake rpc driver does not
change anything on the message and it caused the filter scheduler
to receive a tuple in the filter_properties through rpc and
failed to append items to it.

This change is needed to use the functional test environment for
testing the filter scheduler.

scheduler_utils.setup_instance_group() can raise NoValidHost
exception and the conductor does not handle that properly which
causes the server to get stuck in a scheduling state instead of
going to ERROR.

The function is called several times in conductor/manager.py. This
patch moves the function calls in the try blocks already present.
It handles the missing Affinity filters as UnsupportedPolicyException,
which is a new exception type added here. This way the exception
raised by scheduler_utils.setup_instance_group() will cause the
VM to end up in ERROR state instead of NOSTATE, as it is expected.
Quota rollback is also handled properly, when it is needed.

Ironic's policy code was recently refactored.  As part of that work,
a new 'trusted_call' rule was added to policy.json that allows
granting/denying access to public APIs.  This is problematic, though,
as public access to public API routes now depends on specific rules
being configured in policy.json, and this creates an issue for upgrading.
Users who attempt to use new code with juno's policy.json and keystone
auth will find public API access is denied.

This reverts the API policy hook to always allow access to
public API endpoitns by default. Doing so allows policy.json
to be simplified considerably and keeps public endpoints
backward compatible with Juno's default policy.

This patch allows nova-compute to use QEMU iSCSI built-in
initiator for Cinder iSCSI volume drivers. It doesn't provide
iSCSI multipath capability, but host OS doesn't have to handle
iSCSI connection for volume because QEMU does it directly with
libiscsi.

To use this, you have to write a parameter at nova.conf:

  volume_drivers = iscsi=nova.virt.libvirt.volume.LibvirtNetVolumeDriver,iser=nova.virt.libvirt.volume.LibvirtISERVolumeDriver,...

or just

  volume_drivers = iscsi=nova.virt.libvirt.volume.LibvirtNetVolumeDriver

Note that qemu-system-x86 in Ubuntu has no iSCSI built-in
initiator support because libiscsi isn't in main repository
but universe. I've tested qemu-system-x86 built with libiscsi2
package of Debian on Ubuntu 14.04.

Currently the iSER driver is supported over TGT only,
and there are a couple of iSER classes that inherits
from iSCSI classes, but most of their functionality is
the same as the iSCSI classes. This code duplication caused
instability in the iSER driver code, when new features or
changes are added to the iSCSI driver flow.

Main changes:
  1. Added a new parameter to volume/driver.py in order to
     set the iSCSI protocol type to 'iscsi' or 'iser', with default
     to 'iscsi'.
  2. Configured TGT VOLUME_CONF and VOLUME_CONF_WITH_CHAP_AUTH
     with the new iSCSI protocol parameter.
  3. Added support for RDMA (using iSER) to cinder-rtstool.
  4. Set ""driver_volume_type"" to ""iscsi"" or ""iser"" value, according

  5. Added unit tests for the new iSER flow.
  6. Added deprecation alert to ISERTgtAdm.

The current Daemon class allows for spawning processes that are intended
to be daemonized. For example, the neutron-ns-metadata-proxy uses this
class to be able to be easily daemonized. The current implementation
requires that each such process inherit from the Daemon class (like the
metadata proxy does), but when trying to run valid Neutron processes
(like neutron-server or the l3 agent) in a daemonized mode, a new class
must be written for each such process. This patch creates a new
ProcessDaemon which allows for specifying an import patch and a function
to run (for example, 'neutron.server' and 'main' respectively) and runs
it in daemonized mode.

The reason why simply running '/usr/bin/neutron-server ... & disown'
won't work is that the '& disown' syntax is a specific bash syntax.
In short, using that will require running an interactive bash shell and
executing the program in that shell, which is far from optimal - so this
solution was chosen instead.

A new executable, neutron-daemon, is added. It accepts the following
options:
 - pid_file - path to save the PID of the daemonized process.
 - daemonize - True/False, indicating whether or not to daemonize.
 - name - an (hopefully) unique string for easier distinguishing between
          other daemons.
 - module - python path of the module to import after daemonization.
 - main_func - the function (located in the module) to run.
 - user - the user under which to run the process.
 - group - the group under which to run the process.

This is part of the integration tests effort:
 * [1/3] - Add ability to run daemonized Neutron processes
 - [2/3] - Add full-stack tests framework
 - [3/3] - Test that creating HA routers work

Add default connection_uri for libvirt for parallels
virt_type. Check for required libvirt version, it's going
to be 1.2.12, since libvirt driver is not completely
ready yet.

Also add a set of changes to generate proper domain XML
config for parallels virtual machines.

In method v3.servers.ServersController.update we check
that there is no 'host_id' property in requestbody.
But this case is checked by schema validation
('additionalProperties': False).
So we can remove this check.

Commit 488fcb4ad345bfb4fd614a140b317b606e008872 added a helper
for getting the AZ for a instance. This patch makes use of that
helper method.

This also removes the now unused get_availability_zone_by_host()
method from ec2utils and adds a reset_cache() call to the class
setup of CloudTestCase in test_cloud.py to reset the cache now
used between tests.
