Use consistent values for rabbit_host, rabbit_userid, and
rabbit_password across the guide. Previously there were a number of
variations, particularly of the host and password values.

In a subsequent patch I intend to cover off the fact that RabbitMQ
is installed/configured in at least two locations. I may depending
on feedback also end up adding an instruction to set the guest
user's password in which case a further update to rabbit_password
will be required.

I think just getting the initial values to base this work on consistent,
as I am proposing in this patch, is a good start.

Where programlisting elements that were touched use ""bash"" as the
language I have also flipped them to ""ini"".

Policy file contained malformed content so the policy
engine failed to parse it. That was the reason of rejecting
all requests, if authentication was enabled.

This patch also updates policies to get rid of unused policies
and use GenericCheck to check for admin API.

After changes mentioned above some unused code appeared in
ironic.common.policy and so it was cleaned up.

A typo made early in the object prototyping process has meant that
all objects thus far have been exposing a version of '1.0' because
the base object has been using an attribute of 'version'. The
object implementations have been exposing a 'VERSION' attribute

Fixes bug 1234826

This fix adds a ""nexus_l3_enable"" configuration boolean for the
Cisco Nexus plugin. When this config boolean is set to False (default),
then the Nexus switches are only used for L2 switching/segmentation, and
layer 3 functionality is deferred to the OVS subplugin / network
control node. If this config boolean is set to True, layer 3
functionality, e.g. switch virtual interfaces, are supported on
the Nexus switches. (Note that layer 3 functionality is not supported
on all versions/models Nexus switches.)

Some other things addressed with this fix:
- The l3_port_check keyword argument which is optionally passed to the
  Cisco plugin's delete_port method was not being forwarded on to the
  OVS (sub) plugin. This keyword argument needs to be forwarded to OVS
  e.g. when the delete_port is being done in the context of a
  router interface delete (whereby l3_port_check==False).
- UT test cases are added for new ""nexus_l3_enable"" config, which
  exercise router interface add/delete.
- The Cisco test_network_plugin.py module is refactored/reorganized
  in order to cleanly add a new router interface test class.
- The test_model_update_port_rollback test case was yielding a false
  positive result (device_owner was not being passed to self.port).

boto 2.13 has some interface changes with the get_http_connection
call which adds port as a non optional parameter *in the middle of*
existing non optional parameters. It's a special kind of incompatible
change.

We are already special casing around boto in the unit tests, lets
just do more of that if we are running on a newer version.

becomes a problem when a network reset is called for instances

Flavors list with marker is supposed to use flavorid as the marker since this is
the only id attribute the users can see, but it was using id (the confusion was
probably caused by the fact that flavorid attribute shows up to the user as id).

The change on db unit test shows makes the bug evident, and justify the changes
on the filter_by criteria.

The vmware driver is calling vmops.get_info for both the get_info and
get_diagnostics APIs which is wrong since they should be returning
different information.  Given the hypervisor support matrix doesn't list
the vmware driver as supporting the nova diagnostics API, it seems this
was just an oversight.

This patch changes the driver code to call the vmops.get_diagnostics
method which raises NotImplementedError.  It also fixes the tests to
actually ensure covers get_diagnostics for both the ESX driver and the
VC driver.

Cinder generally does not allow upload-to-image operation on a volume
that is 'in-use'. This can however be over-ridden using the '--force True'
flag. The VMware driver cannot support upload-to-image when the volume is
in-use. This is a restriction for the VMware driver alone. When the user forces
an upload on a volume that is 'in-use' the Cinder api layer sets the volume
status to 'uploading' and calls into the driver code to upload. In this
scenario the VMware driver needs to fail the operation.

The current driver code here does this check wrongly by looking for volume
status of 'in-use'. Fixing this check to identify an in-use volume correctly.

The intersphinx extensions let one reserve a link namespace and map it
to a remote URL, for example to refer to the Python documentation. A
drawback is that, from time to time, Sphinx will attempt to download an
object inventory from the remote, that is not convenient when running
sphinx in offline mode such as in a plane.

I am assuming most projects will not link to upstream Python
documentation and hence it is safe to remove the intersphinx extension.
The lines are left commented to let one easily reenable the feature
whenever they have a use case of it.

Previously when an admin created a combination alarm on
behalf of an non-admin identity, this had the effect of leaking
visibility onto alarms that would not normally
be visible to the non-admin tenant.

Now we validate all alarm ids with the project ID of the non-admin
identity that will ultimately own the alarm instead of the project ID
of the API caller.

Fixes bug 1237567

Previously when an admin created a threshold-oriented alarm on
behalf of an non-admin identity, this had the effect of leaking
visibility onto statistics for resources that would not normally
be visible to the non-admin tenant.

Now we ensure that an additional implicit threshold rule query
constraint is added on the project ID of the non-admin indentity
that will ultimately own the alarm.

This is acheived by splitting the query validation from the
construction of the kwargs from the query. The addition of the
implicit query constraint to the threshold rule can then be
delayed to a later point in the dispatch path where the full
context of the alarm is known (so that we can check for the case
where the alarm is created by an admin on behalf of another tenant).

VPNaaS and ML2 plugin won't work, because ML2 plugin

In this commit, we modify ipsec driver to use L3 plugin.
This is also backward compatible change, because if L2 plugin

When a subnet is deleted, certain ports referencing it are
auto-deleted. The implementation of NeutronDBPluginV2.delete_subnet()
does this at the DB level, so ML2's mechanism drivers were not being
called.

Ml2Plugin.delete_subnet() is changed to not use the base class's
method, and to auto-delete ports by calling its own delete_port()
method outside of the transaction. A loop avoids race conditions with
ports being asynchronously added to the subnet.

The logic in Ml2Plugin.delete_network() is also fixed to properly
handle auto-deleting ports and subnets, and debug logging is added to
the various delete methods.

The default base_url is now derived from the location
of the environment file, so now resource registry paths
can be relative instead of absolute URLs.

This change also includes the following:
* more complete test coverage
* refactor of _process_environment_and_files and
  _get_file_contents to make test coverage easier
* use the full URL instead of just the file name in the
  'files' field to avoid key clashes
* make _get_file_contents less specific to the resource registry
  so it can be used for other inclusion tasks
* stop calling _get_file_contents recursively so that deep URLs
  do not get loaded, instead call _get_file_contents on
  resource_registry and resource_registry.resources.*

For certain categories of use-case, the way we handle object checksums
does not suffice to prove data integrity of the objects. Since we cache
the checksums in the object's metadata, the data can be silently
corrupted when the end-user tries to validate it. This silent corruption
can be ameliorated if we allow the end-user to explicitly request that
the response recalculate the hash, and we can prove we're not cheating
if we allow them to specify a nonce that we prepend to the hash
calculation.

This commit adds two optional headers to the object server's get or
head requests:

    X-Recalculate-Etag: When set, causes the object-server to
                        recalculate the ETAg before returning it to the
                        end user.
    X-Etag-Nonce: A string which is prepended to the etag recalculation.
                  When set, it implicitly acts as though
                  X-Recalculate-Etag is also set. This header has a
                  MAXIMUM length of 128 bytes. Setting this header to
                  longer than 128 Bytes raises an HTTPPreconditionFailed
                  exception.

This patch makes libvirt raise an error if a live migration was
requested without shared storage for a volume-backed instance, if that
instance has any local disks.

The reason is that without shared storage, local disks will be
re-created on the destination node which can result in loss of data.

Live-migrating a volume-backed vm (i.e. booted from volume)
is currently broken.

This patch fixes the case where a volume-backed vm is to be
live-migrated without shared storage on compute nodes or
ephemeral volumes attached to the instance. Specifically, it
stops create_images_and_backing() from blowing up when no disk
info is supplied.

Previously when an admin created a combination alarm on
behalf of an non-admin identity, this had the effect of leaking
visibility onto alarms that would not normally
be visible to the non-admin tenant.

Now we validate all alarm ids with the project ID of the non-admin
identity that will ultimately own the alarm instead of the project ID
of the API caller.

Garbutt,johngarbutt,0,"xeanpi: pass network_info to generate_configdrive

Currently network_info is being fetched when generating config drive.
This change ensures the network_info that is already available is
re-used when generating the config_drive.

In addition, it is more consistent to use the network_info that is
passed into this function, rather than potentially lazy loading the
whole info_cache of the instance from the DB, which may not yet be
populated when we are generating the metadata for ConfigDrive anyway.

The hostname is removed from the metadata on Xen to address an
issue where windows instances get renamed on reboot.  This
becomes a problem when a network reset is called for instances
using the agent communication mechanism.  In that case the
agent will incorrectly rename the host.  Thus the
hostname needs to be set prior and cleared after a network reset.

The setting of the metadata params also need to be atomic so
locking was added that matches to the locking provided by
other data (network metadata).

A common pattern for templates is to define parameters
for passwords and specify the password on stack create.
For complex templates this can impact template maintainability
and makes stack creation more complicated.

In addition, a password parameter leaves the temptation of
using the same password (or worse, the parameter default) on
each stack launch which raises the security risk.

This resource allows secrets to be generated in the template and
propagated to compute resources as needed. Often the user will
never want to see the generated string, but if they do they
can put it in a stack output.

This resource has been requested by the tripleo project
who run trunk heat, so it will be of immediate benefit to them.

Live-migrating a volume-backed vm (i.e. booted from volume)
is currently broken.

This patch fixes the case where a volume-backed vm is to be
live-migrated without shared storage on compute nodes or
ephemeral volumes attached to the instance. Specifically, it
stops create_images_and_backing() from blowing up when no disk
info is supplied.

The keystone v3 client doesn't include the 'ec2' manager, even
though the EC2 API is included in the default pipeline.

This commit creates the ec2 manager manually if it's missing
(and necessary). It uses the same call that the client itself
should have used.

This patch makes libvirt raise an error if a live migration was
requested without shared storage for a volume-backed instance, if that
instance has any local disks.

The reason is that without shared storage, local disks will be
re-created on the destination node which can result in loss of data.

This addresses a minor (albeit important) logic error in the migration script
for https://review.openstack.org/#/c/46379/ - that script currently deletes
compute node stats for active compute nodes.  This patch reverses that logic
so it deletes the correct set of compute node stats.

Also included is a migration test case to demonstrate the behavior.

The logic to inspect a disk to determine if an image is PV or HVM has
been removed. This change follows on from that simplification.

As before, if I user wants to use PV mode, or HVM mode, then can set
vm_mode=xen or vm_mode=hvm, respectively. This will override any other
way of selecting the mode.

For consistency, we now check the os_type to be either windows or linux,
which, without vm_mode, chooses HVM or XEN mode respectively.

For backwards compatibility, all VHD and DISK type images default to
vm_mode=xen.

In all other cases, we default to HVM, as this is the safest option
that works with most images.

run_tests.sh -N -p

It will call the flake8 installed on your host to detect PEP8, and
the flake8 plugin ""OpenStack hacking"" may not installed on your
host, so this command may not detect the OpenStack Style Commandment
supplied by hacking(e.g H202).

run_tests.sh -p
it will call the flake8 from virtual env, flake8 plugin ""OpenStack
hacking"" installed in virtual env will be triggered.

The result from ""run_tests.sh -p"" should be trusted, and jenkins uses
virtual env to run flake8 too.

When ""-N"" is enabled, check whether hacking can be imported, if not,
emit warning to stderr to remind user.

$ ./run_tests.sh -p -N

This patch makes it possible to use the following snippet:

  ""VpcIp"": {
    ""Type"": ""AWS::EC2::EIP"",
    ""Properties"": {
      ""Domain"":""vpc""
    }

Previously the Heat service would fail the stack creation because it was
looking for the Neutron router created by means of AWS::EC2::VPC
resource.

When a subnet is deleted, certain ports referencing it are
auto-deleted. The implementation of NeutronDBPluginV2.delete_subnet()
does this at the DB level, so ML2's mechanism drivers were not being
called.

Ml2Plugin.delete_subnet() is changed to not use the base class's
method, and to auto-delete ports by calling its own delete_port()
method outside of the transaction. A loop avoids race conditions with
ports being asynchronously added to the subnet.

The logic in Ml2Plugin.delete_network() is also fixed to properly
handle auto-deleting ports and subnets, and debug logging is added to
the various delete methods.

Fixes bug 1237567

Previously when an admin created a threshold-oriented alarm on
behalf of an non-admin identity, this had the effect of leaking
visibility onto statistics for resources that would not normally
be visible to the non-admin tenant.

Now we ensure that an additional implicit threshold rule query
constraint is added on the project ID of the non-admin indentity
that will ultimately own the alarm.

This is acheived by splitting the query validation from the
construction of the kwargs from the query. The addition of the
implicit query constraint to the threshold rule can then be
delayed to a later point in the dispatch path where the full
context of the alarm is known (so that we can check for the case
where the alarm is created by an admin on behalf of another tenant).

While we don't need this for VM's, it's needed for real hardware
where we cannot predict the network configuration of the machines
unless we want statically configured network rules in the images
or crufty manual configuration.

This is compatible with file injection - it just tries to ensure
all undefined interfaces have a configuration stanza.

We don't have an implementation yet for RPM based machines, but
they have a workaround via their netboot configuration so at
least for machines with an eth0 will be no worse off with this
enabled - and disabling file injection is a key step for scalability.

This addresses a minor (albeit important) logic error in the migration script
for https://review.openstack.org/#/c/46379/ - that script currently deletes
compute node stats for active compute nodes.  This patch reverses that logic
so it deletes the correct set of compute node stats.

Also included is a migration test case to demonstrate the behavior.

This patch makes use of the boot_index information of block devices to
allow libvirt to boot from devices other than disks, and have more than
one boot device.

It does so by calculating the boot devices based on block devices type
and boot index, and then assigning the correct list to the GuestConfig's
os_boot_dev (that was made into a list in
I38abe9edaa8f93469d58ad81a466f68c2c0d24d6).
