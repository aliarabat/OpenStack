Ironic fails when deploying nodes using the direct deploy interface or
the iPXE boot interface when using the Ubuntu container images.

This happens because the www-data user running apache cannot read the
image files created by the ironic user.

This change fixes the issue by adding the www-data user to the ironic
group in the ironic-pxe image.

Previously, version-check.py would keep adding stable- to the tag each
time it is run. This was caused by the regex greedily matching stable-
as part of the project name rather than the tag.

This change fixes the issue by updating the regex.

[Spectrum Virtualize family] During creation of GMCV type volume
there are multiple lsvdisk calls made for checking the existence
of source change volume, aux volume and change aux volume.
Along with these calls there is a lssystem call which can be
optimized.

This patch optimizes these lsvdisk and lssystem calls which in
turn reduces the computational time for creating GMCV volumes.

Previously the owner field was not set by module
`cloud.openstack.image`, although it is specified as a module parameter.
The usual approach in `ansible-collections-openstack` is to accept both
names and IDs when referencing openstack resources.
Therefore this commit follows the approach taken by
`python-openstackclient` in [1] and introduces a `project` and a
`project_domain` parameter to identify projects by name or ID and
assign the ID to the `owner` attribute of the image.
The `owner` parameter is left as an alias to `project` in the module.

Disk and container image builds tend to be fairly unreliable.
With 3 voting seed jobs all building images, this can introduce
instability into the CI jobs.

This change adds a non-voting kayobe-seed-images-centos8s job, which
does the following:

* Builds IPA images
* Builds an overcloud host image
* Builds a base container image

Similar Rocky and Ubuntu jobs are added to the experimental pipeline,
and may be run by commenting 'check experimental' in gerrit.

The existing kayobe-seed-* jobs no longer build images.

This reverts commit 840129097631611fe110bbe01b1707f9db000865.

We are reverting this because some users may want to use predictable
device names and may not even use Debian. However, after some
investigation we have found a couple of bugs in dhcp-all-interfaces on
Debuntu distros. The parent change corrects those bugs. Additionally new
Linux kernels emit ""move"" events to udev when interfaces are renamed to
their predictable name. Support this ""move"" in the dhcp-all-interfaces
udev rules. Making these changes appaers to produce functional images
for Debian users using predictable device names. If predictable device
names are not desired turning them off is straightforward and release
notes are updated to give users the info they need to do that outside of
this element.

Currently when dependent service is defined using the depends_on key,
tripleo-ansible adds 'Wants' so that the dependent service is also
started. However this attribute does not guarantee that the dependent
service is started BEFORE the target service is started.

Because current usage of depends_on expect the dependent service is
started before the target service, this change adds 'After' so that
the ordering is properly enforced.

A race condition exists where if the quota_usages
table is empty, multiple simultaneous volume create
operations may introduce duplicate rows with the same
resource (volume) and project_id.

This causes the quota code to generally not function
correctly.

The database should likely have a contraint to prevent
that from happening.  But, this fix will help mitigate
the problem and can be backported to earlier releases,
unlike a database schema change.  It also can be applied
to a deployment that already has a database in this invalid
state.

When quota reservation is done, lock on the project id
for that reservation.  This will introduce a performance
penalty for a single tenant performing many simultaneous
volume creates, but will prevent the quota system from
breaking due to this race condition.

removing required_defaults_RedHat.yml;
efi_distro seems to only get used for grub_config_path, and 'rhel'
is not the correct path on my UEFI rhel8 system. It's 'redhat', and
according to the only documentation [1] I found on a quick search,
it's probably been this since EL6. Which means we can use
'redhat' all over the board.

The unique values in efi_distro, grub_efi_binary and shim_efi_binary
correspond to ansible_facts['distribution'], which holds true for
centos and fedora aswell, so we can put all these in RedHat_family

removing required_defaults_CentOS.yml;
The common values from required_defaults_RedHat_family.yml should
suffice.

removing required_defaults_Fedora.yml;
Support for fedora has been deprecated [2], but since it's in the
os_family of redhat, we're only missing 'qemu-kvm' and
'policycoreutils-python-utils' from 'required_packages', so
deployment will probably still work.

Cinder backup per_user mode, provides auth_token for swift connection.
This token used by swift for keystonemiddleware authentication during
upload. Large size volume takes more time for backup than the token
expiration and hence backup fails. Instead of using auth_token,
use trusts (if auth_version is 3) which will allow to continue
the upload after token expiration since new token is provided before
the expiry of earlier token. Delete trusts during close connection
(by default it expires after 24 hours).

In the policy_enforcement module if policy.enforce() will raise
PolicyNotAuthorized exception, there is additional check if user is
trying to modify own or someone else resource. In case when user is not
allowed to show resource even, error 404 is raised to ""hide"" any
information about requested resource.
But that was also the case for POST (create resource) requests and 404
error when user is trying e.g. create network is confusing.
So this patch modifies that logic and in case of ""create_"" actions it
will return 403 if user was not authorized to do such operation.

Grafana requires the scrape interval to be set to be able to compute
$__rate_interval. The default is 15s which does not match the kolla
default of 60s. The symptom of not setting this is that you will see
""no data"" when zooming graphs that use rate queries. This occurs as the
interval will be set to a period shorter than the scrape interval.
The recommendation is that you use a common scrape interval for all
jobs. See:

Since we use usedevelop=True, as a result neutron
installation happens at 'develop-inst' phase and it installs
requirements from requirements.txt without considering
tox constraints, This can lead to issue where broken
requirements are installed in docs job and as a result
it will fail.

In order to get constraints be considered for this case, add
requirements.txt to deps for docs env.

Also squashed below commit:-

Docs build: Add NOTE to not remove requirements.txt

To avoid unintentionally remove requirements.txt
from deps list from docs env, add a NOTE.

```

tripleo-ci-centos-9-content-provider reuses the irrelevant files
from tripleo-ci-centos-8-standalone.

https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tripleo-ansible/+/839685/
is a unique change where only molecule files are modified. In gate
job, cs-9 content provider is getting skipped due to irrelevant
files. It leads to Zuul job freeze issue.

Removing molecule from there fixes the issue.

We have seen account stats become distorted: in worst case
an account with only one container drops to reporting zero
bytes and zero object count despite the container having
objects. And can remain stuck until another object is PUT
or DELETEd into the container.

In general the edgecase goes:
  1. a container PUT lands on a handoff at t1,
     so the handoff db has zero object count.
  2. subsequent PUTs land on primaries, say at t2
  3. primaries update account with valid obj count and bytes
  4. handoff update account with zero obj count and bytes
  5. no more objects are PUT so primaries make no more
     updates to account
  6. container replication leaves primary put timestamp
     unchanged because handoff put time is older than
     primary -> no primary updates to account

Then the account remains stuck with zero obj count and bytes
used until an object is put or deleted at which point a
primary will update the account stats.

To solve this problem this patch adds an additional check
to the container-updater. If the broker has no incoming-syncs
then don't update. Missing incoming syncs could mean 3 things:

  1. It could be a handoff database, a primary wont replicate
     with it.
     - If this is the case then it doesn't have a good view of
       the stats to update the account. So we don't want to
       report.
  2. Its a new db on a replica after a rebalance, in this
     case the other ""old"" replicas haven't yet talked with it so
     again it doesn't have a good enough view of the world... yet.
     But after 1 replication sync it's got a much better one.
  3. Its a brand new container, after the initial PUT but before
     the replicators have had a chance to run. In this case we
     loose nothing in waiting until one replica has replicated
     with the others.

To make things a little more complicated, in order to support single
replica container rings we need the ability to all containers to be
able to undate (single replica will have no incoming_syncs).
To solve this the container-updater now loads container ring
metadata (only) to grab the number of replicas. If it's only a single
replica ring then the old behaviour stands, that is any container will
update the account.

When the nova-compute service starts, by default it attempts to
startup instance configuration states for aspects such as networking.
This is fine in most cases, and makes a lot of sense if the
nova-compute service is just managing virtual machines on a hypervisor.

This is done, one instance at a time.

However, when the compute driver is ironic, the networking is managed
as part of the physical machine lifecycle potentially all the way into
committed switch configurations. As such, there is no need to attempt
to call ``plug_vifs`` on every single instance managed by the
nova-compute process which is backed by Ironic.

Additionally, using ironic tends to manage far more physical machines
per nova-compute service instance then when when operating co-installed
with a hypervisor. Often this means a cluster of a thousand machines,
with three controllers, will see thousands of un-needed API calls upon
service start, which elongates the entire process and negatively
impacts operations.

In essence, nova.virt.ironic's plug_vifs call now does nothing,
and merely issues a debug LOG entry when called.

The scafolding for the 'About the project' needed to be added

moved into it.

The tabs feature was added to Sphinx in order to provide a
reasonable display of the charm channel information.

inherent hazardous nature.

In multinode, the devstack plugin for networking-generic-switch can't
really work as intended. But, the authorized keys is copied on all
nodes, and zuul puts a consistent key in place, so it doesn't
really need to do what it is doing, but we need to use the stack
user's pre-existing keys to access the remote host.

This will allow Ironic's multinode grenade job to work without
errors about accessing the key file, which is a red herring for
when the connection fails.

Additionally, the underlying ngs code is suseptible to a race on
configuration loading as configuration is loaded separately.

We can't really force it to load the option. We also can't
explicitly add it, so the best thing to do is to wrap it and
rely upon a mock to facilitate the unit test.

When ovn/dns_servers consist of IPv6 dns nameservers,
it was getting added to IPv4 dhcp options also, and due to
this an invalid nameserver(last 4 octets of an IPv6 address)
is set in the instances.

This patch filters IPv4/IPv6 dns nameservers and set
dhcpv4/dhcpv6 options accordingly.

Also when dns_nameservers are not set for IPv6 subnets,
get those from ovn/dns_servers config or system nameservers
just like it's done with the IPv4 subnets. Updated
get_system_dns_resolvers to pick both IPv4/IPv6 valid
ips, this also requires bump of oslo.utils minimum version
to 4.8.0 to use strict option for IPv4[1].

Additionally fix some unit tests which were setting IPv4 dns
nameservers on the IPv6 subnets, this is not allowed with api.

Conflicts:
  lower-constraints.txt
  requirements.txt

[Stable Only] Since Neutron stable policy do not allow bumping
of minimum version of a requirement in stable releases, so doing
a partial backport by not backporting requirements.txt changes and
updated get_system_dns_resolvers to work with older version of
oslo.utils.

Glance quota system is currently based on static value in config file,
so commmon for all tenant and cannot be consulted or edited without a
configuration change. There was many attempt to enhance this quota
system with a DB-based quota mecanism like we can found in Nova or
Cinder, but it was finally never implemented.

The goal here is to rely on the Keystone unified limit system[1], in
order to store the quota for each tenant in Keystone. This way, only
the enforcing of the quota will be done Glance side, using the
oslo.limit[2] library.

When uploading a volume to glance as an image, the glance server don't
know the image size, so the backend storage server(such as ceph) need to
resize the image every time it received new chunk of data(by default
64K). So there will be huge times of resize operations that will
terribly impact the performance.

This spec aims to tell the image size to glance server at the initial
phase of uploading, so that glance backend such as ceph can allocate an
image with exact size, and don't need to resize the image again and
again.

to get the lbs accessible from the vms we need to

Bug rhbz#2043543.
If in future ovn automatically handles addition of
lbs to logical_switches if they exist on associated
logical_router, then we can remove this handling
from port-forwarding service plugin.

Also subscribed to router_interface's after create

There are cases on the detach process where an error is not considered a
failure, so the exception is ignored.

The problem is that we currently may not leave any trace in the logs
that an error actually happened.

This patch adds a simple warning log message to ensure that at least
there is some kind of notification about it.

We no longer need to do this.  If you run
""tox -e py38"", ""tox -e py39"", and ""tox -e py310"",
you will see:

See PEP-3147 for details on this.

This is different from the older behavior, which
would generate cinder/context.pyc and collide between
different versions of Python.  In the versions of
Python that we support, no such collisions happen.

prior, one of the goals for the openstack-helm project is to
retire any of the unused repositories under the openstack-helm

This change seeks to retire the openstack-helm-docs repo since
it hasn't been maintained and all the documentation lives within
the openstack-helm repo itself.

Importing pkg_resources has a side-effect of scanning the metadata of
all of the installed python modules to build an in-memory cache. That
cache isn't used anywhere in keystoneclient, and it can be expensive
to build.

The importlib.metadata module in the 3.8 standard library (and the
importlib_metadata library for earlier versions) provides the same
version lookup service using a more efficient scanning
implementation. Switching from pkg_resources to importlib.metadata
will help application startup time, which is especially important for
command line programs such as python-openstackclient.

As If9ab424cc7375a1f0d41b03f01c4a823216b3eb8 stated there is a way for
the pci_device table to become inconsistent. Parent PF can be in
'available' state while children VFs are still in 'unavailable' state.
In this situation the PF is schedulable but the PCI claim will fail to
when try to mark the dependent VFs unavailable.

This patch adds a test case that shows the error.

We saw in the field that the pci_devices table can end up in
inconsistent state after a compute node HW failure and re-deployment.
There could be dependent devices where the parent PF is in available
state while the children VFs are in unavailable state. (Before the HW
fault the PF was allocated hence the VFs was marked unavailable).

In this state this PF is still schedulable but during the
PCI claim the handling of dependent devices in the PCI tracker fill fail
with the error: ""Attempt to consume PCI device XXX from empty pool"".

The reason of the failure is that when the PF is claimed, all the
children VFs are marked unavailable. But if the VF is already
unavailable such step fails.

One way the deployer might try to recover from this state is to remove
the VFs from the hypervisor and restart the compute agent. The compute
startup already has a logic to delete PCI devices that are unused and
not reported by the hypervisor. However this logic only removed devices
in 'available' state and ignored devices in 'unavailable' state.

If a device is unused and the hypervisor is not reporting the device any
more then it is safe to delete that device from the PCI tracker. So this
patch extends the logic to allow deleting 'unavailable' devices. There
is a small window when dependent PCI device is in 'unclaimable' state.
From cleanup perspective this is an analogous state. So it is also
added to the cleanup logic.

When new default policy rules and scope enforcement are enabled, Neutron
needs to handle properly not only PolicyNotAuthorized exception from
oslo_policy module but also InvalidScope exception.
This patch adds handling of that exception to the neutron policy
modules.

In the check() method from the neutron.policy module we are calling
ENFORCER.enforce() method with do_raise=False which means that
PolicyNotAuthorized isn't rasised. Unfortunately it seems that there is
bug in oslo.policy module and InvalidScope is raised even with
do_raise=False.
For now, lets workaround it in Neutron by properly handling InvalidScope
exception in the check() method.
This workaround can be cleaned when bug [1] will be fixed in
oslo.policy.

While the focus of the routed provider networks documentation
is on the Neutron side of things, this document provides a useful
location to point at relevant Nova configuration.

This reference relates to the Nova scheduler and ensuring that
instance move operations don't result in instances being scheduled
to hosts which do not have access to the required network(s).

During the testing If9ab424cc7375a1f0d41b03f01c4a823216b3eb8 we noticed
that the unit test cases of PciTracker._set_hvdev are changing and
leaking global state leading to unstable tests.

To reproduce on master, duplicate the
test_set_hvdev_remove_tree_maintained_with_allocations test case and run
PciDevTrackerTestCase serially. The duplicated test case will fail with

  File ""/nova/nova/objects/pci_device.py"", line 238, in _from_db_object
  setattr(pci_device, key, db_dev[key])
  KeyError: 'id'

This is caused by the fact that the test data is defined on module
level, both _create_tracker and _set_hvdevs modifies the devices
passed to them, and some test mixes passing db dicts to _set_hvdevs
that expects pci dicts from the hypervisor.

This patch fixes multiple related issues:
* always deepcopy what _create_tracker takes as that list is later
  returned to the PciTracker via a mock and the tracker might modify
  what it got

* ensure that _create_tracker takes db dicts (with id field) while
  _set_hvdevs takes pci dicts in the hypervisor format (without id
  field)

* always deepcopy what is passed to _set_hvdevs as the PciTracker modify
  what it gets.

* normalize when the deepcopy happens to give a safe patter for future
  test cases

The vmwareapi driver uses Managed-Object references throughout the code
with the assumption that they are stable. It is however a database id,
which may change during the runtime of the compute node. e.g. If an
instance is unregistered and re-registerd in the vcenter, the moref will
change. By wrapping a moref in a proxy object, with an additional method
to resolve the openstack object to a moref, we can hide those changes
from a caller.

MoRef implementation with closure - should ease the transition to stable
mo-refs One simply has to pass the search function as a closure to the
MoRef instance, and the very same method will be called when an
exception is raised for the stored reference.

Stable Volume refs - The connection_info['data'] contains the
managed-object reference (moref) as well as the uuid of the volume.
When the moref become invalid for some reason, we can recover it by
searching for the volume-uuid as the `config.instanceUuid` attribute
of the shadow-vm.

Stable VM Ref - By encapsulating all the parameters for searching for
the vm-ref again, we can move the retry logic to the session object,
where we can try to recover the vm-ref should it result in a
ManagedObjectNotFound exception.

Use refs as index for fakedb -  It was previously using the object-id
to lookup an object, meaning that you couldn't pass a newly created
Managed-object-reference like you could over the vmware-api. Now the
lookup happens over the ref-id string, and in turn some functions
were refactored to take that into account.

- there is a transaction and this transaction is active
- there is no transaction [2], the class ``_orm.Session`` will

With this change, firewall rule for ssl endpoints are removed from base
firewall rules because these ports are used by haproxy and not used by
api services.

Also, the adhoc implementation to run firewall configurations first is

When ovn/dns_servers consist of IPv6 dns nameservers,
it was getting added to IPv4 dhcp options also, and due to
this an invalid nameserver(last 4 octets of an IPv6 address)
is set in the instances.

This patch filters IPv4/IPv6 dns nameservers and set
dhcpv4/dhcpv6 options accordingly.

Also when dns_nameservers are not set for IPv6 subnets,
get those from ovn/dns_servers config or system nameservers
just like it's done with the IPv4 subnets. Updated
get_system_dns_resolvers to pick both IPv4/IPv6 valid
ips, this also requires bump of oslo.utils minimum version
to 4.8.0 to use strict option for IPv4[1].

Additionally fix some unit tests which were setting IPv4 dns
nameservers on the IPv6 subnets, this is not allowed with api.

In multinode, the devstack plugin for networking-generic-switch can't
really work as intended. But, the authorized keys is copied on all
nodes, and zuul puts a consistent key in place, so it doesn't
really need to do what it is doing, but we need to use the stack
user's pre-existing keys to access the remote host.

This will allow Ironic's multinode grenade job to work without
errors about accessing the key file, which is a red herring for
when the connection fails.

Additionally, the underlying ngs code is suseptible to a race on
configuration loading as configuration is loaded separately.

We can't really force it to load the option. We also can't
explicitly add it, so the best thing to do is to wrap it and
rely upon a mock to facilitate the unit test.

Previously, the libvirt driver's live migration rollback code would
unconditionally refer to migrate_data.vifs. This field would only be
set if the Neutron multiple port bindings extension was in use. When
it is not in use, the reference would fail with a NotImplementedError.
This patch wraps the migrate_data.vifs reference in a conditional that
checks if the vifs field is actually set. This is the only way to do
it, as in the libvirt driver we do not have access to the network
API's has_port_binding_extension() helper.

Remote-managed port support relies on placing additional data into
the ""binding:profile"" attribute of a port: a mac address of a PF
associated with a VF and the VF number. This data is currently
retrieved via sysfs at the time when it needs to be placed into
binding:profile initially or when it needs to be updated during
migration processes.

To avoid having extra sysfs dependencies in the manager and neutron
modules, those attributes are now stored in the extra-info of a given
VF's PciDevice and persisted in the DB.

The PF mac is stored for each VF since PFs are not guaranteed to be
present in the whitelist and so may not be present in the database in
the first place. A by-product of that is that it is easier to access
this data by just looking at a given VF's extra-info dict.

This change adds no_log to the parameter.

If any nova compute service fails to register itself, Kolla Ansible will
fail the host that queries the Nova API. This is the first compute host
in the inventory, and fails in the task:

    Waiting for nova-compute services to register themselves

Other hosts continue, often leading to further errors later on. Clearly
this is not idea.

This change modifies the behaviour to query the compute service list
until all expected hosts are present, but does not fail the querying
host if they are not. A new task is added that executes for all hosts,
and fails only those hosts that have not registered successfully.

Alternatively, to fail all hosts in a cell when any compute service
fails to register, set nova_compute_registration_fatal to true.

Kayobe has fairly coarse-grained default groups - controller, compute,
etc, which work well in the majority of cases. Kolla Ansible allows much
more fine-grained placement on a per-service basis, e.g.
ironic-conductor. If the operator has taken advantage of this
fine-grained placement, then it is possible that some of the assumptions
in Kayobe may be incorrect. This is one downside of the split between
Kayobe and Kolla Ansible.

For example, Ironic conductor services may have been moved to a subset
of the top level 'controllers' group. In this case, we would not want
the Ironic networks to be mapped to all hosts in the controllers group -
only those running Ironic conductor services. The same argument can be
made if the loadbalancer services (HAProxy & keepalived) or Neutron
dataplane services (e.g. L3 & DHCP agents) have been separated from the
top level 'network' group.

This change abstracts the placement of Ironic conductor Ironic
inspector, loadbalancer and network services into separate variables,
rather than referencing the top level 'controllers' and 'network' groups
directly. These variables may be updated by the operator to match the
service placement.

When tox 'docs' target is called, first it installs the dependencies
(listed in 'deps') in 'installdeps' phase, then it installs nova (with
its requirements) in 'develop-inst' phase. In the latter case 'deps' is
not used so that the constraints defined in 'deps' are not used.
This could lead to failures on stable branches when new packages are
released that break the build. To avoid this, the simplest solution is
to pre-install requirements, i.e. add requirements.txt to 'docs' tox
target.

NOTE(elod.illes): conflict is due to branch specific upper constraints

openstack%2Fnova~master~I63208c7bd5f9f4c3d5e4a40bd0f6253d0f042a37,openstack/nova,master,sqlalchemy-20,I63208c7bd5f9f4c3d5e4a40bd0f6253d0f042a37,db: Resolve additional SAWarning warnings,MERGED,2022-04-08 15:54:51.000000000,2022-04-29 05:27:18.000000000,2022-04-29 05:25:46.000000000,25,10,5,837162,8142b9dc47b7096ab9d8180f0b5b1e52d513e2dc,28,4,1,3,15334,Stephen Finucane,sfinucan,"db: Resolve additional SAWarning warnings

Resolving the following SAWarning warnings:

  Coercing Subquery object into a select() for use in IN(); please pass
  a select() construct explicitly

  SELECT statement has a cartesian product between FROM element(s)
  ""foo"" and FROM element ""bar"". Apply join condition(s) between each
  element to resolve.

While the first of these was a trivial fix, the second one is a little
more involved. It was caused by attempting to build a query across
tables that had no relationship as part of our archive logic. For
example, consider the following queries, generated early in
'_get_fk_stmts':

  SELECT instances.uuid
  FROM instances, security_group_instance_association
  WHERE security_group_instance_association.instance_uuid = instances.uuid
    AND instances.id IN (__[POSTCOMPILE_id_1])

  SELECT security_groups.id
  FROM security_groups, security_group_instance_association, instances
  WHERE security_group_instance_association.security_group_id = security_groups.id
    AND instances.id IN (__[POSTCOMPILE_id_1])

While the first of these is fine, the second is clearly wrong: why are
we filtering on a field that is of no relevance to our join? These were
generated because we were attempting to archive one or more instances
(in this case, the instance with id=1) and needed to find related tables
to archive at the same time. A related table is any table that
references our ""source"" table - 'instances' here - by way of a foreign
key. For each of *these* tables, we then lookup each foreign key and
join back to the source table, filtering by matching entries in the
source table. The issue here is that we're looking up every foreign key.
What we actually want to do is lookup only the foreign keys that point
back to our source table. This flaw is why we were generating the second
SELECT above: the 'security_group_instance_association' has two foreign
keys, one pointing to our 'instances' table but also another pointing to
the 'security_groups' table. We want the first but not the second.

Resolve this by checking if the table that each foreign key points to is
actually the source table and simply skip if not. With this issue
resolved, we can enable errors on SAWarning warnings in general without
any filters.

This is very rough, but done enough that it actually seems to work!
The builder and ringdata objects could be unified better. For example
one side had part_power with a part_shift property, the other a
part_shift with a part_power property. Some of the naming of things
aren't the same.

One annoyance is the dispersion graph because it uses tuples as keys
can't be json-ified. So will need to find a different way to serialize
that... please don't let it be pickle :P

This is still a WIP. Hacked enough to to make it work. But surprisingly
seems to work. I can add devs, rebalance, run dispersion report etc.
A ringdata load gives us just a rings POV. Builder load grabs everything and
returns it as a builder dict. So it has everything it needs.
These 2 load methods could probably be merged better seeing as they
basically do the same thing.

This is terrible hack but it seems that there is no other way to
fix/workaround the race which may happen during live-migration between:
- port update event comming from the OVN db (port DOWN on the src node),
- API call from nova-compute to activate port binding on the destination
node.

If those 2 events will be executed in specific order by different
workers it may happen that port binding activation will not update
""requested_chassis"" of the port in OVN northd due to revision mismatch
(ovn_revision and neutron_revision will be already bumped by the worker
which processes ""port update"" OVN event).
If ""requested_chassis"" will not be updated, OVN will not claim port on
the dest node thus connectivity to the vm will be broken.

To workaround that issue, port_update_postcommit method from the OVN
mechanism driver will catch RevisionMismatch exception raised by the
ovn_client and in case that this was port_update after live_migration,
will get port data from neutron db and try to update port in the OVN
northd once again.

Since nodepool just keeps trying to talk to the cloud and start an

 https://meetings.opendev.org/irclogs/%23opendev/%23opendev.2022-01-26.log.html#t2022-01-26T17:06:12

Traditionally we've co-gated these projects as nodepool has had a very
close relationship with shade and now openstacksdk.  For now nodepool
is just testing against released openstacksdk; but the dependent
change reverts this and thus should exibit this issue.

The v2 worker was not waiting for a resource to be set to PENDING_UPDATE
before updating it effectively. In some circumstances (loaded
server/slow DB for instance), the resources may have been updated with
old data from the DB, resulting in a no-op update.

This wait for a PENDING_UPDATE state exists in amphorav1 but it was not
moved to v2 when we switched the logic from the DB-based objects to
dict-based objects.

The final generated sphinx syntax is[1] where [--exclude-deprecated]

Below commit changed the integrated-gate-compute job template
behaviour for stable branches. This template is used for master
as well as the stable branches also and we should not change
stable branches gate while adding the new jobs. centos-8-stream
job is meant to be run from stable/wallaby to stable/yoga and
from zed cycle onwards centos-9-stream should run,

- https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tempest/+/839274/1/zuul.d/integrated-gate.yaml#369
