In case router is deleted during l3 agent resync,

PEP 333 (WSGI) says: ""If the iterable returned by the application has
a close() method, the server or gateway must call that method upon
completion of the current request[.]""

There's a bunch of places where we weren't doing that; some of them
matter more than others. Calling .close() can prevent a connection
leak in some cases. In others, it just provides a certain pedantic
smugness. Either way, we should do what WSGI requires.

Noteworthy goofs include:

  * If a client is downloading a large object and disconnects halfway
    through, a proxy -> obj connection may be leaked. In this case,
    the WSGI iterable is a SegmentedIterable, which lacked a close()
    method. Thus, when the WSGI server noticed the client disconnect,
    it had no way of telling the SegmentedIterable about it, and so
    the underlying iterable for the segment's data didn't get
    closed.

    Here, it seems likely (though unproven) that the object server
    would time out and kill the connection, or that a
    ChunkWriteTimeout would fire down in the proxy server, so the
    leaked connection would eventually go away. However, a flurry of
    client disconnects could leave a big pile of useless connections.

  * If a conditional request receives a 304 or 412, the underlying
    app_iter is not closed. This mostly affects conditional requests
    for large objects.

The leaked connections were noticed by this patch's co-author, who
made the changes to SegmentedIterable. Those changes helped, but did
not completely fix, the issue. The rest of the patch is an attempt to
plug the rest of the holes.

This commit is a preparation step for enabling pluggable ipam.
Some actions in create_port and save_subnet are specific for
non pluggable ipam implementation.

- create_port
Moved allocation ips for port and storing results into separate method
_allocate_ips_for_port_and_store.
Moved to ipam_non_pluggable_backend, since pluggable implementation will
be different due to rollback on failure logic included.

- save_subnet
Moved saving allocation pools into new method _save_allocation_pools.
Moved to ipam_non_pluggable_backend, since pluggable ipam implementation
does not need to save IPAvailabilityRange (availability ranges are
maintained by ipam driver for pluggable case)

Previously we sent the ssync backend frag index based on the node
index.  We need to be more specific for ssync to handle both sync
and revert cases so now we send the frag index based on the job
contents (as determined by the ec recon)) and the node index
as a new header based on, well, the node index.

The rcvr can now validate the incoming pair to reject (400) when
a primary node is being asked to accept fragments that don't
belong to it.  Additionally, by having the frag index the
rcvr can reject (409) an attempt to accept a fragment when its
a handoff and already has one that needs to be reverted.

a variable number of messages to send and batches them so that they can be read

as we pass them to the send_messages function.  If the input data is not a list

This introduces lot more strain on the plugin to

it manages, and if condition satisfies, the agent will

Based on the parent patch, right now the Floatingip
agent gateway ports will only be deleted when the
external gateway port associated with the router is
deleted.

The Floatingip agent gateway port will not be deleted
for every association and disassociation.

The Floatingip agent gateway port was created on all
nodes as a substitute for the gateway port. So it makes
sense to delete those ports only when the gateway port
is deleted.

The agent should be able to delete the floatingip agent
gateway port on a given external network when it is not
required.

This would substantially reduce the burden on the server
to validate, read and delete from the DB.

Move the angular app module from the framework to
openstack_dashboard at the top level as ""horizon.app"".

This edit also removes the old hzUtils.log function: it
exists in the framework, but is configured in the application,
thus causing dependency issues. It is only used in one place
(hz.tables.js), and for debugging. I contend that if debugging
is needed then $log can be asked for as needed.

The hzConfig.debug flag was only used by that one function,
so it is also removed in this edit.

unnecessary access to the db.

This patch will delete the FIP agent gateway port when

This patch will allow the agent to notify the
plugin to delete the Floatingip agent gateway
port if it is not required anymore.

At present the plugin tries to delete the Floatingip
agent gateway port when floatingip disassociates,
floatingip deletes or when a port using the Floatingip
is deleted.

This introduces more complexity as well as tries to
query the db frequently.

Having the SDK configure the root logger is problematic as it
not only enables logging in the SDK but it also enables
logging in the users app and logging in other libs unrelated
to the SDK as an unintented side-effect. We should only log
for the openstack module.

We also want to be more selective about what stream to log
to so we provide the option to log to stdout or stderr.

The plan is to move the regexes to devstack-gate but to test them we

Implementation of a command line wrapped build on top of mapping engine.
Its main goal is checking effects of input parsed by RuleProcessor with
set of provided mapping rules. User must provide two files: a) rules
file with proper JSON with mapping rules (identical to those uploaded to
the server) b) a file with key-value set of environ-like parameters.

Basic usage:

$ keystone-manage mapping_engine --help
$ keystone-manage mapping_engine --rules <path> --input <path>

Upon successful execution program outputs to the stdout a JSON structure
with effective objects like user, group_ids and user_names.

hacking and the cluster of tools it brings in are updated by projects
in a lazy fashion. As such, tracking the things that hacking specifies
inside global-requirements doesn't make sense: we can't compile them
into the upper-constraints file, since repositories do not upgrade
their codebases in lockstep. We already have a special case where
hacking is passed through as-is without checking its presence in
global-requirements.txt, so this is a very simple change.

fields may be missing and some are named differently.

We add the method update_from_virt_driver() to the ComputeNode

change the format or semantics of the object, so this change does
not bump the ComputeNode object version number.

This method will be used in a subsequent patch that replace the
compute_node dict in the resource tracker with a ComputeNode
object.

This change adds a number of new tasks that are dependent on the value
of the Keystone token provider (keystone_token_provider) user variable.

If the keystone_token_provider user_variable is set to
keystone.token.providers.fernet.Provider then the playbooks will
appropriately create the fernet keys and distribute them to the rest of
the keystone containers.

This also implements key rotation for generated fernet keys similar to
how the os_nova roles implement key rotation.

Finally, we also need to build cryptography from master for now.
Currently, 0.8.x and 0.9.x use versions of cffi<1.0 which causes a bug
when used with mod_wsgi and Apache. This is fixed in cryptography master
and will be released in 1.0.

This change makes it possible for OSAD to instruct yaprt to NEVER
do anything with tempest and the requirements that are being
brought with the requirements that can cause issues with un-versioned
requirements. This flag simply instructs yaprt to index the repo
as a item in the report but in this case absolutely no requirements
will be indexed or built for tempest.

This was done because tempest does not version anything and its
forward movement makes it impossible to maintain a consistent stack
and for our purposes, we install tempest in a venv using an isolated
install so none of these tempest requirements are necessary for us
to have to deal with.

os-tenant-networks API is called by normal user. So the create action
should be allowed to create new network which belong to the requester.

This patch passes the project_id down to the nova manager, then make
it create a new network belong to the requester.

The db call network_create_safe is still admin required. That will be
fixed by db permission cleanup patch later.

This patch introduces galera_wsrep_provider_options as a list of
options instead of only catering for changing the gcache.size
option. This allows the deployer to change any number of the
wsrep_provider_options available.

Note: The variable galera_gcache_size is respected in this patch
but if galera_wsrep_provider_options is customised by a deployer
then the custom list must include reference to galera_gcache_size
for it to be respected.

When the template file for a template/facade/provider resource is
not found in the new files list when doing a stack update, Heat
silently falls back to using the existing template (i.e. so no
change will be made).
The cause is that the update code shares the same code path for
obtaining the template as the init code. The init code needs to
have a fallback, so that loading the (parent) stack never fails,
however in the update case it is undesirable.

for adding user IDs for access to a given secret or container. This
blueprint proposes allowing group IDs to be added to ACLs to
accommodate users within specified groups access to
secrets/containers as well. Adding group support to ACLs would support
LDAP group based access to secrets/containers.

This blueprint depends on the approval of a Keystone blueprint:

After the introduction of unit tests for the _neutron_exceptions

    AttributeError: <class 'shade.OpenStackCloud'> does not have the

This error is due to the wrong location of test__neutron_excetpions

 the  _neutron_exception context, just using the existing code.

ML2 delete_port operation currently involves locking ports

cases when several ports are deleted concurrently.
That may happen due to specifics of Galera working in active-active

a change with other members of the cluster.

Checking if use_linked_clone is None doesn't make any sense because this
is boolean config property which is either True or False (default is
True). If the user hasn't specified a boolean value, the configuration
framework will raise ConfigFileValueError, so there is no need to make
this check in Nova.

The template provision a Mesos cluster with Marathon and Docker.
It is assumed that users provide a Ubuntu base image with Mesos
pre-installed (how to build such image will be documented in another
patch). A provisioned Mesos cluster consists of two types of nodes:
master and slave.

A master node will have the following processes running:
* Zookeeper: A distributed configuration and service discovery service.
* Mesos-master: A process for orchestrating the running of tasks on slaves.
* Marathon: A cluster-wide init and control system for services.

A slave node will have the following processes running:
* Docker: The container engine.
* Mesos-slave: A process for running tasks.

The following features are NOT yet supported:
* Docker storage support.
* Docker network (Flannel or Neutron support).
* Multiple Mesos master nodes.
* Additional Mesos frameworks (i.e. Chronos, Aurora, etc.).
Some of them will be addressed in later patches. Some of them need further
discussion.

Nova Hyper-V driver fails to detach virtual hard disks when using
the virtualizaton v1 WMI namespace. This affects Windows Server
2008 as well as Windows Server 2012 when the old namespace is used.

The reason is that it cannot find the attached resource,
using the wrong resource object connection attribute.

attribute when attempting to find an attached virtual disk resource
by its path.

Otherwise, it's possible to end up with a duplicate package definition,

Delete vm fails on Windows Server 2008R2 with the following error:

This is happening because on Windows 2008R2 it takes a while (1-2 sec. )
for Hyper-V to delete the instance specific files that it stores in the
instance folder.

This patch fixes this bug by adding a retry in the delete method if
it gets that specific error: WindowsError 145

Delete vm fails on Windows Server 2008R2 with the following error:

[Error 145] The directory is not empty: 'C:\\OpenStack\\Instances\\instance-00000003'

This is happening because on Windows 2008R2 it takes a while (1-2 sec. )
for Hyper-V to delete the instance specific files that it stores in the
instance folder.

This patch fixes this bug by adding a retry in the delete method if
it gets that specific error: WindowsError 145

The infra scripts for interacting with our translation server
(transifex) need pot files in the projects to work correctly.

These pot files have been generated using the same method as the infra
scripts.

Note that the infra scripts expect locale files in directory $REPO/locale/, thus
setup.cfg was changed and the existing pot file moved around so that the
infra scripts find everything.

Any future updates of these files will be proposed by the OpenStack
Proposal Bot - including import of translated files once the translation team has
translated files in a sufficient way.

This patch removes the check when the inspector starts that ensures
that ironic is already running, because it could lead to problems when
bringing up services in a distributed environment where order and timing

Currently the only way for the client to print an events, alarms or
samples is to print the fields in a box-like structure in the command
line. This is fine for many use-cases, but if we want to automate things
in the command line, or pipe some specific field from the event (such as
the Event's raw data or the Sample's metadata) then being able to
specify which field will be exclusively printed becomes very useful.

Here's an example:

ceilometer sample-show $SAMPLE_ID -f metadata | python -m json.tool

The following would exclusively print the Sample's metadata (which is
already in JSON format) and the output could be nicely printed in the
command line for further inspection.

If rootwrap daemon fails to spawn then it's still logged as if it was
spawned due to process is wrapped by sudo that is actually spawned. That
is confusing when debugging. This patch moves the logging message after
it's re-checked whether process was actually spawned.

This change makes all of the keys now 2048 bits. This will help tests
with devices that are FIPS compliant and do not allow keys of 1024
bits. This is important for functional tests that use real devices.

The test code included two modules that provided example private key,

its samples and the keys.py file will now contain the keys to be used
for testing. Those keys are 2048 while utils was 1024.

This change brings back the original behaviour of validator sets,
which means each set will be tested separately. If any of the sets
passes all its validators, it will be accepted. If it passes none,
it will be rejected.

This allows multiple configurations to be served from the same
Anchor instance. For example multiple teams can configure separate
source ips allowed to apply for separate hostnames.

This patch adds reporting of the multiattach capability
in the lvm driver.   Currently the Cinder scheduler does filtering
on hosts at create time for the --allow-multiattach option being
passed into the create request from the client.   In order for someone
to be able to create an LVM volume that can do multiattach, the LVM
driver needs to report the capability.

This patch's purpose is to allow LVM volumes to be multiattachable
for the folks working on the Nova patches to get Nova to do multiattach.
Without this patch, they can't do end to end testing.

Since there's no synchronized access to configfs in rtslib it can happen
that rtstool or rtslib access an element that no longer exists because
it has been removed just in the middle of a loop by another Cinder
request.

This results in quite a different number of exceptions:
- .dump()
- KeyError
- IOError
- RTSLibError on storage_object

This patch synchronizes access to all rtstool calls that access or
modify configfs using utils.synchronized decorator.

Enabled by a new > 0 integer config value, ""servers_per_port"" in the
[DEFAULT] config section for object-server and/or replication server
configs.  The setting's integer value determines how many different
object-server workers handle requests for any single unique local port
in the ring.  In this mode, the parent swift-object-server process
continues to run as the original user (i.e. root if low-port binding
is required), binds to all ports as defined in the ring, and forks off
the specified number of workers per listen socket.  The child, per-port
servers drop privileges and behave pretty much how object-server workers
always have, except that because the ring has unique ports per disk, the
object-servers will only be handling requests for a single disk.  The
parent process detects dead servers and restarts them (with the correct
listen socket), starts missing servers when an updated ring file is
found with a device on the server with a new port, and kills extraneous
servers when their port is found to no longer be in the ring.  The ring
files are stat'ed at most every ""ring_check_interval"" seconds, as
configured in the object-server config (same default of 15s).

Immediately stopping all swift-object-worker processes still works by
sending the parent a SIGTERM.  Likewise, a SIGHUP to the parent process
still causes the parent process to close all listen sockets and exit,
allowing existing children to finish serving their existing requests.
The drop_privileges helper function now has an optional param to
suppress the setsid() call, which otherwise screws up the child workers'
process management.

The class method RingData.load() can be told to only load the ring
metadata (i.e. everything except replica2part2dev_id) with the optional
kwarg, header_only=True.  This is used to keep the parent and all
forked off workers from unnecessarily having full copies of all storage
policy rings in memory.

A new helper class, swift.common.storage_policy.BindPortsCache,
provides a method to return a set of all device ports in all rings for
the server on which it is instantiated (identified by its set of IP
addresses).  The BindPortsCache instance will track mtimes of ring
files, so they are not opened more frequently than necessary.

This patch includes enhancements to the probe tests and
object-replicator/object-reconstructor config plumbing to allow the
probe tests to work correctly both in the ""normal"" config (same IP but
unique ports for each SAIO ""server"") and a server-per-port setup where
each SAIO ""server"" must have a unique IP address and unique port per
disk within each ""server"".  The main probe tests only work with 4
servers and 4 disks, but you can see the difference in the rings for the
EC probe tests where there are 2 disks per server for a total of 8
disks.  Specifically, swift.common.ring.utils.is_local_device() will
ignore the ports when the ""my_port"" argument is None.  Then,
object-replicator and object-reconstructor both set self.bind_port to
None if server_per_port is enabled.  Bonus improvement for IPv6
addresses in is_local_device().

This PR for vagrant-swift-all-in-one will aid in testing this patch:
https://github.com/swiftstack/vagrant-swift-all-in-one/pull/16/

Also allow SAIO to answer is_local_device() better; common SAIO setups
have multiple ""servers"" all on the same host with different ports for
the different ""servers"" (which happen to match the IPs specified in the
rings for the devices on each of those ""servers"").

However, you can configure the SAIO to have different localhost IP
addresses (e.g. 127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2, etc.) in the ring and in the
servers' config files' bind_ip setting.

This new whataremyips() implementation combined with a little plumbing
allows is_local_device() to accurately answer, even on an SAIO.

In the default case (an unspecified bind_ip defaults to '0.0.0.0') as
well as an explict ""bind to everything"" like '0.0.0.0' or '::',
whataremyips() behaves as it always has, returning all IP addresses for
the server.

Also updated probe tests to handle each ""server"" in the SAIO having a
unique IP address.

For some (noisy) benchmarks that show servers_per_port=X is at least as
good as the same number of ""normal"" workers:

The approach of having a separate table for the Secret-Project
associations is being deprecated in favor of having a foreign key to the
Project model (as described in the blueprint). This commit is an initial
step towards that goal, so the following was done:

* Add the project_id to the Secret model.
* Enhance the logic in the repositories and plugin.resources in order to
  first search that new field, and if it doesn't work, fall back to the
  previous approach.
* Added the necessary code for the project_id to be filled for the
  secret.

Note that the association table approach still works and will be removed
in a subsequent commit.

pbr has extra sauce for correctly making installed cli tools not do
unneeded pkg_resources metadata checks (that can only end in tears) if
those scripts are installed via the console_script entry
point. heat-manage looks like it is ready to be used this way.

Other scripts should be converted in the future to avoid erroneous
errors due to library metadata mismatch, which these tools should not
care about.

There is a need to limit maximum size of a volume to levels
that the storage infrastructure can handle.
Setting a maximum limit on size of a volume also prevents
a tenant from creating large volumes that have not been tested
and certified to satisfy SLA objectives.

This feature allows admin to set volume size limit for a tenant.
Get default value for volume size limit via config.
The defaults will either come from the default values
set in the quota configuration option or via cinder.conf
if the user has configured default values for quotas there.

The per_volume_size_limit defaults to -1[""No Limit""] always
unless changed in cinder.conf by admin
