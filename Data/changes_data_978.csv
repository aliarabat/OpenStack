Setting path_mtu to reflect mtu for physical devices that handle traffic
issued from br-tun makes ml2 plugin to calculate mtu for tenant networks
properly, considering encapsulation headers. After that, calculated mtu
values can be propagated into instances (currently, only DHCP approach
is implemented; RA support for IPv6 subnets is under review).

This change allows to run tunnelled tenant networks in multinode when
underlying physical devices don't support jumbo frames.

Note: changing the default value in neutron would not be backwards
compatible, since it could slow down east-west tunnelled traffic in
clouds that run on jumbo-aware networks.

Also, the new functionality didn't work on the remote

This commit adds some more checks and fixes the local

Initially this was related to the case of the conductor where
consecutive lines had debug messages that I was interested in, in
debugging a problem. When there are more than one guest instance
running, multiple threads in the conductor causes these messages to
get intertwined. Which is a ""pain"".

In fixing this, I found some other problems, such as that
QuotaController had logging using the _ i18n function but didn't
actually import i18n (a problem waiting to happen) and that some were
missing useful information. These have been fixed as well.

I've addressed those as well. For the most part, this change replaces
multiple consecutive lines of logging at the same severity level with
a single line that creates a dictionary with all the information for
the message.

I did a general sweep of the code to look for cases where we used
LOG.debug with a message that was i18n'ed and for cases where we used
one of the other LOG. functions without an i18n'ed message and fixed
those as well ...

This reverts commit f27d7f776e8556d976f75d07c99373455106de52.

This change broke the gate due to causing timeouts. The
functionality needs to go through the normal deprecation before
being removed.

Method CONF.set_override to change config option's
value with designated value in unit test, but never check if the
designated vaule is valid. Each config option has a type like StrOpt,
BoolOpt, etc. StrOpt with parameter choices only allows values in set
of choices. In short, each config option has limitation for type
and value. In production code, oslo.conf can ensure user's input is
valid, but in unit test, test methods can pass if we use method
CONF.set_override without parameter enforce_type=True even we pass wrong
type or wrong value to config option. This commit makes sure calling
method CONF.set_override with enforce_type=True and fixes violations.

Note: We can't set enforce_type=True by default in oslo.config now, it
may break all project's unit test. We can switch enforce_type=True by
default when all project fix violations like this commit.

passed in and just pass things in (and they will be
used if needed) in a simpler manner.

Constraints use zuul-cloner which does not work in the release,
pre-release or post pipelines. Currently tarballs and other
jobs are broken because of this.

This patch changes the constraints templates in python-jobs for
the docs, tarball and branch-tarball jobs keeping the name
constraints in the title but removing the zuul-cloner macro from
the template. This is the quickest fix for the problem as the
jobs are used everywhere even though the names of the jobs are
not reflective of their action.

This change introduces a sync_store which holds only containers that
are enabled for sync. The store is implemented using a directory
structure that resembles that of the containers directory, but has
entries only for containers enabled for sync.
The store is maintained in two ways:
1. Preemptively by the container server when processing
PUT/POST/DELETE operations targeted at containers with
x-container-sync-key / x-container-sync-to
2. In the background using the containers replicator
whenever it processes a container set up for sync

Domain/cpu node in XML description of external snapshots now being
updated with an appropriate information from domain XML description when
'host-passthrough' cpu mode is selected. This is implemented in Snapshot
class from libvirt-driver module.

The reason why it was done is libvirt rejects calls for restoring VMs to
the states from external snapshots and redefining external snapshots
without specifying cpu model and vendor.
Currently libvirt does neither return cpu model and vendor when calling
getXMLDesc for snapshot object for domains with 'host-passthrough' cpu
mode selected nor accept additional flags for the mentioned method to
get such information.
Fortunately, this can be done using XMLDesc domain method by passing
VIR_DOMAIN_XML_UPDATE_CPU flag.

each other directly. This happens not only between internal networks,
but also between internal network and external network.

For networks not in the same address scope, network traffic can't go
to each other between internal networks. SNAT will still work
between external network and internal networks if they are not in the
same address scope.

For networks that are not in any explict address scope, they will be

Adds support for creating, viewing, and updating subnetpools with the
new 'is_default' property.

This feature will be used by OpenStack admins to manage the default
subnetpools used by their tenants.

This feature replaces the old configuration options for default subnetpools
so that the neutron service no longer needs to be restarted after changes.

Creating a new default subnetpool is achieved by adding the flag:
'--is-default True' to the subnetpool-create call. For example:

neutron subnetpool-create --pool-prefix 10.0.0.0/24 --is_default True

The above will result in the creation of a new default subnetpool, only if a
default does not already exist for the given IP version. Only one default may
exist for each IP version. Similarly, 'is-default True' and
'--is-default False' can be used when calling subnetpool-update.

This feature can only be used by the cloud admin. All users can see the
is_default value in subnetpool-list and subnetpool-show.

Includes release notes.

Currently, the list returned in the Ceph driver contains a lot of

and not 1.

Using a set() avoids that issue and the memory draining implied.

When a client calls list assignment API what is returned is the
role id, user id or group id, and project id or domain id. Most users
then call the api again for each of these entities to get their names,
creating many api calls between the client and server.  This can
be reduced by having the server do all the work instead.

This commit adds the functionality to include the user, role, group,
project, and domain names with the response if the parameter
'include_names' is set to True.

This change will allow users (or ironic-inspector) to provide
several possible profiles for a node by setting capabilities like
XXX_profile (where XXX = compute, controller...).

Two new commands are added:

 openstack overcloud profiles match

    When no enough nodes with a given profile are found, this command
    will inspect nodes with such capabilities and choose missing nodes
    from them.

 openstack overcloud profiles list

    Lists all available and active nodes with their profiles and possible
    profiles.

See the following thread for the full background:
http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-November/078884.html

This changes refactores profile validation code in the deploy command to use
the same logic as commands above. It's worth noting that this change also
removes an incorrect assumption that a node can have multiple values
for the same capability. It also makes sure we only take active and available
nodes into account for all calculations.

There is a temp registry pattern [1] where you can backup the object
registry, register a class locally, and then restore the original
registry. This could be used for test objects that do not need to be
registered permanently but will have calls which lookup registration.
The FakeResource object in patch [2] is such a use case.

This change is to wrap the pattern rather than accessing
oslo.versionedobjects library internals.

For a long time now if you don't configure memcache then auth_token
middleware would cache the tokens in process memory.

This is not the job of auth_token middleware. If you need to cache
you should configure memcache otherwise auth_token will authenticate
with keystone for every token request.

With the new RPC calls get_devices_details_and_failed_devices
and update_device_list the agent gets a list of devices
for which some operation failed. The agent can now make use
of this information and instead of syncing all the devices
can sync only those which failed.
With the current change if a device keeps failing, the agent
will try to sync it forever. In a following patch I will limit
the number of retrials.

This allows functions that do not accept bodies to define this in the
router file. As currently many requests will cause a 500 if a body is
supplied when the API request does not expect it.

This currently only affects the core parts of the v2 api, that is,
calls to v2/images and v2/schemas. It does not cover the ""tasks"" API
or the metadefs api as I was keeping this patch concise. As this
does not affect the behaviour if not included this makes no change to
the metadefs api behaviour.

Currently, the upper constraints are using the ""==="" which means that
they are not upper constraint, but the actual version that pip is going
to install. It's not an _upper_ bound.

Let's use <= as an operator to be able to install lower version.

This is currently a problem in Gnocchi/Heat/Ceilometer/Aodh integration
gate as it forces keystonemiddleware===4.0.0 whereas Gnocchi wants <4
and other projects are good with >=2.3: so everybody is compatible, but
this file breaks this good intention.

Bifrost automatically installed the latest pip, primarily for cases
where pip was not present.  Instead of automatically doing this each
time, we will utilize the pre-existing pip package, and if it is
unavailable, we will install an appropriate version.

Changes in the requiremnets file, beyond removal of pip, are to
facilitate the re-alignment with global requirements as the changed
entry in question pulled in one of the packages that initially
caused issues for pip 8.

WIP

POC for scalable backup service blueprint spec:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/203215/

This commit decouples backup and volume services so that they
can run on separate nodes.  It also lays groundwork for enabling
multiple backup processes to run in parallel, and to do so on
either a single node or on multiple nodes.

Implements: bp scalable-backup-service

For a long time now if you don't configure memcache then auth_token
middleware would cache the tokens in process memory.

This is not the job of auth_token middleware. If you need to cache you
should configure memcache otherwise auth_token will authenticate with
keystone for every token request.

Claiming and allocation logic of the pci devices will be changed to
reflect the relationship between VFs and PFs.

PFs cannot be claimed or assigned if one of it's dependent VFs is
not available. As well as, all of the dependent VFs should become
UNAVAILABLE when the PF is successfully claimed/assigned.

In the same way, VF cannot be claimed or assigned when it's related
PF is assigned. In case of a successful claim/assignment of a VF,
the PF should become UNAVAILABLE.

In general, all virtual function object should disappear from PCI
and be removed from the stats, when PF is assigned. The above logic
will serve as a precaution step.

Since Physical Functions are pemitted for pci passthrough, some
operations will require an access to a database to retrive the

An access to a database requires a context, which in not always

token validation(s). This should both offload/speedup validations

Allocation of network interfaces for an instance can result in
corruption of the instance info cache. The result is that the cache
may contain duplicate entries for network interfaces. This can cause
instance boot failure. This bug appears to be attributable to the
combined effects of the fixes for bugs #1467581 and #1407664.

This change reverts the fix for bug #1407664, whilst keeping a
modified version of the unit test that was added with it. It also
adds a second unit test.

This is needed if you want to run devstack using tunnelling for tenant
networks as well as multiple nodes. In this case, packets get additional
encapsulation header, and if packets are of physical device mtu size,
tunnelled data can be dropped, especially when ""Dont Fragment"" (DF) flag
is set.

MTU is currently advertised using DHCP option only. It works as long as
guests know how to handle it. (Cirros honors the option as of 0.3.4).

Note this patch is Liberty only. For Mitaka, we plan to change the
default value for the option to True (see the dependency). We won't be
able to backport the neutron patch to stable release since it violates
stable maintenance rules.

This API samples test was not using testscenarios properly,
and it wasn't extending the correct test class, so it was:

1. Not actually running tests.
2. Not running tests at the correct microversion (v2.13).

This fixes the testscenarios setup for the subclass and the
API samples and templates (since it's not using subs for the
intended project_id that was in the samples).

Also fixes a typo in ApiSampleTestBaseV21.

The Icon used for delete actions was inconsistent with the rest
of the application. Also the lack of whitespace between icon
and text mean the rendering was quite compressed and ugly.

The alignment of the text button and drop-down button was broken
due to both having ""pull-right"" which has been fixed.

There is no need to have a bare <span class=""fa""> here, it
serves no rendering purpose. Nor the doubling up of btn-default
and btn-danger in actions-delete-selected template.

I removed the elements of unit testing that enforced a specific
styling in the templates, as that is unnecessary and potentially
burdensome to future developers wishing to change the styling.

I removed the ""btn-sm"" class that was unncessary at least
in default theme under Chrome, and if sizing is actually desired
then it may be achieved through other means (a mixin or scss @extend).

DRAC specific code from Ironic is moving to its own project, to
python-dracclient project. This patch continues refactoring code in
Ironic to use the new library.

Note that this is a backwards incompatible change. In addition to the
dependency change, return values of the following methods changed in
ironic.drivers.modules.drac.vendor_passthru:
- set_bios_config returns the 'commit_required' key
- commit_bios_config returns the 'job_id' and 'reboot_required' keys
- abandon_bios_config returns nothing

roles within the OSA deployment repository, the default Ansible role
directory, or within the /etc/openstack_deploy configuration directory.

Puppet OpenStack is having quite often some bundle issues when pulling
gems from rubygems servers.
Sometimes it's due to random timeouts or git failures.

This patch aims to add a retry when running 'bundle install', like it's
already done for some other jobs.

a new router interface is added, the appliance errors because its

Methods _create_ha_network, add_ha_port don't have wrapping
transaction in them, so they are prone to race conditions.
This commit adds a transaction to them. To avoid problem with
rolling back outmost transaction during exception handling,
internal methods have been wrapped in nested transaction.

Nested transaction is required in places like this:

def create():
      create_something()
      try:
            _do_other_thing()
      except Exception:
             with excutils.save_and_reraise_exception():
                     delete_something()

def _do_other_thing():
     with context.session.begin(subtransactions=True):
         ....

When exception is raised in _do_other_thing it
is caught in except block, but the object cannot be deleted in
except section because internal transaction has been rolled back.

A new method safe_creation and has been added
that provides a common way of handling such situations.

This commit fixes two issues, which make the client work with Python
3.4 and still being compatible with Python 2.7. The first issue is,
that the command line args somehow become a Map instead of list in
Python 3.4. I fixed it by explicitly making argv (sys.argv) a list.
The second issue is in the httpclient.py, where the values of a http
response are of type byte, which cannot be joined by join method of
string. I fixed it by decoding byte to utf-8 string. Additional if
statement satisfies wrong Python 3.4 test behavior.

Previously, the assertValidUnscopedTokenResponse method only
ensured specific attributes were in the token response. These
checks didn't ensure that the token scope never grew.

This change makes it so that the assertion will fail if extra
attributes are added to the token response. This should help
us be more aware of changes that have token response data
creep by building the check into the tests.

This is implemented using the existing jsonschema work that
keystone has for validating API requests.

Updates all repo SHAs to open up work on 11.2.8

This patch includes a normalisation of file names and updates
of paste, policy and rootwrap configurations.

It also updates tempest.conf.j2 to replace ssh_auth_method with
auth_method, and change auth_method to 'keypair' (configured is no
longer an a valid option).

The locally held temporary pin for django-compressor has been
removed as https://review.openstack.org/265025 is included in the
updated OpenStack sources.

Some projects name their paste config files with an underscore
instead of a dash. This patch ensures that the source-branch-updater
includes those files too when checking for updates.

The OpenStack updates include the following CVE fixes:

- OSSA-2016-001: Nova host data leak through snapshot

- OSSA-2016-002: Xen connection password leak in logs via StorageError

collector won't ever clean it up.

The socket leak comes in because the generator *also* refers to the
request's WSGI environment, which contains wsgi.input, which
ultimately refers to a _socket object from the standard
library. Python's _socket objects only close their underlying file

The from_nova_instance method on the InstanceInfo
class creates a dependancy on the nova object model.

The os_vif library is intended for use by any
compute layer, not just nova, so this method
should live in Nova codebase instead.

There is a duplicate package of pip-and-vitrualenv in dib elements as
well as in triple-image-elements. Adding the dib elements before the
tripleo elements in the ELEMENTS_PATH environment variable will allow
dib to find its own element first instead of the of tripleo
element. The tripleo element for pip-and-virtualenv need an update to
work right. This will make sure that we are using the common set of
elements before the tripleo elements in the future.

While thinking about the type=Resource changes that we're undergoing, a
common type that we could be improving for users are timestamps. If a
user is going to use a timestamp for anything -- the common ones being
the timestamp of when a resource was created or updated -- they're going
to need to convert it to a datetime anyway in order to look into it.

By far the most common timestamp format coming back in responses and
being accepted in requests is an ISO 8601 string. We had previously been
depending on the oslo_utils.timeutils library to handle a form of this
type of behavior for the metric resource, but it was limited in its
functionality as well as only being used by metric. This approach makes
the idea more generally useful.

Additionaly, this approach can be applied to the BoolStr class which had
previously existed to handle the case of some services returning ""true""
and ""false"" in responses. This required a special case inside the prop
code to look for a ""parsed"" attribute. Changing the BoolStr class to
work with the Formatter base allows both BoolStr and ISO8601 to use the
same code paths.

This change doesn't make any wholesale changes to implement
type=format.ISO8601. Those should be handled in a separate change once
the implementation is approved.
