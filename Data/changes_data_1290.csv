This patch introduces DB mappings between neutron and NSX router,
thus not requiring anymore the Neutron router ID to be equal to the
NSX one.

This change is needed for enabling asynchronous operations in
the NSX plugin.

This patch also performs NVP/NSX renaming where appropriate, and
fixes delete router logic causing a 500 HTTP error to be returned
when a Neutron internal error occurs.

Ported from nova: Iecd6fadb2b653f4ccbe75882c2ef85812b334e8d

Added log messages for cloud operators so that they can tell when an
attempt to turn a device on or off via IPMI has failed after the
configured number of attempts.

This should help operators diagnose issues on devices that respond
slowly to IPMI commands. The failure to repeatedly change the device
power state is now logged precisely along with the cause, where
before operators had to diagnose the issue through trace log captures.

Instead of storing the endpoints as a single admin credentials dictionary
(containing the username, password etc.) we should be able to store several
endpoints which can be possibly returned from the deploy object, as well as
the information whether these endpoints have the admin permission or not.
If not, then the deployment is going to be used with the predefined set of
users (that will be implemented next). If there is an admin endpoint, then
the users for benchmarking will be generated (the ""admin"" role).
This information now gets stored in a dictionary of form:

    ""endpoints"": [
        {""username"": ..., ""password"": ...,
         ""tenant_name"": ..., ""auth_url"": ..., ""permission"": ""admin|user""},

This commit removes the 'cat tempest.config' from lib/tempest. There
is no reason to cat it as part of running devstack because the file
is and can be interacted with after devstack finishes running. To
prevent a loss of information in the gate this change should be
coupled with devstack-gate change: Ifb36918cd0d686cb3865f5322cd62c209acaaf30
which copies the tempest.config file with the other test artifacts.

As of commit 4676d823a8a35 to Ironic, the API for changing Node power
state no longer returns a body. With no return body, there is nothing
to print in the CLI after requesting the power state change.

This patch removes the print-out of an empty table when the CLI
set-node-power-state command is issued.

reserve lock, start the background task and return empty response to

As part of commit 5668870, we now explicitly guard against the case
free_disk_gb is None or unset. However, this should never happen
since resource tracker always sets it and guarding against this case
isn't actually needed to fix the bug in question.

Also, simplify the code a little to make the intent more clear. We
assume that free_disk_gb is always set, but we want to use
disk_available_least where the driver has set it. The case where
disk_available_least is less than free_disk_gb is the exceptional
case we want to guard against.

was proving to be problematic when used with
the new Fedora constistent network naming
convention rules (em1, em2, etc.). We aren't using

need to soon and when we do udev rules seem to be the
best way to avoid racy behaviour when calling

In order to distinguish file size from the virtual image size, we need
to add a new field to the Image model to represent that. This patch adds
a new field called `virtual_size` to the Image model and the migration
for it.

The existing size attribute is kept as is in order to keep backwards
compatibility. Most of the users consider that attribute to be the
physical image size, which is what we're trying to achieve here.

The API implementation will be done in a follow-up patch.

Although this code error is part of the `ping_listener` tests, it was
missing from the list of known - and ignored - connection errors.

The code error 2013 refers to a connection lost during a query, see:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/error-messages-client.html#error_cr_server_lost

Without this error code, the session won't try to reconnect to mysql,
which makes `max_retries` useless.

Previously NEC plugin compares old and new datapath_ids as

recreation of a port on OpenFlow controller. This patch fixes
this issue by comparing datapath_ids as hex int.

This removes `setenforce 0` from boothook.sh, creating a custom user
and adding them to sudoers in favour of just defaulting to the user
that comes with cloud-init for each specific distro.

The downside is that we no longer have the same cross-distro username
(ec2-user by default), instead it's whatever the distro ships
(""fedora"" on Fedora 19+, ""ubuntu"" on Ubuntu 12.04+ and ""cloud-user"" on
CentOS/RHEL). However, it's easy to add a new user via a Heat
template.

The upside is that SELinux is set up correctly without us having to do
anything (specifically no 0.6.9 vs. 0.7.2 cloud-init version
incompatibilities) and we ship less code while being more robust.

Tested on Fedora 20, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 13.10, CentOS 6.5 and
RHEL 6.5 cloud images.

The storage changes to use a read/write lock provide locking
guarantees that we do not need to duplicate in the underlying
storage.

This is predicated on the fact that we do the following:

1. A user before running upgrades the schema of there backend
   before giving the logbook/backend to the engine. This means
   that the backend upgrade() method does not need to be
   thread safe.
2. One engine working on one logbook at a given time.
3. An engine accesses and uses the logbook and its flow/task
   details by accessing data via the storage accessor interface.
4. Tasks do not currently get direct access to storage or the
   underlying logbook while running (in the future we could
   provide access to a storage object, but we would need to have
   a contract that ensures a task can not hijack an engines usage
   of storage by deadlocking the engine).

Starting an HAProxy instance for ceilometer-api (and possibly other
similar services) will fail on Ubuntu if the package for that service is
installed but not yet configured: the service is still running in its
default configuration binding to 0.0.0.0 instead of just the management
IP, preventing HAProxy from binding to the management VIP on the same
port.

To prevent a dependency loop (Ceilometer, like most other OpenStack
services, depends on MySQL), Galera dependencies have to be narrowed
down from the whole of HAProxy setup to just the registration of MySQL
service with it. HAProxy related parts of controller_ha and galera
classes are refactored to support reloading HAProxy for each service
independently, and to group together HAProxy options specific to
individual services.

To support granular addition of services into HAProxy, haproxy module
updated to puppetlabs-haproxy 1.0.1 (0d4c50e) and refactored to split
haproxy.cfg into multiple files under /etc/haproxy/conf.d using include
directive as implemented in the patch by Brane F. Gračnar:

http://marc.info/?l=haproxy&m=129235503410444

The define_backends option for haproxy class introduced in Fuel is
renamed to define_backups and ported to the new haproxy module.

Support for selecting exported haproxy::balancermember resources by tag
is dropped since it is no longer used (and not relevant since Fuel no
longer runs puppetmaster).

An ordered list of controllers is passed from osnailyfacter::cluster_ha
to openstack::controller_ha so that haproxy::balancermember always sets
the primary controller as the active server in failover configurations.

HAProxy is now configured as part the ""main"" stage, so ""cluster_head""
stage is no longer necessary. MySQL and RabbitMQ listen blocks are
populated before HAProxy is first started, other listen blocks are added
incrementally with HAProxy being reloaded via OCF. In HA mode, all
dbsync invokations now require HAProxy MySQL (Ceilometer and Heat were
missing), and all OpenStack services now require HAProxy Keystone.

HAProxy configuration for RadosGW is changed from active-passive
failover to active-active load balancing between controller nodes.
Backend IP addresses for RadosGW servers are changed from storage to
internal.

HAProxy mode option handling is cleaned up so that the default ""http""
mode now propagates properly for listening services that do not specify
""tcp"" mode explicitly.

Syslog facility for Ceilometer changed from SYSLOG to LOG_SYSLOG to
catch up to the cleanup done in LP #1263675.

Added ""--no-class_inherits_from_params_class-check"" to puppet-lint
options to prevent it from issuing a warning that is not relevant for
Puppet versions 2.7 and newer.

Neutron client expects token to be passed as token= argument, while
neutron-metadata-agent passes auth_token= instead. This effectively makes the
client to authenticate against keystone each time it's instantiated. In
neutron-metadata-agent case, it means 'each time a client sends a metadata
request.'

The issue results in high cpu utilization on keystone side when simultaneously
invoking multiple nova instances with cloud-init.

Don't assume environment.d is always under /tmp/in_target.d. This makes
dib-run-parts more flexible, and less specific to diskimage-builder. For
instance, dib-run-parts is already used by os-refresh-config, but
/tmp/in_target.d/environment.d is never going to exist when it's called
by os-refresh-config.

This is useful b/c elements can now install os-refresh-config scripts
under /opt/stack/os-config-refresh/environment.d to influence how
further scripts are run. Specifically, the OpenSuse packages prepend the
OpenStack user accounts with ""openstack-"". Instead of checking for which
users exists with an if/else in all the os-refresh-config scripts that
need to do user related things, we can just update the scripts to use
$NOVA_USER, etc. The OpenSuse element can then install a file under
/opt/stack/os-config-refresh/environment.d to set NOVA_USER to
openstack-nova. We could have files that declare defaults as well within
each specific element, or just set a default variable at the top of each
os-refresh-config script.

As the code checks that a server become active before moving to the
next one, the amount of time spent checking a server should be
subtracted from the global timeout.

Otherwise there will be a non negligible possibility that a server
would take a period longer than the specified timeout to boot.

There appear to be no tests for retrieving certificates from the v2 api.

When you return a string from a webob request it inserts it as the body

standard encoding behaviours in wsgi are not enforced and and all
responses are returned as straight text/html.

We can't change the behaviour of the certificate retrieval because it

Most entities have disable events that need to trigger other actions.
While disable is often a part of a update event, they are
semantically different events.

One alternative is to have the listener do a lookup, coupling it
tightly to the disabled entity. Sending a deliberate event is a
clearer indication of intention.

These notifications are internal only.

This bug fix addresses bug #1267168, adding a default value to the
optional control_location parameter for the encryption-type-create
command. Prior to this fix, any invocation of encryption-type-create
that omitted the control_location parameter would fail. The failure
arose from the expectations of the cinder volume encryption type
API extension, which expects to always receive a value for the
control_location on encryption type creation.

control_location indicates which service will conduct the volume
encryption for the encryption-type under consideration; valid options
are 'front-end' (i.e., nova) and 'back-end' (i.e., cinder). The new
default value is 'front-end' and is used whenever control_location
is omitted from encryption-type-create invocation. For prior
discussion and information, see the abandoned patch below:

Most of the DB exceptions contain DB details which aren't caught by the
traceback hook. The cleanest way to ensure the proper error codes and
messages are being sent is to catch the DBErrors and wrap them as
IronicExceptions. This patch will show the DB details if debug is enabled,
but hides them behind a generic message if debug is False.

This module generates and inserts a patch component of the semantic version
stamp for Barbican, intended to ensure that a strictly monotonically increasing
version is produced for consecutive development releases. Some repositories
such as yum use this increasing semantic version to select the latest
package for installations.

Previously list operations in ovs_lib returns an empty list
if RuntimeError occurs and a caller cannot distinguish an error
from normal results. This commit changes ovs_lib list operations
(get_vif_port_set, get_vif_ports, get_bridges) to raise an
exception when RuntimeError occurs.

Note: callers of these commands are ovs/nec/ryu-agent and ovs_cleanup.
- plugin agents: these commands are inside in try/except clause
  in daemon loop and there is no need to change.
- ovs_cleanup: there is no error catch logic in main() at now
  and it calls commands other than ovs_lib, so it can be cleanup
  later if required.

It also fixes the code to use excutils.save_and_reraise_exception
when reraising an exception.

The --volume-type argument should be rejected when --source-volid
or --snapshot-id are used, and the parent type-id just picked up
and used.  Then the user can retype if desired.

Auto failing this strictly causes backward compatability issues though
so we'll just check for a mismatch and raise an exception in that case.
This way if the user knows what they're doing and they're explicit
in the command we still allow it and things are fine.

Savanna supports is MapReduce.Streaming.  The Streaming subtype
distinguishes it from a regular MapReduce job and indicates a
difference in the Oozie workflow generation and required configuration

This patch adds that ability, with a custom mapper route to
keystone.catalog.controllers.RegionsV3.create_region_with_id.
When implementing, I also noticed an issue with an unused

This setting allows changing the way libvirt stores ephemeral disk
images.  Possible settings are lvm, rbd, qcow2, raw and default.

When you pick ""default"", nova will use qcow2 when use_cow_images is
true. This cookbook does not handle that value, its default is true, so
default and qcow2 actually means the same thing here.  (There's no harm
done, I think.)

It includes additions to the README, specs and small cosmetic changes to

Because we were using a python tempfile the reviewday.json
file was readable/writable only by the user that runs
bin/reviewday. Ideally this file would be world readable so
that Apache can host it properly.

In this commit we drop the use of python tempfile in
favor of just plain old open() which respects the
normal file permission settings.

eventlet's wsgi server has a debug mode. This triggers in 3 cases:

1) returning a stack trace to the user on 500 error
2) printing 'accepted'... on every wsgi request
3) printing timeout on time out scenarios

In a real OpenStack environment #2 is basically what we see, all
the time, on *every* request. This ends up adding a lot of log
spam at INFO level.

Future eventlet will use real python logging, which will let us
log the debug messages at DEBUG level, but until then we should
clean out the logs to be vaguely sane.

3) The name ""to_bytes"" didn't do a good job representing what the function does.

Volumes and backups managers' methods are decorated with
`require_initialized_driver` which checks whether the driver has been
initialized or not. The decorator fails with a `DriverNotInitialized`
exception if the driver hasn't been initialized.

This early failure leaves volumes and backups in a wrong status which is
not just confusing for the user but it also makes it difficult to do
anything with the resources after they've been left in a 'bogus' status.

For example, when a volume creation is requested, the volume is first
created in the database and its status is set to 'creating'. Then the
scheduler will pick an available volume node and send the task to it. If
the driver has not been initialized, the volume status will be left as
'creating' instead of 'error'.

This patch fixes that issue by moving the driver initialization check
into the various manager's methods. In some cases this check is done at
the very beginning of the method, in some others - either to avoid code
duplication or because the lines above the check made sense to be
executed first - this check is done later in the method.

NOTE: Regardless the conflicts noted below, this patch should be
backported. The issue it fixes is a source of several bug reports, user
frustration and confusion. The conflicts were related to some additions
in the master branch. Resolving the conflicts was pretty
straightforward.

This eliminates the need to do a get on each token in the user's index
on token issuance. This change will change the maximum number of tokens
that can be outstanding for a given user. This change is two-fold, first
instead of using JSON to store the token IDs, the python list structure
is being stored in memcached; second the expiry for the token is also
stored in the list. The net result is that fewer tokens can be stored
in the user's token index list due to an increase in data being stored
per token in the index page.

The new logic will attempt to upgrade the old json-style lists to
the new format of [(token_id, expiry), ...] stored as a native
python object in the memcache backend. This conversion will keep
any outstanding tokens in the list from (<time_of_conversion> +
<configured expiration of tokens>). This is done to ensure that
tokens can still be invalidated by operations that invalidate
tokens based upon user/project/trust/etc changes without causing
potential lockups in keystone trying to retrieve all of the
actual token expiration times from memcache.

Simplify rest client bases into a single base client class.
There is a lot of duplicated code in the way the REST client classes are
constructed to enable both JSON and XML requests. Duplicate code leads
to subtle errors and inconsistencies in the way that
service client classes behave.
This patch aims to simplify the class hierarchy for the REST client classes
by making the XML service client class inherit from
the JSON service client class.

Steps to use one xml-client:
1) json-service-clients inherit rest-client
2) xml-service-clients inherit json-service-clients
3) redefine option self.TYPE for xml-service-clients
4) use new method self.get_headers() instead option self.headers,
if needed, but in most cases there is no need to set up headers
at all in service clients.

This is feature patch (3 of 3) that introduces support for
transitioning existing NSX-based deployments from the agent
based model of providing dhcp and metadata proxy services
to the new agentless based mode. In 'combined' mode, existing
networks will still be served by the existing infrastructure,
whereas new networks will be served by the new infrastructure.

Networks may be migrated to the model using a new CLI tool
provided, called 'neutron-nsx-manage'. Currently the tool
provides two admin-only commands:

  neutron-nsx-manage net-report <net-id-or-name>

This will check that the network can be migrated and returns
the resources currently in use. And:

  neutron-nsx-manage net-migrate <net-id-or-name>

This will move the network over the new model and deallocate
resources from the agent. Once a network has been migrated
there is no turning back.

This commit adds a skip to the services decorators. Previously the
decorator was used solely to add an attr to the test_id that specified
which services the test exercised. However, this attr also specifies
which services need to be enabled to run the test. So if a service tag
is set then the decorator will raise a skip exception if the services
specified are not enabled.

Unlike libvirt where the image files are needed for running VM's, Nova
baremetal copies them to the remote machine, after which they are no
longer needed. Keeping them sharply reduces the scalability of Nova
baremetal by limiting a single nova-compute to deploy instances whose
disk size sums to it's local disk - but really only needs to be a
concurrency limitation + the kernel/ramdisk files, which are stored
separately.

Recent change (Ifd523ac5e9039861cf87711dc5c4842b5cb524c2)
moved the quota check on extend_volume to the API layer
in order to provide feedback to caller if the quota check
failed.

The problem is that change still sets the volume status to
error_extending if the quota check fails.  There's no reason
to do this if we're now giving immediate feedback that the call
failed.

I'm also unclear on what the purpose of adding the reservations
to the rpc call are, but I'll double check on that before changing.

This patch leaves most of the previous change in place but
removes the setting of error_extending to the volumes status
on the quota fail.

This patch is a first cut at adding erasure_coding type
policy support to the Swift proxy handler for HTTP PUT
requests.

Terminology:

 - object chunks: HTTP chunks received over wire
 - object segments: consecutive HTTP chunks buffered up to
   a min threshold for erasure coding before they are erasure
   coded
 - EC fragments: data and parity fragments generated when
   erasure coding transformation is applied to object segments
 - EC archive: concatenation of EC fragments
 - ec_k - number of EC data fragments
 - ec_m - number of EC parity fragments

Design notes and Assumptions:

 - Swift requires PyECLib for erasure code primitives
   (Hosted at PyPI)

 - Rough flow of operations -

   - Proxy opens (ec_k + ec_m) backend requests to object servers
   - Proxy buffers HTTP chunks up-to a minimum segment size
     (defined at 1MB to start with)
   - Proxy feeds the assembled segment to PyECLib's encode() to
     get ec_k + ec_m fragments
   - Proxy sends the (ec_k + ec_m) fragments to the object servers
     to be _appended_ to the previous set
   - Proxy then continues with the next set of HTTP chunks

   - Object servers store objects which are EC archives (their
     contents are the concatenation of erasure coded fragments)
   - Object metadata changes: for 'etag', we store the md5sum
     of the EC archive object, as opposed to the non-EC case
     where we store md5sum of the entire object

 - Assumptions around PyECLib -

   - PyECLib gurantees generation of equal-size data/parity fragments
     with appropriate padding
   - PyECLib generates a unique header for each erasure code fragment
     it generates on encode()
   - PyECLib store a digest with each erasure coded fragment for
     integrity checking

Changes:

 - Proxy HTTP PUT request handling changes
   - Intercept EC request based on policy type
   - Validate ring replica count against (ec_k + ec_m)
   - Calculate EC quorum size for min_conns
   - Call into PyEClib to encode to client_chunk_size sized
     object chunks to generate (ec_k + ec_m) EC fragments.
   - Queue chunk EC fragments for writing to nodes

Under construction:

 - Unit test code

StoragePolicy/PolicyConfig now controls the number of
replica when the policy type is 'replication' or the number
of data/parity fragments for the 'erasude_coding' policies.
quorum_size being a function of one of those attributes,
belongs to the StoragePolicy class.

Changes:

 - Move quorum_size() from utils to StoragePolicy
 - Update callers of quorum_size() to reflect this change
 - Update quorum_size() unit test code

When resizing an instance's flavor, Trove asks the guest to start the
datastore via an RPC call and then, to be safe, would check the
service_status table in the database to make sure it was updated to
RUNNING. The thing is, that second check was not only superfluous, it
was causing resizes to fail in the post-conductor world, because while
the guest would have sent a message to conductor describing the
datastore's current state before it informed taskmanager that it had
finished the call, conductor itself might not have updated the
database. This commit changes things so taskmanager polls until the
service_status is RUNNING after calling the guest. If there is an error
the call to the guest will fail anyway.

This eliminates the need to do a get on each token in the user's index
on token issuance. This change will change the maximum number of tokens
that can be outstanding for a given user. This change is two-fold, first
instead of using JSON to store the token IDs, the python list structure
is being stored in memcached; second the expiry for the token is also
stored in the list. The net result is that fewer tokens can be stored
in the user's token index list due to an increase in data being stored
per token in the index page.

The new logic will attempt to upgrade the old json-style lists to
the new format of [(token_id, expiry), ...] stored as a native
python object in the memcache backend. This conversion will keep
any outstanding tokens in the list from (<time_of_conversion> +
<configured expiration of tokens>). This is done to ensure that
tokens can still be invalidated by operations that invalidate
tokens based upon user/project/trust/etc changes without causing
potential lockups in keystone trying to retrieve all of the
actual token expiration times from memcache.
