Neutron itself has all of its tests in neutron/tests, as do 2/3 of
the projects in OpenStack. There are a wealth of reasons to put
them in the package, not the least of which that tests/__init__.py
implies a code living in a global namespace called tests.

ddt stands for data-driven-tests, and it's also a Python module.
It adds the test data as a decorator to the test methods, so that
the test code can focus on each type of behaviors instead of using
`for` loops internally (on the other hand, you have to split big
tests which testing different types of behaviors into small tests).

Commit I788782a9f21ec2672551f75123753175bb268586 introduced some
changes into the add_host_to_aggregate() method to catch adding an
host to an availability zone when the host was already a member of
a different availability zone. However there were a couple of issues
with this change. There was no check that the availability_zone was
in the metadata grabbed from the database which would raise a
KeyError back to the api. Additionally, the check wouldn't always
work as expected because the database returned a set of availability
zones (including sometimes an empty set) so the check would fail in
some conditions when it was expected to pass.

This commit fixes the logic for checking if the host is already in an
availability zone. It also replaces the try/except block in the
aggregates extension to check up front if the action is valid instead
of waiting for a key error when it goes to use the action.

This patch makes it possible to use new BDM syntax (if it was used in
the request when booting) to be used when determining where to get the
metadata from.

Since the new syntax has the boot_index field - it is easy to determine
which device is intended to be booted from.

While the plug-in layer for the Swift backend storage processes is being
finalized, intermediate efforts have generally supplanted the top level
executable scripts with custom implementations that will typically deviate
only slightly from the stock implementation.  This approach is both flexible
and effective; however, because it is not well defined it has a side effect of
being incompatible with swift-init.

The optional command line argument --plugin-command-prefix for swift-init will
make it possible for swift-init to manage alternative top level Swift server
executable scripts which are compatible with the stock Swift processes by
appending an alternative prefix to the name of launched script.

For example, if you install an alternative swift-object-replicator
implementation at 'mybackend-object-replicator' you can start the process from
the command line using swift-init's config and pid management with the
command:

    swift-init -p mybackend object-replicator start

Currently, only InstanceGroup and AutoScalingGroup manages

applicable to other resource types. The resource validation
method is also overridden here to validate the UpdatePolicy.

Nova uses NetworkInfoAsyncWrapper to alloc network in an
async manner, and this allows one to start querying for
network info before you know you will need it. Nova will
invokes refresh_cache method to update instance_cache_info
after excuting the allocate_for_instance method as well.

But nova rest api will query allocate_for_instance table
directly, thus we will get the empty network info before
instance_cache_info table has been updated asynchronously.
The result is not deterministic,
but in the end the instance_info_cache will be consistent.

The patch will check network info in the method
wait_for_server_status to fix this issues.

Seems to make perfect sense that from_dict() would remove these extra

In one place, we use the full module path for the image.fake module and
in another place we simply use 'fake', however we only import the
latter. This appears to only work because of the common.rpc import which
results in nova.tests.image.fake being defined. This import is going
away with oslo.messaging, though.

Currently when adding an instance fault, the message field looks
for kwargs['value'], which many exceptions do not have.  This
results in the message field being set to the name of the
exception class, which in some cases is not useful (see the bug
report for an example).

This change puts the exception message in the message field, and
removes it from the details field since there's no need to put it

CinderExceptions were being unicode()'d when being wrapped in an
HTTPException, and this was causing the delayed translation to fail for
those errors.

Also, CinderExceptions have a 'message' class attribute that holds the
generic error message template, e.g. ""Backup  %(backup_id)s is not
found"", unfortunately, because the names are the same, it was
overshadowing the actual exception instance 'message', e.g. ""Backup 1 is
not found"", when translating. This patch puts the exception's actual

self.assertIn(('project_user_quotas_user_id_deleted_idx',

But we have no possibility to get the order of columns due to SQLA
issue in reflection of indexes for PostgreSQL.
See http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/ticket/2767
So columns order in `index_data` variable can be wrong and test
fails in such case.

To fix this we should store colums as sets (instead of lists) if
we run tests on PostgreSQL.

The fake_rabbit config option enables the memory transport for kombu.

We use the fake RPC backend for all of our unit testing. As best I can
tell, fake_rabbit harks back to a time when it was used for unit
testing.

The code in nova-dhcpbridge is the only place we explicitly do anything
different for this case - i.e. we directly call out to the network
manager to manage the IP address leases.

When we move to oslo.messaging, we can't rely on this config option
because it could be renamed in future. It's hard to imagine a more
generic ""is the transport going to actually send a message to a remote
server"" API in oslo.messaging.

I don't think anyone uses fake_rabbit anymore. I just don't see how it
can be useful to anyone. We should just remove it rather than putting in
a bunch of work to retain it with oslo.messaging.

pytz uses date based versioning which isn't supported by default:

In the confirm_resize method at the compute API level, the 'metadata' attribute
is used to notify the instance usage and the 'system_metadata' attribute is
needed to get the old/new instance type values and the old vm_state, but the
auto confirm periodic task doesn't get the instance object with these two
attributes. This results in 'KeyError' exception being raised when the auto
confirm periodic task runs.
This commit sets expected_attrs to get 'metadata' and 'system_metadata' when
retrieving the instance object in the _poll_unconfirmed_resizes compute manager
method.

Reproduce steps in my devstack env with latest master branch nova:
1. set resize_confirm_window=10 in nova.conf
2. create an instance
3. resize it
4. wait for it is confirmed and watch the log

The EC2 API supports glob-style wildcards in filters.

From http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-DescribeTags.html:

""You can use wildcards in a filter value. An asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters, and
a question mark (?) matches exactly one character. You can escape special characters using a
backslash (\) before the character. For example, a value of \*amazon\?\\ searches for the literal
string *amazon?\.""

This patch converts the glob-style regex to a python regex and uses re.match to do the rest. The
approach to the conversion was taken from the python fnmatch library.

In unit tests, many test class use tempfile.mkdtemp in SetUp and
shutil.rmtree in tearDown.

A common wrong case is putting test data in `testdir = os.join(mkdtemp() +
'some_class')` and `rmmtree(testdir)`. As a result, /tmp/xxx/some_class
was deleted, but /tmp/xxx is still leaved in system. So a proper fix is
`rmtree(os.path.dirname(testdir), ignore_errors=1)`

Any time the DHCP server is updated this code will maintain a default
route in the DHCP namespace using the gateway_ip attribute of the
first DHCP-enabled IPV4 subnet in the list of subnets where gateway_ip
is not None.  This strategy uses the same gateway ip that the DHCP
server hands to the VMs on the network.

Currently WSGI will accept very large templates. The raw size is
not much of a concern at 4MB, but parsing that template can create a
recursive memory consumption which leads to the API server eating up
extreme amounts of memory, sometimes leading to MemoryError. Assuming
the template could pass through the API to the engine, this would also
put a heavy burden on an engine and/or the RPC system as well.

Limiting the JSON portion of the body should prevent any large templates
from entering the system.

This patch introduces a new virt driver property
'need_legacy_block_device_info' that will tell the compute manager if
driver needs to be passed legacy block_device_info.

This patch also refactors the compute manager methods that would pass
the block device info to driver methods - to do so according to the
property of the driver. This is done by moving all the code into a single
private method _get_instance_volume_block_device_info. This method existed
before but now uses the new DriverBlockDevice classes for it's
functionality.

As it is sometimes necessary to refresh the connection info for volume
based DriverBlockDevice objects (a private manager method
_refresh_block_device_connection_info was used for this), this patch
also factors this code to a method on the DriverVolumeBlockDeviceClass,
and is now completely used like that when needed, and removes the said
method.

Finally - this patch removes a _get_block_device_info method from the
compute API class. This remained from early pre-conductor attempts to
remove DB access from the compute service, and is irrelevant now that
conductor is used. This is needed so that the source  of block device
data is always conductor and the version of data is always
known.

After this patch - it will be possible to implement changes in drivers
that will allow them to utilise the new block device data format.

found.  We fix this here by providing an elevated
context to the get_volume call when accepting the
transfer.

Closes-Bug: #1212772

ML2 doesn't support ext-gw-mode, resulting in L3 agents not
setting-up NAT rules in neutron routers (currently, l3 agents
will assume enable_snat=false if plugin doesn't provide this
parameter as described in bug 1212868)

This patchset adds the support of ext-gw-mode to ML2 plugin.

In order to support ext-gw-mode alembic migration (as well as
other potential migrations on plugin dbs), folsom_initial
migration script is fixed to include ML2 plugin. Otherwise
databases won't be set-up during migration script (but at
plugin startup by sqlalchemy), resulting in migration failures.

pbr is the libification of what was openstack.common.setup. If provides
the build information in a delcarative form, instead of as executable python
code, which works around the chicken and egg problem of needing setup
libraries present to run setup, but needing to run setup to tell if you
need setup libraries.

One of the features that comes along with this is versioning based on
git tags. If the current revision is a signed git tag, then that is the
version of the package. If it is not, the version is equal to the most
recent git tag, plus a commit count, plus a git sha (similar to git
describe, but scrubbed for python version rules compliance)

pbr updates are also part of the upcoming automation around ensuring
global requirements stay in sync.

This patch refactors how block devices are handled when booting VMs.
Also it introduces new block device mapping format in the run_instance
manager method of the compute service.

The refactoring is done by creating a simple hierarchy of
DriverBlockDevice classes that are meant to:

1) Provide a common place to keep information about the data that is
kept for each block device type

2) Encapsulate the logic of ""attaching"" the device from the compute
service point of view (driver will still need to do the actual work).

Currently we have special subclasses for ephemeral, swap, volume and
snapshot devices.

These classes also make it possible to easily provide
the drivers that will require old block device mapping format with it by
overriding the legacy() method.

Another advantage that this refactoring brings is that adding additional
block device types, like Image block devices (coming soon in a subsequent
patch) that can have destination type of either a hypervisor image or a
volume will be just a matter of extending the base class and redefining
attach to do the work of creating the volume if needed.

Nova sends notifications with a bunch of different publisher_ids, so we
instantiate quite a lot of Notifier objects. Loading the noification
drivers for each of these is a substantial amount of overhead.

One obvious answer would be to make publisher_id an argument to the
error(), info(), etc. methods, but I think it's nice to encapsulate the
publisher_id in a notifier instance.

Instead, add a prepare() method which mirrors the approach in RPCClient.
You use this method to create a specialized notifier instance with a new
publisher_id.

The change allows the Domain panel to be displayed even if the flag

A unified logging implementation from Oslo-incubator has been carried
over and implemented in Keystone. This is removing the old

Logging in Keystone is now implemented through

consistent with other logging implementations in OpenStack projects.

This patch makes the API part of the instance boot process rely on the
new BDM format. It adds additional validations that are enabled due to
using the new format.

Since the new format will allow to specify devices that will be created
as images on the hypervisor (if the hypervisor enables it), in order
to prevent a DOS, a new config option 'max_local_block_devices' was
added. This option allows the operator to set a limit on the number of
destination_type='local' block devices a user can specify per VM.

This patch also refactors and simplifies how block devices are handled
during boot, and makes sure that validation errors are caught and
transformed to expected HTTP errors.

Requeue the message instead of rejecting it. The AMQP spec
suggests reject()'ing the message to get it back in the queue.
The trick is that there is a parameter ""requeue=True"" required
to make this happen. Under kombu, this is done as a separate
command instead of a parameter on reject().

In order to preserve backwards compatibility with existing
callbacks (that may live outside of this library) the
delivery_info and signaling flag is passed in the message
payload.

The implication of catching the exceptions in the callback
is that we have to wait for all the consumers to return.
That is, we lose async on the callbacks. Fortunately, this
is only for the consumers that don't want ack_on_error
behavior.

delivery_info is additional message info included in the
message, but was getting dropped previously. This info is
useful to some consumers (like Ceilometer).

use_greenlets causes gevent to be needed. As per the docs:

""If you need to use standard Python threads in the same process as
Gevent and greenlets, run monkey.patch_socket(), rather than
monkey.patch_all(), and create a MongoClient with use_greenlets=True.
The MongoClient will use a special greenlet-aware connection pool.""

We do not use threads, so it seems like we're doing extra complexity
without needing it right now. Also, gevent is not python3 or pypy
compatible, so we'd be bringing in a dependency that would make things
harder moving forward.

The scheduler and the compute nodes currently keep track of disk,
memory and vcpu resource allocation. This includes reporting available
and allocated resource values, accounting for their consumption in the
scheduler's HostState class and gating acceptance of new instances at
the compute node in the Claims and ResourceTracker classes. It should
be noted that these are used to manage static resource allocation. They
are not dynamic resource utilization metrics.

Network bandwidth is added to this list to allow the scheduler to be
aware of network allocation at the hosts. This will support the ability
to avoid over-committing network resources at a host.

If you do a call() with e.g. the kombu driver, and there is no consumer
listening, then you will get a Timeout exception.

However, with the fake driver, we just silently return None in this
case. The oslo.messaging fake driver instead raises a Timeout and this
behaviour change turned up a tonne of issues with Nova's unit tests.

Make this change here too so that we can merge fixes for Nova's tests
before porting to oslo.messaging.

Note that although we also raise a Timeout in the case of cast(), but
cast() then just ignores the exception.

I'd add a test for this, but it appears we don't have any unit tests for
the fake driver.

Function _change_deleted_column_type_to_boolean_sqlite() from module
openstack.common.db.sqlalchemy.utils uses get_table() function to get
required Table object. Function get_table() creates a MetaData object and
returns the Table instance using this metadata. When function
`_change_deleted_column_type_to_boolean_sqlite` creates new table, it
also create new MetaData() objects.
It's works fine in most cases, but when table has foreign key, there is
no possibility to find related table for new table because related table
absent in new metadata.

To fix this issue we get metadata from received Table object.
Test added.

In review I5bf7795fca21627566ef4f688d45dc83bb953d1b (commit 3349417) we
passed an rpc_connection argument to pre_start_hook() so that we could
create additional queues.

See review Idf12c418a8ce1bc873e7ad6f702351e95d31aca3 for how this was
intended to be used. With oslo.messaging, we'd support doing something
like this by adding support for multiple targets to RPCServer since the
concept of a messaging connection isn't really exposed by the API in
quite the same way.

In any case, this rpc_connection parameter has never been used since it
was introduced, so let's remove it. Let's also move the invocation of
this hook back to where it originally was.

Cleaned up keystone.trust.controllers.TrustV3.delete_trust to use
the proper ""delete_tokens"" method from the token_api.

Added ""delete_trust"" reference method to keystone.trust.core.Driver.

Named-argument cleanup:

This patch removes some use of kwargs from manager calls where not
required. Dogpile.cache (the targeted caching library) does not
support kwargs out of the box with its cache-key-generator. This
change allows us to support the default cache-key-generator.

Cleanup done on a couple calls in keystone.assignment.core to remove
un-needed named-arguments.

Added a note on keystone.token.core.Driver indicating that
list_tokens should be considered a private method only used by
""delete_tokens"" and if treated as such, should not need caching.

In keystone.common.controller.V3Controller._get_domain_id_for_request
fixed named-argument call to token_api.get_token

In keystone.contrib.oauth1.controllers.OAuthControllerV3.authorize
fixed named-argument call to token_api.get_token

This was used for the ""whataremyips"" function. This function is now
implemented using a custom CFFI binding to the underlying POSIX APIs. This was
done for two reasons:

a) netifaces is not hosted on PyPi and requires scraping to find it, this
   presents both a reliability and security risk
b) netifaces doesn't work on PyPy since it is a CPython C-extension, the new
   cffi code works on both CPython and PyPy.

This code has only been tested on OS X thus far, but is based on some Twisted
code (licensed in a compatible fashion) which is said to work on any POSIX
platform. If a Windows implementation is needed, one can be written.

There are many test cases in tests/storage/base.py use same data
inserted into the database for tests, however, when multiple test
cases run at the same time, the data in the database are is
nondeterministic consider the setup and teardown get called many

Other fixes could be using the group_by clause from testr to group
not-process safe test cases together so that at least other test

From the point of view of the interface, a marker should has only
two states: returning some messages, or returning no messages.
Currently a malformed message marker results in a 400 response,
which makes the marker no longer opaque.

This patch makes the transport respond 204 for a malformed marker
by making storage return an empty iterator in such a case:

  GET /queues/q/messages?marker=malformed  ->  204

This patch also include some clean up on test code.

This reverts commit 062cc24f5dfc8e1652a589f6a2f45ce8f3a1b89c.

The apiclient is a very important idea.  However, that authentication
portion is highly likely to have security updates required in the
future, and having a copied section of code in multiple client
libraries will make patching difficult.

The implementation for this approach has been targetted for the
keystoneclient library, with the understanding that the keystoneclient
will then be used by the other clients to perform authentication.

The code as commited here has not yet been vetted in Keystoneclient.
There are some identified changes that will have to happen before it
is integrated there.  Thus, the version of code that is included in
this repository would have been incorrect very quickly.

The one change not removed with this revert is the addition of the
requests library to requirements.txt.  Removing that change now will
cause test failures elsewhere.

If ext-gw-mode extension isn't supported by plugin, it won't
return enable_snat param in router info. Agent will currently
default to enable_snat = false, which changes from expected
default behaviour prior to ext-gw-mode introduction.

This patch changes L3 agent to enable SNAT by default if plugin
doesn't support ext-gw-mode extension.

Python3 reorganized the standard library and moved several functions
to different modules. Six provides a consistent interface
to them through the fake six.moves module.

However, the urlparse, urllib2, etc modules have been combined
into one module which Six does not support so we do it via
py3kcompat.

Actually when you push samples into a pipeline, and the publishers don't
care of this sample, the publisher is called with a empty array of
samples.

This cause to send unuseful rpc/udp message.

With this change, the publisher is called only when it is needed.
