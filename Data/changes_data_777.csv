Reasons for the current (short) token lifespan:

- (Performance) A short token lifespan reduces the number of
  simultaneously-valid UUID, PKI, and PKIZ tokens in the database (or in
  memcached). This is not an issue for Fernet tokens, which are not
  persisted, anyway.

- (Security) We used to not be great about hiding bearer tokens from
  logs, HTTP requests, etc. We've gotten better, to say the least.

Problems with the current (short) token lifespan:

- (Use case) They break long-running processes when the token expires
  before the process completes. Alternative solutions to addressing this
  use case without increasing the expiration are complicated.

- (Performance) Users have to re-authenticate more frequently.

Drawbacks to increasing the token lifespan:

- (Security) Increased exposure for compromised bearer tokens.

Upcoming changes will add new methods to the identity drivers, so
in preparation for that we create a new versioned driver.

In order to allow the use of a legacy driver, one of the unit tests
had to be changed. Further, in order to maintain distinct models
for Identity, the copy of the sql driver for legacy testing required
all the classes/tables names to be given the V8 suffix.

Limitations:

The Shadow user driver interface loads and makes calls to the base
identity drivers. Currently this cannot load the legacy version,
meaning that the federated shadow users driver methods are not
tested against the legacy driver.

It has been renamed to parse_image_tag() as its in common location
and not specific to docker only

2. Allows image_pull() to take repo and tag as separate arguements.
This is done because in case if image driver is glance then it gives
an error when repo contains tag name

NOTE1: This patch does not validate repo names. Thats out of scope
of this patch and will be handled in separate patch

NOTE2: As of now metadata of glance driver is not stored anywhere so
glance driver takes tag as argument but do not really uses it

We were using parameters for scaling down but parameter_defaults for
scaling up. The old parameters from scale-down still persisted in the
stack and took precedence over the scaled-up parameter_defaults, so the
scaled-up values didn't propagate.

We already update parameter_defaults in the deployment plan in that same

Our current volume_update method reads the volume from the DB, joining
the volume table with 4 or 5 other tables, and then do the update using
SQLAlchemy ORM engine before returning updated ORM object.

But the truth is that we don't really need to retrieve the volume again
in any of existing cases, since the caller either doesn't care about
current value in the DB -for example when setting status to error- or it
already has that information -composing it with the current value it has
and the updated fields it's passing- and doesn't need to reload it.

This additional joined read from the DB on every volume update is
creating unnecessary load on the DB and reducing our network capacity
and in other resources we are not retrieving it either.

This patch modifies the way we do updates so we don't read current DB
values.

We are noticing several tests failing in our low memory environment
because of timeout in neutron requests.
As an example the test
tempest.api.compute.servers.test_server_actions.ServerActionsTestJSON
fails because it requests to plug a vif, and send request to neutron,
which responds in more than neutron_url_timeout, and since the option
vif_plugging_is_fatal is set to True as default, the test fails.
Shortly thereafter, checking in neutron log you can see the request,
returning with the proper status, after more than neutron_url_timeout,
however, it's already too late once nova already marked the instance
with error status, and so the test fails.

We were using parameters for scaling down but parameter_defaults for
scaling up. The old parameters from scale-down still persisted in the
stack and took precedence over the scaled-up parameter_defaults, so the
scaled-up values didn't propagate.

We already update parameter_defaults in the deployment plan in that same
method, so all we need to do is remove the 'parameters' part.

It also updates the OVS driver so that it only manages OVS-specific
resources and not the abstract plugin resources.

This allows Service Function Path IDs and identifiers to be managed and
generated in the networking-sfc plugin itself, instead of inside the
OVS driver, so that any driver can reuse these SFP allocations.

[WIP]
This is a work-in-progress and is missing the following at this time:
- Updated tests;
- A working Update Port Chain - the plugin/driver interface is not
  ideal to carry out the update of an existing port chain, due to the
  split into abstract plugin resources and specific [OVS] resources.
  As such, more discussion with the team should be held to decide the
  best way to approach this, potentially by modifying the plugin/driver
  interface;
- Hands-on validation of instantiating more than 1 port-chain;
- Potentially change migration path - and discuss implications
  of it since a lot of tables are being changed subtractively;
- Other planned code changes.

This job feels like an exception as no other neutron subproject has
veto over neutron patches. It was added to provide a weather bell
for potential breaking changes, but quite some time has gone since
then and we have become a lot better at spotting/dealing with bumps
in the road. It is only fair to treat lbaas as any other project and
take this job off the neutron queue.

the lack of public yum repos or rpms for those databases. Another

During post live migration the XML defined in libvirt does not contain
the definition of serial ports. That is because we call the method
get_guest_config_xml to retrieve the XML definition which is not going
to return a definition of serial ports because the instance already
define them. Actually calling this method to retrieve domain XML of an
instance is not good in every cases because the aim of that method is
to define a domain XML not to return a domain XML, for that purpose we
prefer to call XMLDesc(0).

Also that commit is removing the process to write into a file the
domain XML which is not used anymore. libvirtd is storing the XML
definition of domains by itself (see: guest.write_instance_config())

When performing an obj_clone on an Instance object, it relies on the
base obj_clone's deep copy method which just goes through all of the
fields and duplicates them on the clone.  However, the Instance object
has internal tracking attributes for metadata and system_metadata that
keep track of which keys have changed.  Since these don't get copied
over on the deep copy, these will show up as having changed on the
cloned Instance (if they had metadata set originally) and on a save
on this cloned object will end up updating the metadata in the db
which if these have stale information will wipe out other changes.

Such a scenario to this is occurring during build_instance where the
Claim constructor is saving off a clone of the Instance object
so that it will have the current copy.  In the case of a failure
during the build_instance, the claim will use this current copy
to then set the value of the host on the instance to None.  Since
the clone reflects that the system_metadata has changed, it will
as part of the save try to update the system_metadata in the db,
which since it is stale will wipe out changes made.

In the case of the issue being fixed here, the value in the
system_metdata being wiped out is the network_allocated=True
attribute.  By this being wiped out then reschedules of that
build_instance fail in cases where the IP address has been
assigned to the instance.

Specifying a PF passthrough device in the pci_passthrough_whitelist using its
fully qualified PCI address (no wildcard) causes the device to not be
properly loaded.  The PCI device is then not available to be assigned to any
guest.

In this case, the hypervisor reports the PF device without a 'parent_addr'.
But in the PciAddress, match() is using it when doing the comparison to its
own address.

This commit changes the logic of the address matching method in PciDevSpec to
only try to match the address with a physical function device when a
'parent_addr' is reported by the hypervisor.

silently ignoring rsync tempfiles, when running in debug we note the

I also consolidate our use of the regex for rsync tempfiles into the
diskfile module and move the negative test for the warning logger

This patch resolves a few issues I noticed when porting our
Neutron L3 service to support the new heat hiera agent hook (which
uses Json instead of Yaml).

 - If NeutronExternalNetworkBridge is an emptry string '' Json was
   dropping the single quotes thus causing the bridge to get set
   incorrectly in the config file. To correct this we use a heat
   conditional to avoid setting the external bridge (the '' default
   is what we want in this case) if the bridge is an empty string.

allow them to fail 5 checks before being removed, producing errors from

This is a hackish way to ensure that keepalived is restarted during the
next phase in order to have the ip recreated.

It basically adds a comment line to the keepalived.conf file (making it
different than the puppet one) if it's there. This will force a puppet
restart of the keepalive service puting the ips back on the undercloud.

clean steps methods, but they anyway won't be wired in due to a whitelist

The RAIDInterface contained a mistake: it didn't have an ABCMeta metaclass,

Allow cinder-volume, nova-compute and nova-libvirtd to be configured to
use NFS. In order to mount and work with NFS shares, several containers
needed the NFS packages installed during build time.

One somewhat significant change is the addition of an explicit bind
volume for nova-compute that has shared mounts enabled.

According to docker-run(1), the shared mount propagation flag can only
be specified for bind mounted Docker volumes and not named volumes.

In an NFS setup, cinder-volume mounts the NFS shares so that it can
create and manage the Cinder volumes. When a new instance is created
with a Cinder volume or a Cinder volume is attached to an existing
instance, nova-compute mounts the Cinder volume from the NFS share for
nova-libvirtd. In order for nova-libvirtd to then see those Cinder
volumes the shared mounts flag must be enabled for the Docker volume.

Remove the rpcbind container as it is only necessary for operators who
are using NFSv3 or lower. There is no known need for this currently
however, this container can be added in the future should an operator
require it.

Some functional tests fail because they assert dictionaries
with date/time items. For example, test_environment_template_create
checks that dictionary env_template exists in env_template_list
dicrionary list. All mentioned dictionaries have date/time items
with keys 'Created' and 'Updated'. If the system, where functional
tests are executed will be quite slow - time in these dictionaries
could differ. This behavior will result corresponding test to fail
even if all tasks will be executed successfully because time in
dictionaries for 'Created' and 'Updated' keys will differ and
assert will fail

Removing the date/time items from dictionaries will help to
successfully pass functional tests

Currently when we call the major-upgrade step we do the following:
""""""
...
if [[ -n $(is_bootstrap_node) ]]; then
    check_clean_cluster
fi
...
if [[ -n $(is_bootstrap_node) ]]; then
    migrate_full_to_ng_ha
fi
...
for service in $(services_to_migrate); do
    manage_systemd_service stop ""${service%%-clone}""
    ...
done
""""""

The problem with the above code is that it is open to the following race
condition:
1. Code gets run first on a non-bootstrap controller node so we start
stopping a bunch of services
2. Pacemaker notices will notice that services are down and will mark
the service as stopped
3. Code gets run on the bootstrap node (controller-0) and the
check_clean_cluster function will fail and exit
4. Eventually also the script on the non-bootstrap controller node will
timeout and exit because the cluster never shut down (it never actually
started the shutdown because we failed at 3)

Let's make sure we first only call the HA NG migration step as a
separate heat step. Only afterwards we start shutting down the systemd
services on all nodes.

We also need to move the STONITH_STATE variable into a file because it
is being used across two different scripts (1 and 2) and we need to
store that state.

Port security rules might contain rules that apply
to any protocol.

Currently there is no checking to see if a rule
which will be deleted belongs to a security
rule that applies to all protocols.

This patch addresses this issue by adding a check
to make sure the rule can be safely removed.

among containers with the same name by their IDs. The concept
is currently used in nova, i borrowed it from there after
finding the difficulty in using commands with ids.

When the CLI makes subsequent deployments it manually updates the plan
in Mistral. We need to do this for backwards compatibility as the deploy
command previously didn't have any plans or history behind it. So if a
user deploys with a specific parameter or template and then they remove
it in the next deploy it shouldn't still exist. In short, the CLI
expects everything to be passed to the deploy command every time.
Therefore, the easiest way to handle this is by manually resetting the
plan.

This has mostly been the case, but we neglected to reset the
parameter_defaults. Meaning, that a user may deploy with a parameter
like ""ComputeScale: 5"" and then deploy again, without defining it and it
would use the previous value when they would expect it to use the
default.

When selecting environments to deploy from the UI, every environment
filename gets added individually to 'environments' key in the Mistral
environment. Apparently it means we hit the Mistral execution size
limit pretty quickly.

This isn't needed for the CLI at this point because it bunches all the
environment files together into one big ""user-environments.yaml"" file,
for backwards-compabitility reasons.

Note that this Mistral value seems to affect both input and output for
task execution, which is why this patch was initially created as a
prerequisite for Ia9d2312e942229b659cfc65d4c370874e87f44da.

introduced a test,
test_update_port_status_notify_port_event_after_update, that is valid
only when l3 plugin support l3-ha. Such assumption isn't always true
depending on actual ml2 driver.
Since test cases in ml2.test_plugin is used as a common base for
multiple drivers,
test_update_port_status_notify_port_event_after_update, may or may not
pass. So split out tests with very specific assumption into a new
dedicated testcase so that each driver can safely reuse tests in
tests/unit/plugin/ml2 based on their characteristics.

Calling threading.Event.wait() when using eventlet results in a busy
loop calling epoll_wait, because the Python 2.x
threading.Condition.wait() implementation busy-waits by calling
sleep() with very small values (0.0005..0.05s).  Because sleep() is
monkey-patched by eventlet, this results in many very short timers
being added to the eventlet hub, and forces eventlet to constantly
epoll_wait looking for new data unecessarily.

This utilizes a new Event from eventletutils which conditionalizes the
event primitive depending on whether or not eventlet is being used.
If it is, eventlet.event.Event is used instead of threading.Event.
The eventlet.event.Event implementation does not suffer from the same
busy-wait sleep problem.  If eventlet is not used, the previous
behavior is retained.

For Newton backport, this bundles the Event from eventletutils
directly in oslo.messaging under the _utils module.  It is taken from:

With current code, if first subnet of the network is an ipv6 subnet,
the metadata proxy will not be spawned. If user then adds ipv4 subnet
with dhcp enabled, the metadata proxy will still not be spawned. As a
result, the metadata service will not be available for the network.

This patch will kill/spawn metadata proxy,  when subnet add/delete.
So, even if the first subnet of the network is not an ipv4 subnet with
dhcp enabled, the metadata proxy can still be spawned if network has
subnets need metadata proxy.

is under flux as the RHEL 7 STIG is getting released.

This patch removes the fix/check sections in the hopes of linking to the
STIG Viewer website soon. It also adds a severity marker to each STIG
listing so that readers better understand each control.

The normal deploy flow uses a NetworkInfoAsyncWrapper for network
allocation, and because of that many places have to call that class's
wait method to make sure it has completed. During a reschedule where
the network was allocated by a previous build attempt, a NetworkInfo
instance is retrieved instead, which does not have a wait method. This
then results in an exception complaining the missing method when it is
called. This fix addresses that by adding a no-op wait method to the
NetworkInfo class. Alternatively could have used isinstance or hasattr
to avoid making wait calls on NetworkInfo, but that could be
problematic to maintain as more places need to make wait calls in the
future and may not know to make the isinstance/hasattr check.

This fixes a regression issue caused by
61fc1b9ee11e416aecbf3a29e1d150a53fc890e8 ,
which reverted the previous fix made under

This patch improves the behavior of the helper script, get_node_logs.sh,
when a target VM's ssh server is not unresponsive.

First, it prints a message to inform the user about the problem.

Second, it skips the code for splitting log files if an unresponsive ssh
server prevented the VM's log files from being retrieved.

If the ssh server is not responding (usually due to a problem with the
target VM's kernel), the scripts wait indefinitely.

This patch makes ssh time out if the connection fails despite an open
ssh port.

One way of testing the behavior of an unresponsive ssh server without
making the VM's kernel fail is to stop the ssh server and start ""netcat
-l 22"" instead. It will reply on port 22 but completely fail to negotiate
an ssh session.

This introduces scenario tests which depend on the branch that is
being tested. This was done because in the current setup, adding new
services to the scenarios will break tests in other branches, since
those won't have this new service available.

So the idea is that scenario templates and environments will have the
release prefixed to them, and master won't need a prefix. So, the
current setup for testing the master branch for a specific scenario
still consists of these two files:

* test-environments/scenario00${scenario_number}-multinode-pingtest.yaml
* templates/scenario00${scenario_number}-multinode.yaml

These will contain the latest services added, making it easier for
service creators to introduce new additions to our test-suite.

Whenever there's a new release coming, we will then ""freeze"" the
master files by prefixing them with the release name. For instance,
for ocata we will have to create these for each scenario:

* test-environments/ocata-scenario00${scenario_number}-multinode-pingtest.yaml
* templates/ocata-scenario00${scenario_number}-multinode.yaml

Since this is a newly introduced feature for CI, releases newton and
below will actually use the following:

* test-environments/newton-and-below-scenario00${scenario_number}-multinode-pingtest.yaml
* templates/newton-and-below-scenario00${scenario_number}-multinode.yaml

I3c13cb525da126e272789d0db6301f5e58c13b51

For everything else like designate/trove/ceph jobs that don't
specify if they use neutron or not, those will start using neutron
on master (Ocata) changes. Any fallout will have to be dealt with
individually.

Current isa-l has possibility to return corrupted decoded data or
corrupted reconstructed data on decode/reconstruct without error code.

That is from the specification of isa-l rs vandermond matrix discussed
at [1]. With many # of parities cases, we may hit the case above due to
failing to get the inverse matrix from the encode matrix.

The isa-l maintener gbtucker suggests a good way to detect the failing
inverse matrix, that we should handle the return value gf_invert_matrix.
If gf_invert_matrix returns not 0, we should stop to decode/reconstruct
and return failure return code to the caller immediately. Otherwise, the
caller regards the garbage data/fragment as correct one.

And this patch adds the specific test case we can hit the issue (it
happens not so general).

Currently when we call the major-upgrade step we do the following:
""""""
...
if [[ -n $(is_bootstrap_node) ]]; then
    check_clean_cluster
fi
...
if [[ -n $(is_bootstrap_node) ]]; then
    migrate_full_to_ng_ha
fi
...
for service in $(services_to_migrate); do
    manage_systemd_service stop ""${service%%-clone}""
    ...
done
""""""

The problem with the above code is that it is open to the following race
condition:
1. Code gets run first on a non-bootstrap controller node so we start
stopping a bunch of services
2. Pacemaker notices will notice that services are down and will mark
the service as stopped
3. Code gets run on the bootstrap node (controller-0) and the
check_clean_cluster function will fail and exit
4. Eventually also the script on the non-bootstrap controller node will
timeout and exit because the cluster never shut down (it never actually
started the shutdown because we failed at 3)

Let's make sure we first only call the HA NG migration step as a
separate heat step. Only afterwards we start shutting down the systemd
services on all nodes.

We also need to move the STONITH_STATE variable into a file because it
is being used across two different scripts (1 and 2) and we need to
store that state.

During the instance boot (spawn/run) process, neutron ports are
allocated for the instance if necessary. If the instance fails
to spawn (say as a result of a compute host failure), the default
behaviour is to reschedule the instance and leave its networking
resources in-tact for potential reuse on the rescheduled host.
All is good if the instance is successfully rescheduled, but if
the reschedule fails (say no more applicable hosts) the allocated
ports are left as-is and effectively orphaned.

This commit add code to clean up allocated network resources
when the reschedule fails.

are unnecessary though since nothing uses instance.info_cache or

A libvirt guest can output its console into a ""console.log"" file.
This change enhances the reading of this file in case there is log
rotation on this file. This will be the case in a following change
which make use of the ""virtlogd"" deamon of libvirt 1.3.0 and beyond.
If no log-rotation is used, the method will behave as before. This
change makes the later virtlogd change easier to review.

The implementation of bp/libvirt-virtlogd will make use of log-rotation.
This change extracts the reading of the ""console.log"" file into one
method which makes it easier for a following patch to read from multiple
rotated log files.
This change also adds a note to explain why virt_types other than
qemu/kvm depend on the flushing into a ""console.log"" file as this
is not immediately obvious and could be removed by mistake.

We've moved all roles/tasks to use ansible_host instead of
ansible_ssh_host, since this is the new approach for Ansible.

There were a few left-overs which this PR fixes:
* Documentation in sample swift-remote.yml file
* Print hosts (IP) for the inventory-manage.py script lib.
* galera-cluster-rolling-restart - this will default to ansible_ssh_host
if ansible_host is not specified, although it should be if the inventory
has run.
