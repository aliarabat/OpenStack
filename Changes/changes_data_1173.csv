An intermittent 404 would occur because of the way that
Tempest keystone v3 authprovider was resolving base URLs.
Barbican wasn't passing in a region code, and the tempest
v3 auth provider was picking the ""first"" entry in the
entrypoint list, which was often the Barbican admin URL
(port 9312).  Trying to use that port for normal Barbican
ReST calls resulted in the http 404.  This fix adds the
region to the devstack config and uses that on the filter
that Barbican gives to Tempest to find the correct
Barbican endpoint.

Migration scripts 037, 041, and 043 treat raw_template.template as if it
were a dict, but it's actually a string.  In those scripts, raw_template
is a RowProxy object, not a RawTemplate object (where
raw_template.template would, in fact, be a dict).  Furthermore, a
RowProxy object does not allow attributes to be set, yet that's exactly
what those migration scripts attempt to do.

Fetch a list of RawTemplates from the database instead of a ResultProxy
to ensure the migration scripts work properly.

This reverts commit a73c4eac9453f0ed09709962e486ef93a1f19922.

The REST API relies on neutron-specific policy checking logic that is
only available after the extensions are loaded and the
RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP is populated. This patch resets the policies
immediately after these steps are done. This ensures that in the event
the policies are prematurely loaded for any reason, the on-demand
loading of the policies will reload the policies and properly configure
the neutron specific checks on the next policy check.

The icehouse branch does not currently have support for using the conf.d

the configuration, except swift (which is not available in the icehouse
branch) into a monolothic user configuration file. This ensures
compatibility of the configuration process for all branches.
This patch also ensures that the plays executed are appropriate for the
branches - the icehouse branch has different names for some of the
plays.

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that
is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is
completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.
This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was
deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we
cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.
This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of
v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload
process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v1: 412 Precondition Failed
v2: 410 Gone

nova-api still tries to start nova-api-metadata despite that being

The only place we ever update quotas as part of delete should
be when the instance DB record is removed. If something is
stuck in DELETING, it means that the quota was not updated.
We should make sure we're always updating the quota when
the instance DB record is removed.

Recently commit Ib6e0fc4e50c1ea144a9c538099e23597d66b429b
had made an explicit python version check for vnc function. This will
break the novnc functions for python under 2.7.4.

There are two problems for it:
1) The self.path argument will always be a relative path from the python
http basic module. If novnc, it will be 'websockify'. Hence, parse.scheme
will be always being empty.
2) Using python version to determine function compatible seems not to be
very appropariate. For example, Redhat 6.5 will ship with python2.6.6
but it already patched with urllibparse fix.

We should remove the version check for this part.

collected before its put into the network_cache.

track volume size internally, but the VDI of the attached volume matches

This patch adds an assertion at the end of spawn that checks whether

If not (eg, because it was deleted), then the ironic virt driver will
raise InstanceNotFound.

Current implementation of live migration in libvirt incorrectly includes
block devices on shared storage (e.g., NFS) when computing destination
storage requirements. Since these volumes are already on shared storage
they do not need to be migrated. As a result, migration fails if the
amount of free space on the shared drive is less than the size of the
volume to be migrated. The problem is addressed by adding a
block_device_info parameter to check_can_live_migrate_source() to allow
volumes to be filtered correctly when computing migration space
requirements.

This only fixes the issue on libvirt: it is unclear whether other
implementations suffer from the same issue.

Thanks to Florent Flament for spotting and fixing an issue while trying out
this patch.

Due to an assumption that libvirt live migrations work only when both
instance path and disk data is shared between source and destination
hosts (e.g. libvirt instances directory is on NFS), instance disks are
removed from shared storage when instance path is not shared (e.g. Ceph
RBD backend is enabled).

Distinguish cases that require shared instance drive and shared libvirt
instance directory. Reflect the fact that RBD backed instances have
shared instance drive (and no shared libvirt instance directory) in the
relevant conditionals.

UpgradeImpact: Live migrations from or to a compute host running a
version of Nova pre-dating this commit are disabled in order to
eliminate possibility of data loss. Upgrade Nova on both the source and
the target node before attempting a live migration.

problem, if we need more instances and want the instance names start

So a new template is introduced to solve the issue: '%(name)s-%(index)s'

- Refactor the main driver class, GlusterFSShareDriver, to make it
  pluggable with different NAS helpers.

   - Add GlusterNFS helper class to manage shares served by Gluster-NFS
     server. The management of these share was earlier done within the
     main driver class.

- Enhance the methods of the GlusterAddress class that would be used
  by the main driver class and the helper classes. Rename the
  GlusterAddress class to GlusterManager class. This class would
  contain the methods to interface with the backend GlusterFS volumes.

   - Retire GlusterAddress.make_gluster_args() in favor of
     GlusterManager.make_gluster_call(). The make_gluster_call() method
     implements a more correct approach to remote execution. It's
     remote execution is based on processutils.ssh_execute. The
     make_gluster_args() method that it replaces facilitated remote
     execution by prefixing arguments with 'ssh'.

   - Move the interface used to fetch the value of an option set on a
     GlusterFS volume, from the main driver class to the GlusterManager
     class.

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that
is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is
completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.
This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was
deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we
cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.
This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of
v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload
process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v1: 412 Precondition Failed
v2: 410 Gone

keepalived invokes the Neutron notifier scripts when state change
occur. However, when keepalived invokes two consecutive state changes
for the same router, the scripts may execute commands out of order.
For example, keepalived changes the state of an HA router from
fail to master to standby. It invokes notify_master,
then notify_standby.

However, from that point, we have no guarantee of ordering.
When the bug manifests, notify_standby writes 'standby' to the
HA state file, followed by notify_master; Meaning, the order
of notify script execution does not match the order of state
file writing.

The solution is to use flock when executing the scripts.
Note that I tried calling flock from inside the scripts in their
current form (Bash), as well as in a modified Python script,
but then you have no guarantee that the scripts will grab the lock
in the order in which they were executed. Thus the only option
is to use flock when executing the script itself.

In order to call the script through flock without -o,
we must remove any forking in the script itself. This change
moves the metadata proxy managemt from the notifier scripts
back to the agent. This means that the metadata proxy
will be spawned on the standby nodes as well.

I'm open to any alternatives.

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that
is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is
completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.

This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was
deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we
cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.

This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of
v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload
process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v1: 412 Precondition Failed
v2: 410 Gone

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that
is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is
completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.

This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was
deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we
cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.

This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of
v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload
process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v1: 412 Precondition Failed
v2: 410 Gone

Currently, a ThreadPool acquires resources that last until process
exit. You can let the ThreadPool go out of scope, but that doesn't
terminate the worker threads or close file descriptors or anything.

This commit makes it so you can .terminate() a ThreadPool object and
get its resources back. Also, after you call .terminate(), trying to
use the ThreadPool raises an exception so you know you've goofed.

I have some internal code that could really use this, plus it makes
the unit test run not leak resources, which is nice.

Current behavior:
* If data/body is present in manifest file PUT request, the data/body gets
  saved onto disk, just like for a normal object.
* Generally, this data in manifest file is never served on a GET response.
  However, when the manifest object path itself is part of prefix, GET
  response would contain data present in manifest file as well.
* The query param multipart-manifest=get meant to retrieve SLO manifest
  also works in case of DLO manifest. Hence a COPY request with the
  multipart-manifest=get query param would actually copy DLO manifest.

How things should have been:
* The DLO manifest object is supposed to have no content and only have
  X-Object-Manifest metadata header.
* Query param multipart-manifest=get is SLO specific and shouldn't have
  any role in DLO.

This change intends to only document current behaviour and not change it,
assuming there are users who have previously saved some content in DLO
manifest file and/or have been using multipart-manifest=get to fetch
and/or COPY the DLO manifest file with it's content.

Instead of using the expiring cache type as a means
to store worker information just avoid using that type
since we don't support expiry in the first place on
worker information and use a worker container and a
worker object that we can later extend as needed.

Also add on clear methods to the cache type that will be
used when the WBE executor stop occurs. This ensures we
clear out the worker information and any unfinished
requests.

This patch will add support for mapping client sort keys (eg, 'name')

This patch adds the unit test for get_project_quotas() when the
argument 'remains' is true. In this case, remains of each resource are
calculated.

'Remains' means the amount of a project quota which is not allocated to
users. The added test mocks quota_get_all(), which gets user quota if
explicitly set. 'Remains' of instances and cores are calculated by
subtracting 'hard_limit' returned by fake_quota_get_all() from 'limit',
which means project quota.

everyone is on the new client by the time Barbican is promoted.

Allow Resource objects to be built from either an existing object, or be
created from scratch with the given id. This is useful at the Proxy
level when creating interfaces that must work with a Resource in the
end, but will want to be able to either operate on string names or the
Resources returned from other APIs.

An example is that you may want to create an object in the object store
given a previously obtained container object and a string name for the
object. You may also have constructed the Resource for the object ahead
of time and may want to pass that instead of a string name.

Since the load_body function was not being used to parse the request
initially for orders, it was resulting in the exception that is seen
in the bug description. So, load_body was introduced. But, since
load_body uses a ""read"" for the ByteIO stream that contains the
request's payload, it could only be used once. So a ""seek(0)"" was
introduced to address this.

Currently the order of VIPs in keepalived.conf is determined
by sorting the VIPs whenever one is added or removed. As it
turns out, keepalived doesn't like it when the primary VIP
changes. One side effect is that virtual routes, in our case
the router's default route, may be removed.

This patch fabricates an IP address on the router's HA interface
and uses it as the primary VIP.

Commit 894f20d9cf57b36ccf9a675c6b2b070d56c9b297 changed the way that
enable_lazy() is being configured in cinder's test cases.  The changes
were required to remove the use of _lazy from the oslo's i18n library.
_lazy was removed from i18n and the code that was accessing the internal
variable broke.  The commit referenced above made changes to remove
the use of _lazy.

The commit, however, changed the behavior of the test cases to only
enable_lazy without disabling it, which diverges from the original
behavior.

This commit uses the new oslo.i18n ToggleLazy fixture (added in 1.3.0).

Here are the steps to reproduce:
1. Create a postgresql instance:

trove create postgresql_instance 100 --datastore postgresql
--datastore_version 9.3 --size 1 --databases db1 --users user1:password1

2. Verify it is ACTIVE:

trove list

3. Create a backup of this new instance:

trove backup-create <id> postgresql_instance-backup
--description postgresql_instance-description

4. Verify backup is complete:

trove backup-list

5. Create a new instance, using this backup instance:

trove create postgresql_instance-restored 100 --datastore postgresql
--datastore_version 9.3 --size 1 --backup <backup_id>

Here are the problems:
1. postgresql doesn't migrate the data, when backup_info is passed in.
2. postgresql outputs few benign messages into the stderr stream
during a normal restore procedure.

Here is the solution:
1. make sure that the postgresql manager always migrates the data by
not skipping the that step when recreating an instance from
backup in 'guestagent/datastore/postgresql/manager.py'.
2. watch for the expected error messages in the stderr stream
and avoid raising an exception in response.
Message 'ERROR:  role ""postgres"" already exists'
is expected and does not pose any problems to the restore operation.
We override the default error handling behavior
in 'guestagent/strategies/restore/postgresql_impl.py'.

UPDATES:
- Applied suggested style improvements.
- Use message whitelist rather than sequence.
- Match messages by regex.

This change is part of a multi-part change set to handle obsolete and
graduated oslo modules. This commit cleans up openstack-common.conf
which has unnecessary entries for middleware and fileutils that are
not required in trove.

Also, trove acquired a trove/openstack/common/utils.py which had two
routines that were long ago moved into strutils (now oslo.utils). The
sole remaining reference to that source file has been updated to
reflect this.

This change is based on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/141081/

Get_user_quota() has a side effect to the argument 'user_quota'. When
getting a settable quota range for a user, this method is called by
get_settable_quotas(). Get_settable_quota() does not expect that the
project quota is set when the user quota is not set. The side effect
makes the settable maximum value incorrectly great.

In this patch, to avoid this side effect and an extra DB access,
get_user_quota() copies the 'user_quota'.

To the unit test, the patch adds the case when the project quota for
floating_ip resource is set. The test mocks _process_quotas() instead
of get_user_quotas() to check the side effect of get_user_quotas().

Using the flavor extra_specs property ""hw_watchdog_action"" was broken.
Scheduling of a new instance always failed with NoValidHostFound error

host capability to be checked.

Commit f0ff4d51057080e769407e873e5ed212f15b773d caused the problem.

To fix this watchdog_action property is put into 'hw:' scope, so
that it will be ignored by ComputeCapabilitiesFilter in scheduler and
handled in libvirt driver. The doc must be fixed accordingly.

Now driver accepts both 'hw_watchdog_action' and
'hw:watchdog_action', tests were edited for these cases.

Port binding failure is an error and should be reported as such.
Additionally, if a port binding fails on a host due to missing
bridge mappings, it's currently quite a mystery to find out. This
should be logged instead of requiring users to debug code. Not
everyone enjoys debugging Python, as weird as that is!

I refactored out the common code in check_segment_for_agent
in order to make logging more robust for all agent-based mechanism
drivers. The OVS and LB mech drivers already log due to a bridge
mappings mismatch and the other agent based mech drivers
will now log as well.

catch metrics that were submitted correctly but took to long to be

Due to unclear meanings of existing names for share drivers modes it was
decided to replace string driver modes with boolean value, since we have only
two possible values that will clearly say what it used for by name of opt.

This replacement includes following changes:
- String opt 'share_driver_mode' is replaced with
bool opt 'driver_handles_share_servers'. New bool opt does not have
default value and should be defined explicitly.
- Class ShareDriver (parent class for share drivers) now expects additional
argument 'driver_handles_share_servers' which is mandatory and should be
provided by child classes. Expected values are boolean or tuple/list/set of
booleans that says what modes are supported. Above new config opt will be
compared to these.
- Update interfaces 'setup_server' and 'teardown_server' of class ShareDriver.
These interfaces now consider driver modes and call new additional private
methods only when driver is enabled to mode with share servers handling.
These new private methods are '_setup_server' and '_teardown_server', they
should be redefined by child classes when share servers should be handled by
Manila.
- To get know current driver mode within child classes just call property
'driver_handles_share_servers'. It can not be changed by child classes and
returns value that is set by config opt with same name.
- Remove methods 'setup_server' and 'teardown_server' from all share drivers,
that do not support handling of share servers.
- Rename methods 'setup_server' and 'teardown_server' to appropriate
private methods for drivers that do support handling of share servers.
- Update unit tests related to all changed places.
- Make Devstack set new mandatory bool opt.

Cells prepend full cell path to the service ID before returning any
service related info. This means service ID is non numeric and can't
be cast into Service objects.  In cells, service_get_all method
in HostAPI (which is used to display list of services) strips out
the cell path from received IDs, creates Service objects using
remaining numerical ID and uses a ServiceProxy to associate cell paths
Service objects.
However, other service related methods do not do so. They include:
 - service_update (Used for enabling/disabling services)
 - service_get_all_by_host (Used for evacuation)
These functions try to cast received service info (with alphanumeric
service IDs) into Service objects and fail with a ValueError.
This leads to API cell throwing Error 500 for service-enable,
service-disable and evacuate.
This patch extends the ServiceProxy usage to both these methods. It
also changes the corresponding HostAPI tests.

Note: The required unit-tests are manually added to the below path,
as new path for unit-tests is not present in stable/juno release.

Moved notification methods from notification_processor to new types directory.

types/interface.py now automatically records statsd information for configured

Configuration for a type is now optional.  Uncofigured types are not able to
send notifications.  Notifications that come across for unconfigured types
generate a warning.

Report utility rewritten from scratch.

To publish data from one build use:

  ./report.py -j <job_name> -N <build_number>

To publish data from all jobs in a view:

  ./report.py --view <view>

Improvements:

- do not update data if it is already present in spreadsheet;
- use records, not columns, therefore do not reconfigure the whole table for every change;
- retry if failed (for views);
- add debug output;
- support changes in test groups set: if we add new test case, column
  will be added; if we remove test case, its column will be empty;
- support builds with no test results.

Fuelmenu has a save-only mode which writes out an astute.yaml

When running a scenario that does not involve booting from volume, it is
important to avoid mapping the volume to be attached to the boot device.
vda is often a boot device. This uses vdrally which should never be
picked up as a boot device.

There may be a better way to do this by converting from
block_device_mapping to block_device_mapping_v2, where it is possible to
express a boot_index, but that's a more invasive change.

In Icehouse with ""iscsi_use_multipath=true"", detaching a multipath
iSCSI volume kills all iSCSI volumes visible from the nova compute node.
When we use different targets(IQNs) associated with same portal for
each different multipath device, all of the targets will be deleted
via disconnect_volume().

This patch fixes the behavior of detaching volume:

  1. Extract the targets for the detached multipath device.
  2. Delete/disconnect the targets for the detached multipath device.
