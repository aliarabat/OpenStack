The voluptuous library *can* be nicer to interact with and
is slightly more powerful (and pythonic) than the json-schema
library for data-validation.

It would be great to have it available for applications and
libraries in openstack to use for there validation of data
or other inputs/outputs (if they so choose to use it over
json-schema).

The current version in ubuntu trusty is 0.8.2, while fedora
seems to have access to 0.8.5 (so thats why the lower bound
is being set at 0.8.2 in this change).

In order to keep the support for `--ssl-nocompression` it was decided to
overwrite the https HTTPAdapter in `requests` poolmanager. Although this
seemed to work correctly, it was causing some issues when using
glanceclient from other services that rely on requests and that were
also configured to use TLS.

THis patch changes implements a different strategy by using
`glance+https` as the scheme to use when `no-compression` is requested.

second and we are expection > 20k metrics per second, this did not use
the kafka partitions well. The new code uses the timestamp plus
the count of metrics seen so far as the key. Performance tests

Simply replacing a failed disk requires a very long time if the ring is not
changed, because all data will be replicated to a single new disk. This extends
the time to recover from missing replicas, and becomes even more important with
bigger disks.

This patch updates the doc to include a faster alternative by setting the weight
of a failed disk to 0.  In this case the partitions from the failed disk are
distributed and replicated to the remaining disks in the cluster, and because
each disk gets only a fraction of the partitions it's also much faster.

Unfortunately it seems we have some very poorly
written keymgr unit tests, specifically
keymgr/test_barbican.py does this:
from barbicanclient.common import auth

First problem is that from a unit test perspective
that pretty much sucks, second problem is that
barbicanclient as of version 3.0.0.0 no longer
has an ""auth"" module, as a result Cinderunit tests
now fail.

The test_barbican.py unit tests need to be rewritten
to mock out the client components and actually test
Cinder components where needed without relying on
the barbicanclient.

For now in order to free up the gate, remove test_barbican.py

There are several locations where some unit test mixins are
incorrectly used multiple times with an otherwise same configuration,
which results in pointless re-runs of the same unit test. Similarily,
there are a few tests defined in classes inherited by multiple tests
that don't change behavior in the child tests so they are run multiple
times as well.

This patch eliminates the duplicates and moves some test cases from
their parent class into a subclass when they don't need to be run multiple
times. The result is 221 fewer test runs (~1.5% of the tests run).

If you try an unauthorized upload into a container that is over quota you get
a 403 instead of a 413, but if you try to unauthorized upload when an
*account* is over quota you can see the 413 even though the upload would have
been rejected by the authorize callback.  By wrapping the authorize callback
associated with the incoming request we can make sure to only return our 413
when the request would have been authorized otherwise.

Drive by doc fixes thanks to acoles:

 * State that container_quotas should be after auth middleware in
   the class doc string.
 * Add note to proxy-server.conf.sample that account_quotas should
   be after auth middleware.

The equivalent statements are already in place for each quota
middleware.

Fixes are proposed for ordering alarms based
on ""timestamp"" in descending order.
Existing tests has been modified at storage
and api without breaking their functionality.

One test case has been provided with this patch.

Add ordering for returned alarms in impl_hbase

Added descending timestamp ordering for alarms are returned by
""get_alarms"" in ""impl_hbase"" module. Used builtin ""sorted""
function, because HBase doesn't have any possibilities for
custom ordering.

When using Sahara with use_floating_ips=false, instances are accessed
through a proxy (both for SSH and HTTP connections). Currently Sahara
reaches them using a hard-coded proxy command. This patch makes this
command user-definable in the configuration file.

Changes:
- Move HTTP adapters logic out of Neutron-related code.
- Transform the neutron proxy command into a generic one:
    'ip netns exec qrouter-{router_id} nc {host} {port}'
- Use user-defined proxy command when proxy_command is set in conf;
  the hard-coded proxy command when use_floating_ips=false and
  use_namespaces=true; otherwise no proxy.
- Add tests for those three possibilities + misconfiguration.

Examples of use:
- proxy_command='ip netns exec ns_for_{network_id} nc {host} {port}'
- proxy_command='ssh proxy-machine-{tenant_id} nc {host} {port}'

Unfortunately it seems we have some very poorly
written keymgr unit tests, specifically
keymgr/test_barbican.py does this:
from barbicanclient.common import auth

First problem is that from a unit test perspective
that pretty much sucks, second problem is that
barbicanclient as of version 3.0.0.0 no longer
has an ""auth"" module, as a result Cinderunit tests
now fail.

The test_barbican.py unit tests need to be rewritten
to mock out the client components and actually test
Cinder components where needed without relying on
the barbicanclient.

For now in order to free up the gate, remove test_barbican.py

Note: This change is a continuation of a previous change
that was abandoned due to rebase issues (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/63510)

Adding new ssl extension for ssl-termination support
in neutron.
Extension is served by lbaas plugin
and is extending lbaas vip with ssl entities associations
For this to work, I changed the new resource_helper module
to get attributes from the attributes module where it's actually
updated by the attributes extension mechanism

Creating new abstract driver for ssl api
Adding new absract driver as a base to radware driver

Adding ssl dbmixin for ssl policies and certificates
management.
If service provider (driver) is not inheriting from new
abstract ssl driver - new ""ExtensionNotSupportedByProvider""
exception is raised.

Since association of ssl certificates and vip requires
sending a list on certificates, list support was needed
in neutron resource attributes parsing mechanism.
I added the lists support and extended unit tests to test it.

Added unit tests for extension and db mixin

Alembic migration was added for the change

Radware driver and its unit tests are WIP, do not review.

This commit changes the CLI tests to use the auth providers for
credentials. Previously they were just using the admin credentials
straight from the config file. The typical motivation for doing this
would be tenant isolation for running in parallel, but that doesn't
apply to the CLI tests because they are simple read-only. However, in
the future when test-accounts supports admin credentials doing this
won't be supported.

Cinder volume can only be managed by a cinder-volume process that has <host>
configuration variable value matching <os-vol-host-attr:host> attribute of the
volume.

By default, host of a cinder-volume service is set to its hostname, which means
that if one controller is lost, none of its volumes can be managed by
cinder-volume processes on other controllers. This makes sense for Cinder LVM,
but not for RBD or other shared backends.

This commit sets <host> to the same value on all controllers when RBD backend
is enabled, so that any controller can manage RBD backed volumes created by any
other controller.

management network shoule be used. Default management network is ipv4.

Note that there is a bug in eventlet that prevents the use of literal IPv6
addresses in URL. The fix to it hasn't been released. Therefore, it's
recommended that HOST_IP and SERVICE_HOST be explicitly defined with HOSTNAMES.

when literal IPv6 addresses are supported, make sure that HOST_IP and
SERVICE_HOST are using literal IPv6 address format when defining them in your
localrc. That is, quote the IPv6 address with '[' and ']'.

Also in your localrc, make sure to disable n-api-meta. There is a bug there
that prevents nova api from being started successfully.

Avoid using lua locks

The default redis library will try to be smart about using
or not using lua based locks, it seems to not correctly predict
this correctly and then fails with errors such as:

''unknown command 'EVALSHA''

Upstream issue filed:

https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/issues/550

The 'traditional' locks require PEXPIRE used by the redis-py
library which requires redis 2.6+ to actually work. So when
we are using a server version that is not new enough
we should conditionally raise a not implemented error to
avoid it later failing (which it will).

This also fixes a bunch of encoding issues that the enabling
of the py33 system now exposed (damn encodings...)

During prework of scheduler split, we identified that
there is a call from setup_instance_group to the Nova object

separate project because it would have an external dependency to

The implementation here is providing the call by the conductor

modifies filter_properties for adding group details.

As long as python-barbicanclient maintainers don't provide a patch
for 3.0.0 (which seems not happen FMPOV), we need to disbable this
version.

When https://review.openstack.org/#/c/125231/ was merged, the glance
providers became dependent on the DEFAULT/os_region_name parameter in
the glance configs, but the module had no way to set that parameter.
This caused the providers to fail.

This patch adds the parameter to glance::api so that the user can
control the value. It also removes functionality of the os_region_name
in glance::backend::cinder. While it would be better to deprecate this
parameter first and remove its functionality in a later release, there
is no clean way to do this and avoid a duplicate definition error.

An alternative to rapidly removing this functionality from
glance::backend::cinder would be modifying the glance parent provider
to make the DEFAULT/os_region_name glance config optional.

There is a race condition during finish_resize() where
poll_unconfirmed_resizes() can get called between the database save
of the migration record and instance record. The migration record
will be marked 'finished', enabling poll_unconfirmed_resizes() to pick
it up. But the instance will not have been saved yet to have the
vm_state of RESIZED, and task_state of None. The task_state will
still be RESIZE_FINISH. This will cause poll_unconfirmed_resizes() to
put the migration record in error state.

Instead, poll_unconfirmed_resizes() should ignore instances with
a task state of RESIZE_FINISH and not put the migration record
into error state.

It is also necessary for each interface to know the route to the other

If we're doing a lot of build operations, we are using a large portion
of the limited rpc worker pool for long periods of time. Since we may wait
on external services (like neutron or glance) during those times, we could
fully deplete that pool.

This patch makes us spawn a new greenthread for that task and return the
rpc worker to the pool. Due to some funkiness with the stack of decorators,
this breaks the inner function out to an object method, which is probably
good anyway, given its size. This also moves the wrap_instance_event
decorator to the inner function so that the start and stop events properly
demarcate the actual task and not just the (now very quick) RPC call.

was not always enough time and produced failures in Jenkins.

This change uses the 'retrying' package to wait until

much less than a second, thereby signficantly reducing

At startup, Glance first creates the stores and then verifies
the default store. Each of these operations will indirectly
trigger the creation of store objects which is triggering configure
and configure_add calls.
configure and configure_add can potentially contain remote calls
going through the network: we should avoid having these methods
called two times for nothing.

This patch adds a parameter in the store init method to specify
if the configuration of the store should happen. In case of verify
default store, the configuration should not happen.

removed. The remaining function, _cache_sparse_image() no longer

If you don't have (or provide) the wrong image, KeyName,
or flavor, we fail at some later point (not always early,
depending on what's wrong).

Since Icehouse, Heat has had a ""custom constraints"" method
of dynamically validating parameter values, by comparing the
value provided with a list from the underlying service.

Despite the name, there's nothing ""custom"" about the constraints,
these ones are included in Heat by default (though they are pluggable,
which is where the name comes from..)

See the docs for more info:
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/template_guide/hot_spec.html#custom-constraint

Note, I've not considered network validation here, this could
possibly be added in a subsequent patch.

These constraints are evaluated via any of the following:
- heat template-validate -f <template>
- heat stack-preview <arguments given to create>
- heat stack-create <arguments, fails fast before creating anything>
- heat stack-update <arguments, fails fast before updating anything>

The configuration option CONF.glance.glance_api_servers is meant to
be a list of Glance API servers, and should behave similar to its use
in Nova and Cinder: that each time a Glance API server is wanted, one
of the servers in the list is returned.

This changes CONF.glance.glance_api_servers to be a list instead of
a string. The list is randomly shuffled, and an iterator is
used to cycle through the list of servers.

This is backwards compatible and handles the case where the
user may have set [glance]/glance_api_servers = 'host:port' (or
'host1:port1, host2:port2'). The configuration library will
convert that to the corresponding list.

Once greenthread pool is full, it will block execution of new threads
until some of active threads complete their execution.

The default value (64) is too low for some types of load when threads
are I/O bound, waiting for an external entity to reply. One of examples
is Nova booting multiple instances in parallel, that results in lots of
requests to Neutron to bind ports for them. This process may take a
while, so in the meantime Nova is blocked to proceed with booting more
instances, and eventually some of boot requests fail due to timeout.

Increasing the size of a greenthread pool does not mean booking of any
system resources, so we're free to set any number without being afraid
of hitting some resource limit.

That said, high parallelism may have its drawbacks in some scenarios.
For example, if each thread opens a lot of file descriptors, and there
are lots of them executing in one single time, we can end up hitting
process limit on opened fds, which is 1024 by default on Linux. So
assuming each thread opens a pipe at the same time (which usually uses
three fds), we're safe to run 1024/3 ~ 341 threads without hitting the
limit.

The change conservatively raises the size of the pool to 256 which
should be enough for loads we currently envision. We may return back to
the value if we hit the next limit.

Currentry, object-replicator might not sync its own replica
even if it is different from other primary node's one.
That is because object-replicator and object-server never recalculate
their own local suffix hashes when the local suffixes are in hash.pickles.

This causes to keep inconsistency forever unfortunately among primary replicas
when a PUT request succeeded with quoram successes.

This is the unfortunate case here:

Assuming 3 replica

T0: An object created by a PUT request.
    (all of replicas succeeded)
T1: A hash.pickle created by object-replicator.
T2: The object updated by a PUT request.
    (2 replicas succeeded but 1 replica failed by some reason)
T3: Exisiting hash.pickle was used by object-replictor to check the object existence.
    (Exisiting suffix hashes in hash.pickle are never recalculated)
T4: An object-replicator passes WITHOUT pushing its own local replica to the failure replica.
...
Tn: Each replica never gets its consistency among primary nodes.

This patch fixes object-replicator to recalculate its local
suffix hashes eventually.

The force_raw_image comes from nova side as a
fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1383465.

The reason of the flag is, after all images are forced
to be raw because of security reason
(https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/853330), this flag
is added later so that deployer can still select using raw images or
compressed images.

Currently this flag is used in the deeper of functions like image_to_raw() or
converted_size(). For example, image_to_raw() will convert the image
to be raw format only if the force_raw_image flag is set, that means
the caller totally have no idea if the image returned is a raw image or not.

This is possibly ok for libvirt since libvirt does not care for qcow2
or raw, but it's different for ironic, since we will take different action
for qcow2/raw format. A flag in such deeper layer is not so good.

This patch changes these functions, so that the caller in image cache level
accept parameter from deploy level like iscsi_deploy or pxe, which make
decision based on the config.

Prior to this change, the keepalived element only allowed for a single
keepalive interface. This could be problematic if, for instance,
keepalive is managing several VIPs which are on different broadcast
domains - for instance, because one vip is on an interface/vlan that's
accessible to the public, while another is on an interface/vlan that's
only accessible within the cloud.

This change allows for a more flexible configuration in which multiple
vrrp instances can be defined in heat- each with their own interface,
router_id, and set of virtual IPs.

This patchset partially completes a spec which will one day live at
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo/+specs/tripleo-juno-virtual-public-ips
but for now can bee seen in  Id9addc65f0d2ed519ce4b3edbd561ed660a2786e

Removed the check weight configuration as vrrp_sync_groups and and
check_script weights are mutually exclusive configurations. Regardless,
based on
https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/blob/master/doc/keepalived.conf.SYNOPSIS#L103
the default weight is automatically set to 2 if not specified.

This patch addresses several problems with the current implementation.

1. Appending a record to EMS should not in itself trigger ASUP
delivery. These should be separately scheduled and Openstack cinder
should have no role in ASUP scheduling or delivery, only a role in
logging via EMS.

2. Log frequency should be adjusted from weekly to hourly.

3. The log message should be useful for support. It should include
release (Havana, Icehouse, Juno, etc.) version (2014.1.1), and
distribution information (RHEL-OSP, etc.) rather than simply noting that
the message came from ""Openstack.""

Previously, the API would always report empty tables for
any datasource table queried through policy.  For example,
asking for all rows of the 'neutron:ports' table occurring in
the policy 'classification' would always return the empty set.

This change fixes the behavior to ensure the proper rows
are returned.  There was a typo in the get_arity function

name 'neutron:ports' instead of just the table name 'ports'.

If you try an unauthorized upload into a container that is over quota you get
a 403 instead of a 413, but if you try to unauthorized upload when an
*account* is over quota you can see the 413 even though the upload would have
been rejected by the authorize callback.  By wrapping the authorize callback
associated with the incoming request we can make sure to only return our 413
when the request would have been authorized otherwise.

Drive by doc fixes thanks to acoles:

 * State that container_quotas should be after auth middleware in
   the class doc string.
 * Add note to proxy-server.conf.sample that account_quotas should
   be after auth middleware.

The equivalent statements are already in place for each quota
middleware.

get_host_name_for_vm was extremely and unnecessarily inefficient. In
fetching a host, it:

1. Got the host_ref for the VM
2. Threw away the type component of the host_ref
3. Retrieved all HostSystem objects known to vSphere
4. Searched them for the object matching the value component of the
   host_ref
5. Retrieved the name property from the returned component

The new implementation does:

1. Get the host_ref for the VM
2. Get the name property of the HostSystem object with that host_ref

Consequently, the following functions are no longer used, and go away:

* get_host_ref_from_id
* property_from_property_set
* get_host_id_from_vm_ref

get_host_ref_for_vm is modified in both its implementation (see
above), and to return the host_ref its name suggests rather than an
ObjectContent object.

If a glance image has a vmware_ostype property which doesn't
correspond to a valid VMware guestId, VM creation will fail with the
unhelpfully generic error message:

A specified parameter was not correct.

This change improves this situation slightly by logging a warning if
VM creation fails and guestId is not a recognised value. We limit
ourselves to logging a warning because we don't want to tightly couple
ourselves to the vSphere behaviour. We can't guarantee that this is
the reason the RPC call failed, or that it is the only reason the RPC
call failed.

DocImpact

This change doesn't impact the behaviour of the VMware driver except
that it will emit an additional warning message to the logs under the
circumstances described. However, given the potential for
user misconfiguration, we should describe this pitfall in the docs.

specify disable_process_locking and lock_path in the CONF

flags.

The previous attempt at updating nova to use oslo.concurrency
was reverted as it stopped running any tests. lockutils-wrapper
should have been used in ini/shell scripts
instead of lockutils.py module as the the module is
no longer runnable (__main__ has been removed).  In this
review we use lockutils-wrapper correctly. The test harness
has since been updated to bail out if 0 tests are run as
well for additional insurance.

When a floating ip is dissociated with a port, the current
connection with the floating ip is still working. This patch
will clear the connection state and cut off the connection
immediately.

Since conntrack -D will return 1, which is not an error code,
so add extra_ok_codes argument to execute methods.
