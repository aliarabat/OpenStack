Rerunning the overcloud deploy command with no changes restarts a
truckload of containers (first seen this via
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1612960).  So we really have
three separate issues here. Below is the list of all the containers that
may restart needlessly (at least what I have observed in my tests):
A) cron category:
ceilometer_agent_notification cinder_api cinder_api_cron cinder_scheduler
heat_api heat_api_cfn heat_api_cron heat_engine keystone keystone_cron
logrotate_crond nova_api nova_api_cron nova_conductor nova_consoleauth
nova_metadata nova_scheduler nova_vnc_proxy openstack-cinder-volume-docker-0
panko_api

These end up being restarted because in the config volume for the container there is
a cron file and cron files are generated with a timestamp inside:
$ cat /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/keystone/var/spool/cron/keystone
...
 # HEADER: This file was autogenerated at 2018-08-07 11:44:57 +0000 by puppet.
...

The timestamp is unfortunately hard coded into puppet in both the cron provider and the parsedfile
provider:
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/lib/puppet/provider/cron/crontab.rb#L127
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/lib/puppet/provider/parsedfile.rb#L104

We fix this by repiping tar into 'tar xO' and grepping away any line
that starts with # HEADER.

B) swift category:
swift_account_auditor swift_account_reaper swift_account_replicator
swift_account_server swift_container_auditor swift_container_replicator
swift_container_server swift_container_updater swift_object_auditor
swift_object_expirer swift_object_replicator swift_object_server
swift_object_updater swift_proxy swift_rsync

So the swift containers restart because when recalculating the md5 over the
/var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/swift folder we also include:
B.1) /etc/swift/backups/... which is a folder which over time collects backup of the ringfiles
B.2) /etc/swift/*.gz it seems that the *.gz files seem to change over time

We just add a parameter to the tar command to exclude those files as
we do not need to trigger a restart if those files change.
--exclude='*/etc/swift/backups/*' --exclude='*/etc/swift/*.gz'

C) libvirt category:
nova_compute nova_libvirt nova_migration_target nova_virtlogd

This one seems to be due to the fact that the /etc/libvirt/passwd.db file contains a timestamp and
even when we disable a user and passwd.db does not exist, it gets
created:

During image prepare, the intent of build_service_filter is to filter
out services which are *known* to be not containerized, either because
they are puppet services, or have been mapped to 'OS::Heat::None'.

However if a partial resource registry is passed in, then this was
also filtering out the services with missing resource_registry
mappings. Since we're now assuming services are containerized by
default, this behaviour was cause many of the issues with missing or
no image parameters being generated.

readthedocs project owners to add infra to their projects, so we can
not do the update on their behalf.  Not everyone reads the mailing

missed that the publishing isn't actually happening.

adds the extra info required to make the jobs work.

1. If the load balancer host is not the same as the control
   plane hosts, then 'Ensuring haproxy runs' fails unless
   facts are gathered.

2. The value for 'repo_release_path' is set in the vars file
   'defaults/source_install.yml', so the repo check fails
   without reference to that vars file.

3. When running 'Sanity checks for all containers' not all
   host and container facts are gathered, so the play fails
   due to missing facts unless facts are set to gather.

4. Instead of verifying both localhost and the utility
   containers for being ready to run the os_* modules, we
   only need to verify whichever one is the designated
   'openstack_service_setup_host'.

5. The memcache server connectivity test should have a short
   timeout, otherwise the task hangs for ages if it isn't
   working.

6. The rabbitmq vhost name is corrected and set consistently,
   otherwise those tests do not work.

7. The rabbitmq test venv fails to build for two reasons. One
   is that the venv creation fails, because virtualenv tries
   to download the latest pip/setuptools and fails due to the
   pip.conf restricting it. The second is that the python
   package 'pika' is not on the repo server. The task is changed
   to make use of the common python_venv_build role and to make
   use of pypi as an index when building the wheel.

because instead of duplicating the build processes in the
repo_build role and the service role - we only have it all
done in a single place.

We also change the role venv tag var to use the integrated

venv tag in group_vars in the integrated build. This reduces
memory consumption and also reduces the duplication.

This is by no means the final stop in the simplification

1. Replaces 'developer mode' with an equivalent mechanism

When a client sent ""X-Delete-After: <n>"", the proxy and all object
servers would each compute X-Delete-At as ""int(time.time() +
n)"". However, since they don't all compute it at exactly the same
time, the objects stored on disk can end up with differing values for
X-Delete-At, and in that case, the object-expirer queue has multiple
entries for the same object (one for each distinct X-Delete-At value).

This commit makes two changes, either one of which is sufficient to
fix the bug.

First, after computing X-Delete-At from X-Delete-After, X-Delete-After
is removed from the request's headers. Thus, the proxy computes
X-Delete-At, and the object servers don't, so there's only a single
value.

Second, computation of X-Delete-At now uses the request's X-Timestamp
instead of time.time(). In the proxy, these values are essentially the
same; the proxy is responsible for setting X-Timestamp. In the object
server, this ensures that all computed X-Delete-At values are
identical, even if the object servers' clocks are not, or if one
object server takes an extra second to respond to a PUT request.

With a small improvement on NeutronFixture that allows creating more
than two ports we can let our tests to exercise and therefore cover
most of the neutronv2/api code as well. To do that this path removes a
lot of fake_network.set_stub_network_methods() calls from the tests.
The remaining calls are not that trivial to remove so those are left in
for a later patch.

The numa functional tests uses the libvirt fixture and during the guest
config xml generation it tries to instantiate OVOs from os_vif. To make
this work the libvirt fixture has to make sure that the
os_vif.initialize() is called as that call registers the OVOs.

 Conflicts:
	nova/tests/fixtures.py
	nova/tests/functional/libvirt/test_numa_servers.py

NOTE(melwitt): The conflicts are from differences between the list_networks
and create_port methods in Rocky vs Queens, and changes to NUMA tests that
don't exist in Queens.

This adds a request filter that, if enabled, allows us to use placement
to select hosts in the desired availability zone by looking up the uuid
of the associated host aggregate and using that in our query for
allocation candidates. The deployer needs the same sort of mirrored
aggregate setup as the tenant filter, and documentation is added here to
make that clear.

- bump the starting point from stable/ocata (!) to stable/queens;

The create_incomplete_consumers online data migration was added in
Rocky via change Id609789ef6b4a4c745550cde80dd49cabe03869a. That
relies on hitting some tables in the API (or placement) database.
The DB API code for that migration relies on a placement context
manager which looks like it was regressed with change
I2fff528060ec52a4a2e26a6484bdf18359b95f77 (also in Rocky). This
results in a DB error trying to query the projects table but
because of a generic try/except in _run_migration, the failure
was missed in CI testing.

This adds the configuration of the global placement DB API context
manager so we can properly query the placement-related tables.

Rerunning the overcloud deploy command with no changes restarts a
truckload of containers (first seen this via
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1612960).  So we really have
three separate issues here. Below is the list of all the containers that
may restart needlessly (at least what I have observed in my tests):
A) cron category:
ceilometer_agent_notification cinder_api cinder_api_cron cinder_scheduler
heat_api heat_api_cfn heat_api_cron heat_engine keystone keystone_cron
logrotate_crond nova_api nova_api_cron nova_conductor nova_consoleauth
nova_metadata nova_scheduler nova_vnc_proxy openstack-cinder-volume-docker-0
panko_api

These end up being restarted because in the config volume for the container there is
a cron file and cron files are generated with a timestamp inside:
$ cat /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/keystone/var/spool/cron/keystone
...
 # HEADER: This file was autogenerated at 2018-08-07 11:44:57 +0000 by puppet.
...

The timestamp is unfortunately hard coded into puppet in both the cron provider and the parsedfile
provider:
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/lib/puppet/provider/cron/crontab.rb#L127
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/lib/puppet/provider/parsedfile.rb#L104

We fix this by repiping tar into 'tar xO' and grepping away any line
that starts with # HEADER.

B) swift category:
swift_account_auditor swift_account_reaper swift_account_replicator
swift_account_server swift_container_auditor swift_container_replicator
swift_container_server swift_container_updater swift_object_auditor
swift_object_expirer swift_object_replicator swift_object_server
swift_object_updater swift_proxy swift_rsync

So the swift containers restart because when recalculating the md5 over the
/var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/swift folder we also include:
B.1) /etc/swift/backups/... which is a folder which over time collects backup of the ringfiles
B.2) /etc/swift/*.gz it seems that the *.gz files seem to change over time

We just add a parameter to the tar command to exclude those files as
we do not need to trigger a restart if those files change.
--exclude='*/etc/swift/backups/*' --exclude='*/etc/swift/*.gz'

C) libvirt category:
nova_compute nova_libvirt nova_migration_target nova_virtlogd

This one seems to be due to the fact that the /etc/libvirt/passwd.db file contains a timestamp and
even when we disable a user and passwd.db does not exist, it gets
created:
[root@compute-1 nova_libvirt]# git diff cb2441bb1caf7572ccfd870561dcc29d7819ba04..0c7441f30926b111603ce4d4b60c6000fe49d290 .

passwd.db changes do not need to trigger a restart of the container se
we can safely exclude this file from any md5 calculation.

Part C) was: Co-Authored-By: Martin Schupper <mschuppe@redhat.com>

We only partial-bug this one because we want a cleaner fix where
exceptions to the files being checksummed will be specified in the tht
service files.

This patch is adding health checks for background processes. The check
is performed by comparing recon cache file modification. This is far
from ideal, because recon files are shared via services of same type.
But it's the only way to at least partialy check correct behaviour
for background processes. In future there we should add timestamp info
to each recon file for all services using the recon file. Then we would
be able to find out if all background services are updating their caches
in timely fashion and stay within the border of containers.

Unfortunately guestfish may error out silently (no return code

this we add a bunch of stdout output to the script, and look
for that final step to validate success. To make this work, we
need to copy the script over and execute it with the command

When a mock hasn't been provided with a long-enough list of side-effects
for the number of times it is called, it raises StopIteration (instead
of something sensible like AssertionError). Prior to Python 3.7, this
exception could bubble up until it just stopped a task. (In Python 3.7
it will eventually be caught and turned into a RuntimeError.)

To ensure that any errors of this sort are not handled silently, and to
enable us to test for them prior to using Python 3.7, catch any
StopIteration errors coming from plugin-provided non-generator functions
and convert them to RuntimeError exceptions.

This reveals many errors in the unit tests, many introduced in the
process of converting from mox to mock, which are also fixed by this
patch.

Right now, openSUSE and CentOS are missing ceph jobs because they
timeout. We can leverage the distribution installation method to
introduce new ceph jobs which are more likely to pass. However,
CentOS and Ubuntu are not working for this installation method so we
only add a job for openSUSE for the time being.

Developers run all sorts of different tools within Git repositories,
any of which can leave their own special trashfiles all over the
place. We can't every hope to catalog them all, so better to
recommend developers simply configure a global core.excludesfile to
filter the irrelevant files which tend to get created by their
personal choice of tools.

To this end, remove the long-standing sections for ""Mr Developer""
and ""Editors"" since their mere existence here sends the signal that
we welcome (and have time to review) additions for any old tool
someone ever might happen to try. Also add a comment block
explaining this, for clarity.

We can, and should of course, continue to list files created by the
tools recommended by our workflow (test frameworks called from tox,
documentation and packaging builds, et cetera).

When a mock hasn't been provided with a long-enough list of side-effects
for the number of times it is called, it raises StopIteration (instead
of something sensible like AssertionError). Prior to Python 3.7, this
exception could bubble up until it just stopped a task. (In Python 3.7
it will eventually be caught and turned into a RuntimeError.)

To ensure that any errors of this sort are not handled silently, and to
enable us to test for them prior to using Python 3.7, catch any
StopIteration errors coming from plugin-provided non-generator functions
and convert them to RuntimeError exceptions.

This reveals many errors in the unit tests, many introduced in the
process of converting from mox to mock, which are also fixed by this
patch.

directory to the base of the repo, and removes the unnecesary

The original change is done in a backward incompatible way.

As a first step, we need to provide deprecation messages (see novaclient
as an example[1]), check who can be affected (using codeseach for
example) and after several cycles - remove.

Affected by the original change:
- rally gates are broken (easy to fix, but anyway)
- openstackclient [2]

Also, it worce to mention that official API reference for V2 still
propose to use source_replica [3].

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements

In order to radically simplify how we prepare the service
venvs, we use a common role to do the wheel builds and the
venv preparation. This makes the process far simpler to
understand, because the role does its own building and
installing. It also reduces the code maintenance burden,
because instead of duplicating the build processes in the
repo_build role and the service role - we only have it all
done in a single place.

We also change the role venv tag var to use the integrated
build's common venv tag so that we can remove the role's
venv tag in group_vars in the integrated build. This reduces
memory consumption and also reduces the duplication.

This is by no means the final stop in the simplification
process, but it is a step forward. The will be work to follow
which:

1. Replaces 'developer mode' with an equivalent mechanism
   that uses the common role and is simpler to understand.
   We will also simplify the provisioning of pip install
   arguments when doing this.
2. Simplifies the installation of optional pip packages.
   Right now it's more complicated than it needs to be due
   to us needing to keep the py_pkgs plugin working in the
   integrated build.
3. Deduplicates the distro package installs. Right now the
   role installs the distro packages twice - just before
   building the venv, and during the python_venv_build role
   execution.

In order to radically simplify how we prepare the service
venvs, we use a common role to do the wheel builds and the
venv preparation. This makes the process far simpler to
understand, because the role does its own building and
installing. It also reduces the code maintenance burden,
because instead of duplicating the build processes in the
repo_build role and the service role - we only have it all
done in a single place.

We also change the role venv tag var to use the integrated
build's common venv tag so that we can remove the role's
venv tag in group_vars in the integrated build. This reduces
memory consumption and also reduces the duplication.

This is by no means the final stop in the simplification
process, but it is a step forward. The will be work to follow

1. Replaces 'developer mode' with an equivalent mechanism

It was decided that not all agents were able, or were not interested

These agents need to set virtual_agent key in their configurations

This patch aims to revert the commit meant to
fix api-paste.ini [1] that has no effect to
solve the path problem in distro installs based
on RedHat.

After the neutron_install.yml task responsible
to install neutron role packages, some config files
are placed in /usr/share/neutron, some of these files
are soft links from /etc/neutron from /usr/share/neutron.

One of the config files that is used by neutron-server is
the api-paste.ini that needs to be placed in /etc/neutron in
order to the service to initalize correctly.

This is a workaround only for RedHat distro installs
and the root cause is still being investigated.

* This fix drastically improves performance since it eliminates

  all such transactions would have to compete for the workflow

  and transaction retries. In some cases the number of retries
  even exceeds the limit (currently hardcoded 50) and such tasks
  can be fixed only with the integrity checker over time.

   only need to verify whichever one is the designated
   'openstack_service_setup_host'.

5. The memcache server connectivity test should have a short
   timeout, otherwise the task hangs for ages if it isn't
   working.

6. The rabbitmq vhost name is corrected and set consistently,
   otherwise those tests do not work.

7. The rabbitmq test venv fails to build for two reasons. One
   is that the venv creation fails, because virtualenv tries
   to download the latest pip/setuptools and fails due to the
   pip.conf restricting it. The second is that the python
   package 'pika' is not on the repo server. The task is changed
   to make use of the common python_venv_build role and to make
   use of pypi as an index when building the wheel.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

While it would have been better to directly use a native Zuul v3 job,
the work towards a common grenade job seems to be stalled.
Import the job locally and fix some issues:
- make sure that the heat_tempest_plugin is loaded correctly,
  so that the heat upgrade tests work;
- bump the starting point from stable/ocata (!) to stable/queens;
  it will be changed to stable/rocky when grenade supports it;
  will require additional fixes due to the standalone->uwsgi change.
- import lib/apache so that wsgi deployment works.

The older version of pylint being used does not work correctly under
python 3. In order to be able to update the pylint job to run under
python 3, we need to update the tool.

This patch updates to the latest version at this time. It also updates
and pins astroid, which was previously capped. Using a pin instead of
a cap should let us avoid issues with new releases while being
specific about which version to actually use.

The import-error linter rule is disabled because it appears in
Windows-related code that looks for modules we don't expect to be able
to find on the CI system under Linux.

The non-iterator-returned rule is disabled because it is erroring on a
class that doesn't make sense (freezer.utils.utils.ReSizeStream does
appear to honor the iterator protocol). Further investigation is
probably warranted on this one.

The public entry point for multiprocessing.SimpleQueue is the
top-level multiprocessing module, not multiprocessing.queues. The
linter correctly caught this error because the ctx argument was not
being passed to the class. The fix is to use the top-level entry point
to access the class.

basestring is no longer defined under python 3. The fix is to use
six.string_types, which correctly sets the alias to str or
basestring. By using the library, we can avoid having to tell the
linter to ignore the local customization.

The linter also caught a base raise, without an exception specified
and not in the context of an exception handler. I added an exception
using the pattern from the one on an earlier line.

Bionic requires a functioning gpg-agent to run apt-key add. This means
that gpg-agent must be working properly in the chroot when the nspawn
image preparation script runs.

Previous changes [1] have enabled apt-key to communicate with gpg-agent
during the nspawn_hosts role checks, however the cache prep fails almost
every time when nspawn_hosts is used within other role checks.

This is not a new issue, debian-installer is affected too [2].

This change adopts the same route as d-i, and simply copies the host
/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d directory to the nspawn image, removing the
need for apt-key and in turn gpg-agent.

This is a re-implementation of https://review.openstack.org/588962
for nspawn.

In order to radically simplify how we prepare the service
venvs, we use a common role to do the wheel builds and the
venv preparation. This makes the process far simpler to
understand, because the role does its own building and
installing. It also reduces the code maintenance burden,
because instead of duplicating the build processes in the
repo_build role and the service role - we only have it all
done in a single place.

We also change the role venv tag var to use the integrated
build's common venv tag so that we can remove the role's
venv tag in group_vars in the integrated build. This reduces
memory consumption and also reduces the duplication.

This is by no means the final stop in the simplification
process, but it is a step forward. The will be work to follow
which:

1. Replaces 'developer mode' with an equivalent mechanism
   that uses the common role and is simpler to understand.
   We will also simplify the provisioning of pip install
   arguments when doing this.
2. Simplifies the installation of optional pip packages.
   Right now it's more complicated than it needs to be due
   to us needing to keep the py_pkgs plugin working in the
   integrated build.
3. Deduplicates the distro package installs. Right now the
   role installs the distro packages twice - just before
   building the venv, and during the python_venv_build role
   execution.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

It also seems that Ansible became more strict about the permissions of
the current working directory[1] so we need to either move our ansible.cfg
to a better location, or get rid of it. In the zuul test environment, the
location is world-writable.

Given that this is an ansible.cfg used for tests only, that its content is
(mostly) duplicated in the wrapper's RC file and that implementation of
avoiding the wrapper was done when we had vars plugins (which we no longer
have), I think it's safe to remove it and use the wrapper instead.

Using the wrapper ensures that everything is set in one place, so it's
easier to find. In the AIO bootstrap we then just make sure we override
things that we do not want to interfere with the AIO bootstrap - then unset
them later so that the defaults get applied from then on.

To also reduce the duplication of the bootstrap-aio.sh script in the
gate-check-commit script, we source bootstrap-aio from gate-check-commit.

To make get-ansible-role-requirements usable for 3rd party Zuul based
CI, which may have test nodes that do not conform to the previously
hard-coded /home/zuul home path for Zuul workers, we need to make
this Zuul sources path dynamic based on the home directory of the
Zuul worker user.

However, we cannot rely on {{ ansible_user_dir }} inside
get-ansible-role-requirements.yml, since it uses become: yes. This
means ansible_user_dir will be /root, rather than the Zuul user's
home directory.

The solution is to pass the ZUUL_SRC_PATH that Zuul is operating
with into the OSA test job environment, and use this environment var
inside our role cloning playbook to locate the Zuul sources.

In order to radically simplify how we prepare the service
venvs, we use a common role to do the wheel builds and the
venv preparation. This makes the process far simpler to
understand, because the role does its own building and
installing. It also reduces the code maintenance burden,
because instead of duplicating the build processes in the
repo_build role and the service role - we only have it all
done in a single place.

We also change the role venv tag var to use the integrated
build's common venv tag so that we can remove the role's
venv tag in group_vars in the integrated build. This reduces
memory consumption and also reduces the duplication.

This is by no means the final stop in the simplification
process, but it is a step forward. The will be work to follow
which:

1. Replaces 'developer mode' with an equivalent mechanism
   that uses the common role and is simpler to understand.
   We will also simplify the provisioning of pip install

In order to radically simplify how we prepare the service
venvs, we use a common role to do the wheel builds and the
venv preparation. This makes the process far simpler to
understand, because the role does its own building and
installing. It also reduces the code maintenance burden,
because instead of duplicating the build processes in the
repo_build role and the service role - we only have it all
done in a single place.

We also change the role venv tag var to use the integrated
build's common venv tag so that we can remove the role's
venv tag in group_vars in the integrated build. This reduces
memory consumption and also reduces the duplication.

This is by no means the final stop in the simplification
process, but it is a step forward. The will be work to follow
which:

1. Replaces 'developer mode' with an equivalent mechanism
   that uses the common role and is simpler to understand.
   We will also simplify the provisioning of pip install
   arguments when doing this.
2. Simplifies the installation of optional pip packages.
   Right now it's more complicated than it needs to be due
   to us needing to keep the py_pkgs plugin working in the
   integrated build.

Neutron uses extensively the RYU framework (https://osrg.github.io/ryu/)
in its openflow related code. The group maintaining RYU has advised
the Neutron team that maintenance work will not continue after the
end of 2018. According to the discussion at Vancouver Summit,
the general consensus is to fork the RYU library under openstack namespace.
Neutron team will be responsible to maintain the fork.

To avoid confusion between the fork and the original library,
the neutron team picks a different name for the fork, which is ""os-ken"".

On bionic the network bridges refuse to be up, because the underlying
bond interfaces do not come up.

This change removes the bonds which were really only decorative, and plugs
a dedicated dummy interface into each bridge. This simplifies the config
and the bridges should come up as soon as the dummy interface is attached.

Several operations (e.g. stack check) are yet to be converted to
convergence-style workflows, and still create locks. While we try to always
remove dead locks, it's possible that if one of these gets left behind we
won't notice, since convergence doesn't actually use stack locks for most
regular operations.

When doing _check_status_complete() on a nested stack resource, we wait for
the operation to release the nested stack's lock before reporting the
resource completed, to ensure that for legacy operations the nested stack
is ready to perform another action on as soon as the resource is complete.
For convergence stacks this is an unnecessary DB call, and it can lead to
resources never completing if a stray lock happens to be left in the
database.

Only check the nested stack's stack lock for operations where we are not
taking a resource lock. This corresponds exactly to legacy-style
operations.

In order to radically simplify how we prepare the service
venvs, we use a common role to do the wheel builds and the
venv preparation. This makes the process far simpler to
understand, because the role does its own building and
installing. It also reduces the code maintenance burden,
because instead of duplicating the build processes in the
repo_build role and the service role - we only have it all
done in a single place.

We also change the role venv tag var to use the integrated
build's common venv tag so that we can remove the role's
venv tag in group_vars in the integrated build. This reduces
memory consumption and also reduces the duplication.

This is by no means the final stop in the simplification
process, but it is a step forward. The will be work to follow
which:

1. Replaces 'developer mode' with an equivalent mechanism
   that uses the common role and is simpler to understand.
   We will also simplify the provisioning of pip install
   arguments when doing this.
2. Simplifies the installation of optional pip packages.
   Right now it's more complicated than it needs to be due
   to us needing to keep the py_pkgs plugin working in the
   integrated build.
3. Deduplicates the distro package installs. Right now the
   role installs the distro packages twice - just before
   building the venv, and during the python_venv_build role
   execution.

* This fix drastically improves performance since it eliminates
  an unnecessary update of the workflow execution object when
  processing ""on_action_complete"" operation. W/o this fix
  all such transactions would have to compete for the workflow
  executions table that causes lots of DB deadlocks (on MySQL)
  and transaction retries. In some cases the number of retries
  even exceeds the limit (currently hardcoded 50) and such tasks
  can be fixed only with the integrity checker over time.
  See the code comment in the ""dispatcher.py"" module that explains
  why this specific change eliminates the update of the workflow
  execution object.
* Style changes in api.py and aciton_execution_checker.py

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

In order to radically simplify how we prepare the service
venvs, we use a common role to do the wheel builds and the
venv preparation. This makes the process far simpler to
understand, because the role does its own building and
installing. It also reduces the code maintenance burden,
because instead of duplicating the build processes in the
repo_build role and the service role - we only have it all
done in a single place.

We also change the role venv tag var to use the integrated
build's common venv tag so that we can remove the role's
venv tag in group_vars in the integrated build. This reduces
memory consumption and also reduces the duplication.

This is by no means the final stop in the simplification
process, but it is a step forward. The will be work to follow
which:

1. Replaces 'developer mode' with an equivalent mechanism
   that uses the common role and is simpler to understand.
   We will also simplify the provisioning of pip install
   arguments when doing this.

which resulted in decreasing auth-calls. The design of this hack includes
mocking the result of obtaining Deployment object.
After replacing Deployment component with Environment, the same
environment manager is shared across all checks. The hack was not
adopted after such change which resulted in obtaining platform data
(credentials in our case) from database[2][3][4] in each sample-check.
Since these checks are launched in parallel and the one env manager
object is used, there is a possible race condition when one thread already
""obtained"" data from database and contined validation, another
check rewrote self._env obj[3] which doesn't contain 'platforms'
by-default (it is done at the next line[4]). Since switching from line[3]
to line[4] takes ms, this race condition happens not often.

This patch removes the workaround. Anyway it stopped working after
switching to Environment component.
