The upstream rackspace image has a bunch of pip installed packages as
cloud-init was installed via pip due to a lack of available system

libvirt driver's get_connection is not thread safe in the
presence of a libvirtd restart during concurrent incoming
requests.

With existing code each will in turn call get_connection,
find the connection is broken, try to create new one, block
for a while and yield to the next thread to do the same.
You get as many connections as there are incoming requests
and only the last one is used finally. If enough are incoming
these connections can exhaust the client pool configured
for libvirtd.
One fix is to hold a lock while creating the connection.
Note that has_min_version calls _conn which calls get_connection
and thus the direct call to _has_min_version()

Also added the exception text if it fails to register an event
handler for lifecycle events.

jsonutils provides multiple benefits in comparison to pure stdlib json
(like using simplejson on Python 2.6).

Similar patch was already merged before [1], but since it lacked hacking
rule to enforce jsonutils usage, new occurrences of stdlib json module
usage were introduced.

This patch switches all the code to using jsonutils and adds a hacking
rule to enforce the rule.

The hacking rule requires that jsonutils module does not mimic as 'json'
thru using import renames, so the code was updated not to rename the
module when doing import.

The hacking rule was shamelessly copied from the corresponding nova
review [2].

This patch resolves following erorrs:
1. AttributeError: 'Server' object has no attribute 'reset'.
2. error: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor
3. Can't dup an SSL object

When the SIGHUP signal is received by the service launcher in
common service framework, it calls the server's reset method.
As reset method is not present in Sever class of
keystone.common.environment.eventlet_server module, it raises
AttributeError: 'Server' object has no attribute 'reset'.

After adding reset method when SIGHUP signal is sent to service
parent process, it stops the service and then calls service start
method again. When it stops the service, it kills the eventlet
thread, which internally closes the wsgi server socket object.
This server socket object is now not usable again and it throws
following error, while restarting the service:

error: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor

To resolve 'Bad file descriptor' error, creating duplicate
socket object, every time service starts.

As SSL object can not be duplicated, creating duplicate
socket object before converting a regular socket into an
SSL socket.

This patch extends the StoragePolicy class for non-replication storage
policies, the first one being ""erasure coding"".

Changes:

 - Add 'policy_type' support to base StoragePolicy class
 - Disallow direct instatiation of StoragePolicy class

 - Subclass StoragePolicy

   - ""ReplicationStoragePolicy"":
     . Replication policy, default
     . policy_type = 'replication'

   - ""ECStoragePolicy"":
     . Erasure Coding policy
     . policy_type = 'erasure_coding'
     . Private member variables
       ec_type (EC backend),
       ec_num_data_fragments (number of fragments original
         data split into after erasure coding operation),
       ec_num_parity_fragments (number of parity fragments
       generated during erasure coding)
     . Private methods
       EC specific metadata and ring validator methods.

 - Swift will use PyECLib, a Python Erasure Coding library,
   for erasure coding operations. This patch adds PyECLib to
   Swift requirements.txt. PyECLib is already an approved
   OpenStack core requirement.

Add support for performing a volume snapshot delete for
a network/(libgfapi)-attached disk based on the proposal
at:

http://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-February/msg01226.html

Uses a new VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_COMMIT_RELATIVE flag for blockCommit
calls which keeps qcow2 backing file entries as relative filenames
rather than prepending them with path information when blockCommit
operations are performed.

Support for this flag is required and heuristically detected rather
than based on version number.

Selection of disk for blockCommit/blockRebase is handled by
searching the snapshot hierarchy and using an identifier such as
vda[2] meaning the second item in the snapshot chain for disk
'vda'.

This change causes issues in parallel run, because routers
can disappear after listing.

The safe way would be to create the router by the test itself,
and maybe wait for scheduling.

Or using a pre configured router for example router1 created by
devstack.

For now it should be reverted.

Another enhancement would be to have a config run in action DELETE

Previously the autoscaling test triggered scaling down at a set
time after stack launch. This has some issues:
- it depended on synchronized clocks
- in the period before scale down, time is wasted doing nothing
- if scale-up took longer than typical, scale-down may occur before
  scale-up had finished
This change triggers scale-down by doing a stack update with
changed metadata as soon as scale-up is complete.
The consume_memory.py script now pushes artificial watch stats and polls the
metadata to find out whether to push a high memory value or a low one.
This test now runs quicker, is less race prone, and adds
stack updates to its test scenario.

Current version of graduate.sh have a series of drawbacks:
a) it rebases all commits to one straight line, which not only isn't
correct from history pov but also can introduce merge conflicts during
rebase (suggesting to finish script's work by hand);
b) it loses Comitter and Commit Date info overwriting it with Author and
Author Date correspondingly;
c) it runs expensive git-filter-branch 3 times with 3 different filtes
while it can handle them all at once.

This commit introduces following changes:
a) 3 filters are applied by git-filter-branch at once;
b) proper detection of all roots of files we need to keep (there can be
more than one);
c) keeping all commits along with their merge commits in order they were
in original repo;
d) as a side effect of doing all dirty work in filter-branch, all
metadata in commits is saved, and different runs of the script with the
same initial data provide the exact same results (all hashes are the
same).

Sort both lists so that the order is explicit when checking for equality

Note I am not actually familiar enough with oslo.messaging to know if
this failure is correct and the drivers or something deeper should be
returning lists with an explicit order. This would be the case if order

The L3 agent allocates link local address pairs used in connecting the
routers to the floating ip namespace.  When those allocations are
forgetten by restarting the L3 agent they all get rewired on restart.
This change preserves the allocations using a file in the local file
system.  Storing them in the database would be overkill and would
affect system performance.

All Barbican resources have a project-id in their URI. This helps to
correlate the resource with the specified project when no external
authentication mechanism is used. However, most Barbican deployments
would use Keystone to authenticate the API requests. With Keystone,
the project-id information is already obtained when the X-Auth-Token
header from the request is validated. This makes the project-id in the
URI redundant. This commit removes project-id from the URI.

Tests have been updated as well to not expect project-id in the URI.

Patch 3:
  removed unauthenticated-context from admin pipeline to fix
  tempest failure. version api doesn't need auth context now
Patch 4:
  refactored based on review comments
  removed the Noop policy enforcer class
Patch 5:
  rebased and fixed failing tests
  fixed issue in parsing performance_uri
Patch 6:

  pipeline is updated

Previously one was required to clone the congress source tree then
run prepare-devstack.sh and then stack.sh. After stack.sh completed one
might be left with two congress directories depending if they put it
in $DIST (/opt/stack) which could require them creating this directory and
chowning it to themselves. In addition, it would require you to install
realpath as a dependency. Instead of doing this we've updated this script to
just download the required files without haveing to clone the initial congress

This patch addresses the issue by removing the extra nesting
(which is effectively redundant).

The longer story about this patch is the following:

Race conditions may cause DBDuplicateEntry exceptions that
require a transaction to be rollbacked back, and yet make
the whole operation succeed. A classic example is what has
been solved in commit fbc6b99. If the rollback is done in a
nested transaction, the above mentioned exception is raised.

To address the problem, we could use savepoints by means of
sqlalchemy's begin_nested(); Even though this approach is
preferable, it causes quite a bit of changes in the unit
tests (because of sqlite); it may also require that certain
DBMS, or certain DB backend configurations, support savepoints.

In the end, the simpler approach was chosen.

After removing the last VM using a distributed router,
the router's namespaces are still present on the VM host
The problem is that the neutron API server sent the router
remove notification to the L3 agent using the name of the
host running the L3 agent instead of the agent's uuid. This
caused an error when sending the notification. So the L3
agent never had the chance to cleanup the namespace.
This problem is fixed here.

Afterwards, it was found that the notification was still not
sent. The reason is that the router/L3-agent binding has
already been deleted before the routine that sends the
router removed notification was called. The notifier routine
errored out when it tried to delete the same router/L3 agent
binding. This problem is fixed in this patch by removing the
binding removal step from the DVR scheduler.

Due to limited resolution of MySQL DATETIME type (in many cases and
by default even in cases where it is supported) subsecond resolution
will be trimmed off.

This fix will convert (for MySQL only) the expires_at column in
revocation event table. The new expires at column is backed by
a varchar(26) and automatically converts from Datetime objects
to ISO8660 (with subseconds) on process of param bind. On process
of result value, the ISO8660 string is converted to a normalized
Datetime object.

This patch changes the default behavior of osbash in order to improve
useability and better protect user data:

If the user asks for a cluster, the script no longer asks whether to use
a matching base disk (the prompt was added before the basedisk command
that allows re-building a base disk if needed).

If an existing base disk is used, VMs already attached to that disk are
no longer removed wholesale. They are removed only if and when they are
about to be replaced by a new VM of the same name. Among other things,
this will allow us to rebuild some nodes without affecting others.

This fixes the fields and filters units tests that break with a
randomized PYTHONHASHSEED (see the bug report).

The RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP is stored as a dict leading to an
unpredictable output order. Values in kvp strings are being stored as
sets underpinned by dicts when converted, leading to unpredictable
ordering of values when read.

Discovered with PYTHONHASHSEED = 2455351445 on these tests:
test_api_v2.APIv2TestCase.test_fields
test_api_v2.APIv2TestCase.test_fields_multiple
test_api_v2.FiltersTestCase.test_attr_info_with_convert_list_to
test_api_v2.APIv2TestCase.test_filters_with_fields
test_api_v2.APIv2TestCase.test_fields_multiple_with_empty

There are 3 parts to this fix:
1. Update the APIv2TestCase _do_field_list function to construct
field list in the same order as the controller constructs its list.
2. Ensure the APIv2TestCase _get_collection_kwargs maintains order
throughout.
3. Use new assertOrderedEqual function to sort values before assertion
in test_attr_info_with_convert_list_to

guestfs.GuestFS supports parameter python_return_dict with default
False in 1.22 (backported in 1.20). This indicates that your program
wants to receive Python dicts for methods in the API that return list
of tuples. See http://libguestfs.org/guestfs-release-notes.1.html
In a future version of libguestfs, its default value will be True,
then that will break the code, to avoid this, we'd better force
python_return_dict as False. See http://libguestfs.org/guestfs-python.3.html

This commit makes method inspect_get_mountpoints always return list
of tuples.

are loaded. Plugin loading precedence is used to ensure rackspace
versions will override core plugins with the same name.

The nova plugin will fallback to returning the core nova client
so that CloudServersTest will run even when pyrax is not installed.

The cloud_backed configuration option will no longer have any effect
on whether rackspace clients will be loaded. Instead they will be loaded
by stevedore via the setup.cfg heat.clients entry point.

Adds a local settings option to turn on/off instance name uniqueness
within projects. The settings property is set in local_settings.py
and is called ENFORCE_UNIQUE_PROJECT_INSTANCE_NAME. By default it is
set to false, which means duplicate names are allowed.

If set to True, duplicate names within a project may not be used for
new instances that are being launched, or for existing instances
that are being updated. In the special case where multiple instances
are being launched at the same time (count > 1) the instance id is
currently appended to the given name to ensure uniqueness. As a
result, in this case the duplicate name check would not be required.

Duplicate name check is case insensitive (as in other modals like
Create Flavor or Create Volume Type).

SELECT FOR UPDATE expression, which is triggered with the use of the

detrimental to performance and scalability of the database

SELECT FOR UPDATE can be entirely avoided in add_endpoint methods

For every class name, a request is made to the API server to retrieve
the package to which it belongs. This is unnecessary, since a package
contains a list of the classes it owns. This patch adds a second cache
to PackageClassLoader that maps class names to the package, and reduces
the number of calls for the io.murano classes to 1.

The second improvement is to add blank YAML definitions for system
classes (the function definitions are in python code) which allows
the engine to cache those, too.

Adds a more comprehensive test for the cinder volume resources:
- Creates a stack with a volume, and writes data to it
- Deletes the stack with the volume deletion policy set to
  ""snapshot"" (which really means backup) the volume
- Create a new stack with a volume created from the backup
- Prove the data written in the first stack is still present

New tox (>=1.7.0) sets a random python hash seed by default. This is
generally good for testing because it will help keep projects working
regardless of the hash seed, but incubator unittests don't currently
pass with a random hash seed so set it to the python default seed.

This change will allow us to use new tox again and remove the
restriction on tox<=1.6.1 to run unittests.

Redundant setenvs for specific test envs are removed to prevent them
from overriding the PYTHONHASHSEED value.

Note this change will need to be backported to the stable branches to
keep unittests there working with new tox as well.

Removes the condition that an authentication plugin knows the ""method""
name that is going to be used to call it. This condition prevents
different mechanisms like ""kerberos"" and ""saml"" from using the same
backend plugin.

The client should not know how the server is enforcing the Kerberos
authentication,  mod_auth_kerb or embedded Kerberos,  but the
mod_auth_kerb implementation needs to use the same implementation as an
X509 implementation.

The validation to check that the router has a GW IP
for the Cisco service driver was trying to directly
get the gw_port information, which is not available, as
the validator only has a dict of the vpn_service info.

Modified validator to get the router object (not a
dict representation), using the vpn_service's router_id
and then check the attributes for the router directly.

This patch removes the objectify decorator from the update_chassis,
update_port and update_node dbapi's methods. The problem with the
objectify decorator is that dbapi methods doesn't get the context,
so when forming the RPC object using the decorator we can't store the
context within the object (which is what we want to do to have consistent
object interfaces).

Also there are no parts of the code that is expecting the returned RPC
object from the dbapi.update_*() methods so we can just simply get ride
of the decorator.

It could be my implementation, but I had to make these changes to
get telemetry working.  Service type for me is metering.  If that
is not always the case, maybe there should be the ability to
supply multiple types or override through some mapping.  Also,
the v2.0 url did not work for me.

This reverts commit 9ae3c52104a2098b2566fe77e5420ec93b5875f7.

There are three issues:
 - it doesn't work on Ubuntu
 - upgrading the images on a cloud with old heat templates will 
   fail (needed to permit upgrading heat to transition to HOT)
 - upgrading an existing a/a cloud will cause 2/3rds of the 
   networks to stop routing until their networks are rescheduled. 

We need to fix all three things before landing this.

The metadata agent was unable to find networks
attached to the DVR router because it was only
filtering ports for 'centralized' routers.

To fix the issue, this patch expands the search
filters to include DVR router interfaces during
the network lookup operation.

The extra filter cause no evident performance
loss while serving the request; a different
approach would require to pass the router type
around to narrow down the search filter, but it
sounds like an overkill.

In this case, attempting to move some common
functionality out of the inheritance hierarchy
entirely (perhaps to the heat/scaling module).

Calculating the new capacity while taking
min/max constraints into account, seems like
some common functionality to any type of
scaling.  This way, the extra bounds checking

If the compute-agent starts before the collector directly

to establish connections. These lost samples impact the reliability
of tests which run immediately after the service [re]start.

Note: if there is a restart of the ceilo service, but not the AMQP
service, the problem does not present itself becaue the messaging

Note that this is a short-term solution of providing HA for
the services. Other temporary solutions like running l3-agent in a/a mode
and re-assign routers when a node goes down, might work better but
implementation would be much more complex and it would be still
just a temporary solution until l3-agent supports a/a HA (which is

This patch introduces the cliff framework from oslo.
The same functionality from the old command line interface was
replicated, and a few orthographic errors where corrected from the
command help.

The application structure was made so that it resembles the way
python-openstackclient was done, this will enable the code to be
integrated to that client in a more straight forward way. Same with
the naming of classes within the sub-commands. For example, the list
commands are List<Entity> and not List<Entities>; this was done in
such way because it is done that way in python-openstack client;
and the aim of this commit is to produce functional code, and at the
same time, follow their standards to be able to integrate this
there without much hassle.

Commit 7254f9b9dfbadadeb3aeda5d02bf37bfeb65e72d changed this method
in nova.network.api in a way that it now returns simply a list of
floating ip pool names, rather a list of dicts in the form

{'name': 'pool_name'}

The implementation of get_floating_ip_pools for neutron needs to
be changed accordingly. Otherwise nova's floating ip extension
will return a dict as floating ip pool names when neutron is enabled.

tree-filter causes git-filter-branch to checkout current tree for every
commit. That's rather IO-expensive operation. Given that tree-filter
runs ""git rm"" for every unneeded file, IO load becomes even higher.

With this change graduate.sh becomes less IO-bound and so runs way
faster (over 10x faster on my machine, even with tmpfs).

A cloud provider may have a need for custom code to examine stack requests
prior to performing the operations to create or update a stack.
Some providers may also need code to run after operations on
a stack complete. A mechanism is proposed whereby providers may easily add
pre-operation calls from heat to their own code, which is called prior to
performing the stack work, and post-operation calls, which are made after
a stack operation completes or fails.

ATTENTION: this solution conflicts with
https://review.openstack.org/112077

- Use SIGTERM instead of SIGINT for dhcrelay_monitor supervisor
  service, because we have ""sleep 30"" loop in the monitor script,
  so it will handle SIGINT only when sleep ends.
- Send KILL instead of INT to ""dockerctl attach"" process to make
  sure we don't stop any container during supervisor shutdown or
  restart. This should make supervisor restart much faster and
  it's safe for upgrade process since we're not shutting down any
  containers. Supervisor only monitors them and brings them up,
  but does not stop them.

Allow resource to check whether it is in an expected state and update
status and action accordingly.

This adds a check action to the stack that will perform checks in all
their resources and nested resources as well.  If a resource doesn't
have a handle_check() method, check for that resource will just pass.

If any resource at the end of a Stack.check() doesn't have a
handle_check() method, then a message will be added to the status_reason
of both the resource and the stack saying that CHECK is not (fully)
supported.  This allows for the other resources to implement their own
checks for their expected states.

Websockify version 0.6 bring with it several bugfixes and
new features that affect Nova (including a fix for
novncproxy zombies hanging around and better support for

backwards compatibility due to a refactor which brought
it inline with other Python socket server libraries.

The RBAC enforcer decorator used by all of the resource
controllers ensures that the tenant-id passed in the
uri matches the tenant-id that the request token is
scoped to. However, the decorator that passes the
tenant-id (a.k.a keystone_id) to the enforcer looks
for the keystone_id in the kwargs parameter instead
of the args list. This results in a ""None"" value
always passed to the enforcer. The enforcer compares
the keystone_id only if it is not None. This effectively
bypasses the check! This fix gets the keystone_id from
the args list. It also removes the check in the enforcer
that bypasses the check if keystone_id is None.

The unit tests were also fixed. The mock request context
setup by the BaseTestCase class leaves the ""tenant"" field
as None and this resulted in not catching this error!
This fix sets a valid keystone_id to the tenant in the
context. New tests are added to check for the fail cases
where the tenant-id from uri doesn't match the one in the
auth context

The dhcp agent only pushes out the metadata
static route when the subnet is isolated, and it
determines that by checking if the gateway_ip is
not set. This makes it tricky to use external
routers and metadata from dhcp at the same time.

This patch changes how the dhcp agent determines
that the subnet is isolated. It now considers it
isolated if there is no Neutron router on it.
This makes it straightforward to use an external
router on a provider network and get the
metadata from the dhcp namespace.

While keeping the existing PCI passthrough functionality intact, this patch
makes the following enhancements:
 -- whitelist:
    A whitelist entry is defined as:
      [""device_id"":""<id>"",][""product_id"":""<id>"",]
      [""address"":""[[[[<domain>]:]<bus>]:][<slot>][.[<function>]]"",]
      {""<tag>"":""tag-value"",}
    . <id> can be a '*' or a valid device/product id as displayed by the
      linux utility lspci
    . the address uses the same syntax as it in lspci. refer to lspci's manual
      for its description about the '-s' switch. In addition, you can also use
      ethernet interface names that represent SR-IOV physical functions. If the
      address corresponds to a SR-IOV physical function, all the PCI devices
      with virtual functions under the phsical function will match the entry.
    . the tag can be any string. But for scheduling purpose, only the tag
      ""physical_network"" is supported in this patch

    Multiple whitelist entries per host are supported as they already are.
    ""device_id"", ""product_id"", and ""address"" are fields that will be matched
    against PCI devices that are returned as a result of querying libvirt.

 -- PCI stats:
    A stats group is keyed by either:
    . (device_id, provider_id, extra_info) that exists today. or
    . {""<tag>"":""tag-value"",} that is introduced in this patch

   If a whitelist entry contains one or more tags, and there are devices
   matching the entry, a PCI stats group that are keyed with the tags will
   be created. If a whitelist entry doesn't contain any tag, then the existing
   behavior applies, and one or more PCI stats groups may be created for
   devices matching the entry.

   a PCI device is matched against the PCI whitelist entries in the
   order as they are defined in the nova.conf file. Once a match is found,
   the device is placed in a PCI stats group that are keyed according to the
   above rule.

 -- existing PCI alias and its use in the nova server flavor remain as they
    are today.

 -- examples of defining whitelist entries:
    pci_passthrough_whitelist = {""address"":""eth0"", \
                                 ""physical_network"":""physnet""}
    pci_passthrough_whitelist = {""address"":""*:0a:00.*"",
                                 ""physical_network"":""physnet1""}
    pci_passthrough_whitelist = {""address"":"":0a:00."",
                                 ""physical_network"":""physnet1""}
    pci_passthrough_whitelist = {""vendor_id"":""1137"",""product_id"":""0071""}

 -- boot instances with PCI passthrough devices remains unchanged
    refer to https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Pci_passthrough

 -- boot instances with SR-IOV ports:
    . define each whitelist entry that is applicable to networking PCI
      devices so that it's tagged with the physical network name with
      which its matching devices are connected

    Use the following commands to boot instances
    . nova boot --flavor m1.large --image <image-uuid> \
       --nic net-id=<net-uuid>,vnic-type=<normal|direct|macvtap> vm
    . neutron port-create <net-uuid-or-name> \
       --binding:vnic-type <normal|direct|macvtap>
      nova boot --flavor m1.large --image <image-uuid> \
       --nic port-id=<port-uuid-from-above> vm

 -- boot instances with SR-IOV ports and other PCI passthrough devices.
    This can be done by following the above two boot procedures

I think the case of Cinder, where correction is immense. Please also
consider the cost of the review itself in the future.

SSL Verification is from now on enabled by default.

This changes the default behaviour and is the primary intention of this
change: verify SSL certificates.

This might break existing configuration/setups where the SSL certificate
used by the SAN would not pass the verification.

Old behaviour can be forced by using `san_ssl_insecure=True`.

With this patch, in order to keep consistence with Nova,
volume state 'creating' should be shifted to the error properly.

When using LVMISCSIDriver and iscsi_helper tgtadm,
it should support chap unidirectional authentication
because target configuration file and db.volume has
record chap user and chap passwd.
By testing, tgtadm iscsi chap does not work.

We should fix the bug by setting user/passwd and binding it
to relative tid before leaving leaving the function
TgtAdm:create_iscsi_target, so as to harden chap authentication.
