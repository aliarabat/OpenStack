When invoke_api fails due to VimConnectionException it does not
always mean an expired vim session. It could be due to other
transient failures where the socket gets closed by the server.
To make it worse, vcenter doesn't support login call when a session
is already active. As a result, the re-create session may instead
fail.

This fix checks to see if the session is active before re-creating
the same.

Some tests require Nailgun to be running. For that a server is

requires more time to get up and running.

This patch allows users to specify maximum time of waiting Nailgun

Some scheduler filters that use aggregates have been converted
to use nova objects. This patch converts the remaining ones to
use objects. In both cases the calls to the database are
replaced by calls to a utility method that gets the required
data using Aggregate objects. In the future these utility
methods could be replaced with an implementation that works on
a cache - for now they do not change the behavior - its just
a refactor.

Alembic 0.7.1 is adding new diff directives add_fk and remove_fk.
The logic in execute_alembic_command() appears to assume all potential
commands are present in METHODS.   This patch adjusts it so that
it checks METHODS first, allowing the tests in neutron.tests.unit.db.test_migration
to pass.  However, if the design here requires that all potential
Alembic commands are handled, then this would not be the fix,
though I recommend that the potential list of Alembic directives
not be hardcoded.

Nova's XML support has been deprecated with a warning that it could be
removed as early as Juno. Now that we are in Kilo we are ready to remove
support.  Before actually doing the surgery to properly remove XML
support, intentionally break XML support in a 'clean' way, so if someone
freaks out that we are removing XML support we can easily re-enable it.

MongoDB has two restrictions on fields names, they cannot contain '.' and
start with '$'. In resource_metadata field we can get any data, so it could
be dict with any keys, and if some key contain i.e. dots sample with this
metadata wouldn't be stored in MongoDB.

To protect samples from missing this patch propose to check metadata
for occurrence of dots and '$' in keys if metadata is dict, and to transform
dict with dots before storing it in MongoDB. Transformation means that
we make dict more nested and new node appears where there is dot in dict
key.

It means that if we get metadata as a dict {'a.b.c': v} before storing in
MongoDB it would be transform in {'a': {'b': {'c': v}}}.

NetApp's five Cinder drivers have been in continuous development
for nearly 3 years, and it is now necessary to do some house-
cleaning.  This commit splits long files that contain multiple
classes, fixes the class hierarchies to enable subclassing
different driver classes (ISCSIDriver, FibreChannelDriver),
and renames classes.  It also begins the process of moving
unit test files into a matching hierarchy in the ""tests"" tree.

According to the Xen ML [1] ""qdisk is better supported and blktap is
unmaintained, we choose qdisk over blktap whenever possible"" (change was
introduced in Xen's commit 0166217 [2]). The Xen documentation states
that the disk driver ""should not be specified, in which case libxl will
automatically determine the most suitable backend"" [3]. However, even if
libvirt does it OK [4] not setting the driver name so that libxl chooses
the best backend, it sets the file format to 'raw' so that a wrong
backend will be chosen by libxl.  Since 'qdisk' seems to be the
preferred option, it seems safe to set it as the backend.

This is needed so that we can actually update the given topology with
the updated data after a successful claim.

Deleting it will also be needed when we actually make the resize work
properly for instances with NUMA topology, so we add it here as well.

We do not expose the new InstanceNUMATopology methods as @remotable to
avoid having to bump the object version thus making this an easier
backport target. This is OK since they are only called from
Instance.save() which is @remotable, and can be trivially made remotable
should this be needed later (causing a version bump that need not be
backported).

This commit adds the methods needed to enable fitting instances onto
NUMA nodes. It adds fit_instance_to_host() method to the
VirtNUMAHostTopology class that will do the fitting returning the
instance topology with it's cells assigned to the cells of a given host.

This method will be used in the scheduler and claims and will obsolete
the need for claim_test method which will be removed in subsequent
commits.

It is worth noting that after we transition filter and claims to use the
methods added to this patch - it will no longer be possible for an
NUMA-aware instance to be over-committed against itself no matter what the
over-subscription ratios are.

  On the 019_datastore_fix.py migration script the upgrade method was
calling the has_instances_wo_datastore_version as a function pointer
instead of passing the instance_table in and calling the function. This
meant the if block was always true because it was just checking if the
function exists and the create_legacy_version method was called everytime
causing the ""Legacy MySQL"" datastore to be inserted even if there was no
legacy trove instances. Now inject the instace_table into the
has_instances_wo_datastore_version and everything works as expected.

  Updated the datastore integration tests to not rely on the Legacy MySQL
datastore to exist by using the 10000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 GUID.
Instead the test now asserts against the data_store by the name
""Test_Datastore_1"" which is the datastore the integration test
intended to validate against.

Fixes the hostname validation to align with the RFC's demands[1].
This was done by replacing the full regex with a function that
broke the FQDN into individual components that were easier to
reason about with regular expressions.

Also added several test cases for domains so if someone wants
to convert it back to pure regex there will be better test vectors.

1. RFC 1123 says an all-digit hostname is allowed in section 2.1. It
   says that this more liberal syntax MUST be supported.

I added the switch_window method to pageobject, so that it can be
used by all pages.
The method switches focus between the webdriver windows.
Args:
- window_name: The name of the window to switch to.
- window_index: The index of the window handle to switch to.
If the method is called without arguments it switches to the
last window in the driver window_handles list.
In case only one window exists nothing effectively happens.
Usage:
page.switch_window('_new')
page.switch_window(2)
page.switch_window()

The motivation of writing it was to prevent the inconsistencies
encountered lately, and the common use of a deprecated similar method.
It is not meant for handling pop-ups.

I also modified test_dashboard_help_redirectionת so it now uses
the switch_window method.

When a VM is booted via the Nova the client connection is created
with an admin user. This causes problems when creating the neutron
port. That is, there may be a race for the creation of the default

To support in-tree functional api testing, the test class common
across all types of testing can't import modules that define
configuration that Tempest also defines because duplicate
configuration definitions result in runtime errors.  A previous change
(I44251db399cd73390a9d1931a7f253662002ba10) moved conflicting imports
to a separate module, but subsequent additions have added new conflicting
imports.

This change creates a new test class that is safe to use for all types
of testing (neutron.tests.sub_base.SubBaseTestCase), ensures that the
existing existing base test class (neutron.tests.base.BaseTestCase)
extends it, and documents their respective responsibilities.  This
will hopefully make it less likely that the functional api job will be
broken by changes to the base test class.

The library testing jobs aren't really about testing the libraries,
they are about sniff testing them in a live deploy. By only using the
neutron jobs we are effectively testing the entirety of the integrated
release, minus a *very* small amount of code in nova.

This will reduce the amount of random fail on these jobs, use a lot
less nodes, and achieve effectively the same results. Any n-net only
breaks that slip through should be addressed by other mechanisms,
because the likelyhood that n-net is so dramatically using libraries
differently from the rest of nova is vanishlying small.

Mock has a method called assert_called_once_with to check that a mock
was called and the arguments it took were as expected. Mock does not
have a method called assert_called_once and calling it just creates a
mock bound to that name. This means that not only is nothing tested
when assert_called_once is used, the tests also don't warn about this.

This commit attempts to address this in two ways:
    - all occurrences of assert_called_once are replaced with a real
      assertion.
    - the hacking check that nova uses to guard against this has been
      copied to cinder's local hacking checks.

Fixing the assert_called_once issues also highlighted other mistakes
in certain tests which were addressed to make the tests pass.

Due to the nature of mock, this issue is also possible if a method is
misspelt or just mistakenly used and so the hacking check is only
addressing one very specific case. That said, it does appear to be a
common mistake and so is worth singling out.

The existing floating_ip_bulk_create() DB API method used a for loop and
a session flush operation for each IP created. This patch consolidates
those many operations into a single INSERT statement, which will
perform better than multiple round-trips to the SQL database. We further
optimize the function by making a return of the changed rows optional.

rabbitmq uses host's hostname locally and hostname is
lowercased by cloud-init.

This is not a problem by default because controller node names in
default heat templates are lowercased. But this issue can be observed
if an older/different template is used.

While running unit tests I noticed that all of the test cases from
TestOvsNeutronAgent were taking just over 15 seconds.  This is because
it was waiting for the rpc call response timeout.  Since the tests
weren't actually failing, it's clear the code doesn't actually care
about the response anyway, so just set the messaging config to not
wait for the response.

On my dev box, this dropped test runtime for this file from 1024
seconds to 3 seconds, which is an obvious *HUGE* improvement.

Someone pointed out that an earlier change
(086496bfc45e01cd2905a074d526a7d513bf4ec2) intended to make calls
return immediately for *all* tests, but removing use of RpcProxy
caused this to stop working.

When the libraries that Cinder is dependent upon change their
config options it causes the cinder.sample.conf file to fail
the check_uptodate.sh check.  This causes issues in the gate and/or
people to push up patches with unrelated config files changes.

We don't want to remove the check_uptodate.sh run as it is good to
ensure that legitimate config file changes are committed.  A compromise
is to remove the generation of external options from the sample config file,
leaving just Cinder's options.

This patch implements that proposal by commenting out the
CINDER_CONFIG_GENERATOR_EXTRA_MODULES and
CINDER_CONFIG_GENERATOR_EXTRA_LIBRARIES environment variables in
tools/config/oslo.config.generator.rc .  Lines are added to the file
explaining why the options are commented out and explaining how to
regenerate the cinder.conf.sample file with the extra modules and libraries
if desired.

This patch also adds etc/cinder/README-cinder.conf.txt with a note
indicating that the existing cinder.conf.sample file is not a full set
of configuration options.  Directions are included for generating a
full sample config.  This approach is consistent with the approach taken by
Nova.

As a convenience, allow job execution searches to be filtered by 'status'.
This search key will refer to the ""info['status']"" field in a JobExecution
record.  Because the ""info"" dictionary is stored as a string in the database,
and because it contains values from clients that may also contain 'status'
entries in nested objects, a substring search filter on the query is not reliable.
Instead results are filtered by Sahara after they are returned from sqlalchemy.

apts aren't a thing, debs are. apt-get installs debs, like yum installs
rpms. Another option would be to rename rpms to yums, but that is even
sillier, considering then for suse we'd have to call it ""zypper-suse"" or
something, even though it would want to consume yums-general as a base.

should go away later.

Some cli commands allow specifying an image by either
its name or its ID. Creating a volume from an image
currently requires knowing the image ID. The request
was made to add the ability to create a volume using
the image name instead.

This patch adds the ability to accept either name or ID.
It will attempt to locate the image based on this input
and fail if neither can be matched. If found by name, it
will also verify there are not multiple images of the
same name. If this is the case it will require using the
ID to be explicit.

Will update python-cinderclient in a separate patch once
this has been merged to allow ID or name.

Allow user to disable VIP ping resource
if user does not need public network
to be routable.

Since 5.1.1 and 6.0 releases FUEL configures ping resource that checks whether default gateway is accessible in order to fix the corresponding bug:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1370510

Nevertheless, this fix imposes the issue that if user does not have pingable default gateway, deployment of OpenStack cluster will fail as FUEL uses public VIP to configure some of OpenStack entities (e.g. floating ip pools). In order to work this around, user can specify any pingable host as a default gateway, e.g. FUEL master node or apply the patch above and change cluster attribute 'run_ping_checker' to 'false' that will disable the pinger resource. In order to do this user will need to use FUEL CLI and add this parameter manually to the deployment cluster attributes.

Also, be aware that disabling of pinger will introduce back the corresponding bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1370510

Puppet blacksmith is a ruby gem that can handle pushing new puppet
modules to the puppet forge. Right now we don't have an automated
way to push to the forge, so this is a big win. Added it to the
'release' pipeline. This job runs on the 'pypi' node which is
pypi.slave.o.o, this node is not a single use node and is trusted
with secrets for pypi uploads, maven uploads, and jenkins plugin
uploads. When this node goes trusty, it might make sense for it
to be renamed 'trusted.'

A limitation of puppet-blacksmith is that it can only source one
set of credentials. I am working on patches to allow it to handle
different credentials with a config option. This would be needed
to publish both the openstack-infra modules and the stackforge
modules.

Puppet-blacksmith does not run any user-submitted code, so it is
safe to do the entire operation on the trusted node.

Remove usage of the RpcProxy compatibility class from the ml2
AgentNotifierApi.  The equivalent oslo.messaging APIs are now used
instead.  A couple of other mixin APIs had to be converted at the same
time.

Note that there is one very minor functional change here.  The base
rpc version is set to '1.0' now instead of '1.1'.  The right pattern
to use is to always set the base to be N.0.  Any method that needs a
newer version should specify it.

The backing VM corresponding to a volume is cloned during create volume
from another volume, snapshot or image. The backing VM is also cloned
during retype and backup restore. Currently, the target ESX host is
unset while calling vCenter CloneVM_Task API and hence the source ESX
host is used as the target. If the destination datastore returned by
the datastore selection logic is not accessible to the source host,
clone fails. This patch fixes the problem by setting the target ESX
host (returned by datastore selection logic) while invoking clone.

It turns out that we want unittest like things even when not running
unittests. Specifically we need things like subunit logs when running
functional tests. We should remove run-unittests and move to a single
tox runner script wherever possible. This means jobs simpler and results
in fewer surprises.

This change is the first in a few to make this happen. Step one
(implemented here) is to make run-tox.sh cover the use of
run-unittest.sh so that we can replace run-unittests.sh with run-tox.sh.
Once this is done and on all of our slave images we will convert all
jobs that use run-unittests.sh to run-tox.sh. Finally we can delete
run-tox.sh.

At some point we should consider doing similar for pep8 jobs and doc
jobs.

Bandersnatch and pypi have a failure case where uploading two files to
pypi very closely to each other results in bandersnatch thinking it has
synced serial X+1 which includes both the sdist and wheel but it really
has only synced serial X. But since X+1 is what bandersnatch thinks it
has done it will never sync the actual contents of the X+1 serial (the
second file uploaded).

To make matters worse the index.html for the project is synced assuming
both artifacts at serial X+1 were synced. This means any fetches for the
second artifact fail.

We can work around this by always uploading the wheel first. Pip prefers
wheels to sdists so uploading the wheel first ensures that the wheel is
synced properly, pip will prefer it, and our jobs should continue
running.

Eventually upstream pypi and bandersnatch will need to fix this bugs
properly but this is a reasonable thing we can do locally.

Change I09f70eee3e2777f52ce040296015d41649c2586a, introduced a bug where
the identity_headers are not added to the request headers anymore
causing the former to be completely ignored and useless.

This patch fixes that issue by restoring the previous code. A new test
has been added to avoid regressions.

Note: In this patch, I've made few additional changes to add retrying
logic because retrying library is not available in Icehouse.

Due to an error in logic of apply_changes method
we had problems with parallel deployment of controllers
as we were generating XML patch between live CIB and
shadow generated on the base of (sometimes!) older CIB.

This could lead to the problem that crm_diff removes
some of the data from the live CIB as it was not present
in the old CIB.

An example of such behaviour is the bug with location
constraints missing for virtual ip addresses as our
service provider was creating them in this window
between shadow creation and retrieving of the live CIB
thus crm_diff was generating patch removing this location
and leading to this bug.

One of the use cases for this is the ESX driver deprecation.
In order to enable a administrator to migrate all instances
running on the ESX driver to the VC driver they will need to
do the following:

1. OpenStack: terminate the nova-compute running the ESX driver.
2. VC: Create a cluster. The ESX server will be added to this cluster.
3. OpenStack: start a new nova-compute with the VC driver.
4. OpenStack: update the database to indicate that the instance
   will be running on a new host.
5. VC: Add the ESX server to the cluster

In order to perform item #3 above a new command has been added to
the nova-manage utility. This is as follows:

nova-manage db host_update --host <current host for ESX instance>
                           --new_host <the new host for the ESX instance>
                           --new_node <the new node for the instance>

The above command will update all of the instances so that they can be
run on a VC driver.

The backing VM corresponding to a volume is cloned during create volume
from another volume, snapshot or image. The backing VM is also cloned
during retype and backup restore. Currently, the target ESX host is
unset while calling vCenter CloneVM_Task API and hence the source ESX
host is used as the target. If the destination datastore returned by
the datastore selection logic is not accessible to the source host,
clone fails. This patch fixes the problem by setting the target ESX
host (returned by datastore selection logic) while invoking clone.

Instead of using a reader/writer lock in the cache types
just take advantage of the fact that single, non-mutating
operations on dictionaries are thread-safe in python.

This means we can remove the need to have simple read-only
operations using read-locks and can just use a simpler lock
around write-operations or around read/write operations that
span multiple dictionary operations (like iteration).

it starts and waits for other nodes to join.

Other nodes join with boostrap node when it's avialable instead of
waiting for cluster with at least 2 nodes (which would never happen).

On a compute node when the last VM with a floating IP association
is deleted, the L3 agent did not delete the fip namespace. However
the api server has already deleted the fip agent external gateway
port from the database.

This problem is happening on DVRs because the deletion of a VM port,
in addition to a floating IP disassociation, may also result in the
removal of the external gateway port binding AND the removal of the
fip agent external gateway port.

When the L3 agent is handling a routers_updated notification, it is
not processing floating ip address updates when the router has both
a floating ip disassociated and a external gateway port deleted.
This patch corrects this problem.

In Nova V2, when server is being created with long metadata, exception
OverLimit is thrown. But Nova V2.1 API has strong input validation
and catch long metadata during input validation only and throw badRequest.

This patch modifies the negative test to expect both exception.

This is needed to share V2 and V2.1 tests.

Commit bca4a0d82 moved oslo.concurrency.processutils to
oslo_concurrency.processutils which breaks the H302 hacking check in
several projects (nova/ironic/keystone/manila).

Pin oslo.concurrency under 0.3.0 until hacking is fixed and released,
then we can work on pinning oslo.concurrency >= 0.3.0 and moving
projects over to using the new oslo_concurrency module.

When we move modules out of namespace packages we set up redirects to
import the new module under the old name. Python's import machinery
doesn't detect those things as modules, and the names don't show up in
sys.modules. However, if we look at what we actually got when we did the
import we can see that it is a module.
