This commit adds a new config option to the config group to trigger
all the validation code. It also deprecates the run_ssh option in the
compute group since this will eventually be used globally. The intent
of this option is so that it will trigger both the creation of any
validation resources as well as used as run_ssh was originally
intended, to trigger ssh into nodes when needed.

For creating keystone user on customer stats opt-in we are using
astute 'execute_task' with type 'puppet'. Puppet granule
'workloads_collector.pp' used for it. Puppet manifest will be applied
only on primary-controllers of operational clusters.

If customer is opted-in to stats before cluster deployment - keystone
user will be created during deployment process without additional tasks
in the Nailgun.

On the opt-out action nothing is to be done by design.

Items of the change:

- Creating tasks on user creation added to the master node settings handler
- Task name 'create_stats_user' added
- Method for getting primary node added to the objects.Cluster
- Task CreateStatsUserTask for executing puppet manifest for creating stats
  user added
- Fake thread for processing astute 'execute_task' added
- Logging of the task CreateStatsUserTask into action_logs handled
- Extracted base test class for master node settings tests
- Parameter for workloads username renamed from 'user' to 'username' in
  deployment orchestration. It is required for proper 'workloads_collector'
  granule processing

The existing use of force_tenant_isolation seems to have been based on this
bug 1252971. We no longer have that
issue since there is no XML version, but I'm not sure why it was needed even
then if running tempest in a valid way. If tenant isolation is on then there
is no need. If not, then you are running serially, and there is no issue, or
you are using test accounts in which case there is also no issue.

This patch adds a set_config_files option that allows a tester to
force load a specific list of configuration files. It will override the
existing set of files, and trigger a reload of those configuration
files.

Note: This _does_ trigger the autodetection mechanism, as the
present state of oslo_config makes it so __call__ is the only thing
that sets self._args. After triggering, however, it immediately
overrides the detected file list and replaces it with the provided one.

When a deprecated opt is used and the new opt name has the dest
property overridden, we were logging the dest property instead of
the actual opt name in the deprecation warning.  This is confusing
because it leads to log messages such as:

Option ""username"" from group ""nova"" is deprecated. Use option
""username"" from group ""nova"".

This is nonsense.  In this case the proper new name was ""user-name""
but because it had a dest override of ""username"" that's what was
logged.

Because the deprecation check code does not have access to the
actual opt itself, we need to pass the undeprecated name down from
the opt into the namespace code that does the check.

I also tried simply adding a (group, name) tuple to the beginning
of the names list, but this subtly broke the CLI opt tests because
there are specific combinations of - and _ variants expected, and
this seems to violate those assumptions.  I did not pursue it any
further because I felt it was better to simply be explicit about
the current name and not mess around with adding non-existent opt
names to the lookup list solely for logging purposes.

Adds support to use VLAN tagged frames from VM when using the ML2 plugin
with the openvswitch mechanism driver. Extends port with 'trunkport:type',
'trunkport:parent_id' and 'trunkport:vid'. Type is either 'trunk' or
'subport'. If type is 'subport' then parent_id shall be id of port with
type 'trunk' and vid shall be vid that VM uses to reach this
subport. parent_id and vid shall be unset for ports of type 'trunk'. Ports
of type 'trunk' shall be argument to nova when booting VM. This commit
contains the server part.

After moving to oslo.config we still were using
incubator config generator.  This was ok, but the
problem is we haven't been pulling config options
from the oslo libs.
This is a hack that just appends external lib calls
and appends those options to the sample file being built.

Note that we just put all oslo libs from the requirements
file in here.  Even those that may not have any config
options associated with them.  Additionally, naming of olso
libraries matters here, using the new ""oslo_*"" convention
results in the generator not finding any config options in
a number of the libs (ie concurrency).

When associating a FloatingIP to a different private
fixed port in ""hostB"" without disassociating the existing
FloatingIP that is hosted in ""hostA"", the server does not
clean up the FloatingIP agent gateway port in ""hostA"" even
though if it is the last port that owns the floatingip.

This patch fixes the problem by checking if there is a host
change and if so it deletes the fip agent gateway port of
the old host, if there are no valid ports using the FloatingIP
in that host.

During the create-from-snapshot workflow, the cDOT driver clones
the flexvol backing a share, and a job is started to split the
clone from its parent.  The Tempest tests that exercise this
feature attempt to delete all artifacts created for the test
(child flexvol, snapshot, parent flexvol) immediately after
the test assertions.  This rapid deletion wouldn't normally
happen in the field, but during the Tempest runs the clone
split is still occurring during the cleanup phase, so the
cleanup fails.  There isn't a great way to detect and prevent
the issue, so the workaround is to intercept the error and
retry a few times.

Currently v2 and v2.1 have separate functional tests and their
corresponding sample files. As v2 and v2.1 are supposed to be identical,
there is overhead to maintain two set of functional tests and sample files.
We can have one set of tests which can run for both v2 and v2.1.

This commit merges servers metadata functional tests.

In V2.1 os-access-ip is separate plugin where in v2 it was mixed in server
plugin itself. So os-access-ip extension is enabled to run
merged functional tests for both v2 and v2.1.

During scripted snapshot image builds we remove python-setuptools on
rhel/centos 6. This uninstalls cloud-init on hpcloud centos6 builds
because cloud-init depends on setuptools. We don't actually need
cloud-init in hpcloud because they use dhcp and we have hard coded ssh
keys so just don't bother setting cloud-init config if the config dir in

One could argue that we would possibly want cloud-init to regen host
keys for us, but centos' sshd service should do that for us if the host

retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

We used to allow creating from source/snap and specifying a
different type than the originating resource when doing so.

Once we started getting more drivers and more multi-backend
configurations, we implemented a check in volume.api that
took this away (broke it).  There have been a number of
arguments about whether this should be allowed or not, and
that it could fail after the rpc call leaving the user with
nothing more than a ""failed"" volume and no explanation as to
why.

This patch allows the capability, but checks validity at the
API layer before issuing the create call.  There are two
requirements for the new type specification to be valid:
1. There is only one backend (cinder-volume) topic configured
2. Both types in question specify the same volume_backend_name

If neither of these requirements are met, the user will receive
an ""invalid type"" error explaining that the type combination is
not compatible and that they should omit the type argument altogether.

Yes.  It's included in the main openvswitch git tree and is maintained
by the ovs team.

- Is the library good code?

Yes.

- Is the library python 3 compatible?

More testing is required as it's not clear what testing has already
been done.  It has no additional dependencies and I'm not aware of
anything else that would make Python 3 compatibility difficult.

- Is the library license compatible?

Yes.  Apache 2

- Is the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu
  latest / Fedora latest)?

Yes.  This is already an OpenStack dependency.  It was just only
recently uploaded to PyPI to make testing in our CI easier.

- Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries
  in ``global-requirements.txt``?

No.

Added CheckRepositoryConnectionTask which tries to retrieve files from
repositories and fails if it cannot do it. This check is performed
before provisioning takes place, so it covers the IBP need
for master node to have access to repositories for building an image.

Above task is mocked for integration tests.

Fake task mode causes retrieving failed repositories method to be
replaced by method always returning empty list.

Old implementation didn't work, was using ad-hoc caching and its name
was too generic. Moreover it exposed 2 methods that should be private
as Shade aims to hide implementation details.

This change-set gets rid of extension_cache() and has_extension()
methods and create _nova_extensions() and _has_nova_extension()
methods.
Caching is performed using _cache_on_arguments decorator.

Images API now conforms to the new search interface. This required
us to no longer return a dict of images keyed by image ID, but, rather,
just a list if images.

The 'exclude' argument to get_image() was not being used by either
nodepool or the Ansible modules, so this was simply removed to make
that method conform to the standard interface. However, it is still
used by the Ansible modules in get_image_id(), so that functionality
is kept intact.

host entry mapping the hostname and FQDN to 127.0.0.1 into every image
built. This is probably useful for some use cases but not for all, so we
now allow customizing the manage_etc_hosts value via
DIB_CLOUD_INIT_ETC_HOSTS variable and also not writing the config at all
if that variable is explicitly set to an empty string (currently the
default is 'localhost' but in the future the default will be empty
string).

Particular description of the problem this causes in TripleO follows:

We get hosts files like this:

    ::1     localhost       localhost.localdomain   localhost6      localhost6.localdomain6
    127.0.0.1       localhost       localhost.localdomain   localhost4      localhost4.localdomain4
    127.0.0.1       ov-rl5i5saoc6h-1-hj5tzsbrdv4c-controller-dy6nuyarqy5z.novalocal ov-rl5i5saoc6h-1-hj5tzsbrdv4c-controller-dy6nuyarqy5z

    # HEAT_HOSTS_START - Do not edit manually within this section!

    # HEAT_HOSTS_END

The duplicate hostname/FQDN entry for 127.0.0.1 and 192.0.2.15 confuses
Corosync, which then fails to start a cluster when using hostnames in
the config file instead of IPs.

This change adds the ability to inject routes in interfaces.template
by injecting them in the template engine.

It adds support for injecting extra routes when instances are spawned
on networks that do not have DHCP or Neutron routers.

Routes are now found in each interface in the interfaces variable.

The following attributes are available for each route:
  * gateway (eg. 192.168.0.1)
  * cidr (eg. 192.168.10.0/24)
  * network (eg. 192.168.10.0)
  * netmask (eg. 255.255.255.0)

Example of how to inject routes in interfaces.template:

    {% for ifc in interfaces %}
    auto {{ ifc.name }}
    iface {{ ifc.name }} inet static
    # [...]
    {% for route in ifc.routes %}
        post-up ip route add {{ route.cidr }} via {{ route.gateway }} dev {{ ifc.name }}
        pre-down ip route del {{ route.cidr }} via {{ route.gateway }} dev {{ ifc.name }}
    {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}

Note: Routes are not injected by default in interfaces.template.
This is to avoid any potential conflicts with existing network agents
such as dhcp, l3, etc.

See nova/tests/network/interfaces-override.template for a complete
example on how to interact with the new interface 'routes' attribute.

Blueprint: network-template-routes-injection
DocImpact: Routes are now available in the network template engine.

It seems the tag was added with lower-case letters.  This is fine with
me as it is consistent with most, if not all, other tags in the

blueprint ipv6-router (ChangeID:Iaefa95f788053ded9fc9c7ff6845c3030c6fd6df),
supports an IPv6 Router where the router gateway port has no subnet.

The BP implements the following. If an external network (without any subnet)
is attached to the Neutron router, it reads the ipv6_gateway config parameter
(LLA of upstream router) from l3_agent.ini file and adds a default route that
points to this LLA.  If the ipv6_gateway config value is not configured, it
would configure the gateway interface to accept router advts from upstream
router to build the default route.

For an HA router, we would have to configure keepalived to perform this
operation. This patch extends the functionality to an HA router.

Sphinx orders TOCTree entries by filename but lists the title. This
means that when the filename doesn't match the title, the list appears
to be unordered. That looks untidy and makes it a devil to find the spec
you're looking for.

Ostf tests for glances fails sometimes when we use VMware backend. It
doesn't affect production using but can confuse users.

It happens when VMware glance's backend has to restart auth session
and the test's timeout expires by timeout on some step. Obvious fix is
increasing timeouts.

I increase each timeout because session's restart may happens during
passage any step but don't increase estimation of duration time because
it may happens only one time and doesn't changes full time of working
test.

of actions from the Project instance table.

This change corrects these references to redirect to the detail page
under the Admin panel group; updates the Admin detail page to use the
collection of actions from the Admin instance table.

Cinder is failing after upgrade to Juno. This is because of the
following race conditions:

  - Cinder takes time to update the current status of the services.
  - Cinder sometimes gets stuck at creating block device.
  - While creating block device, deleting that device is not allowed.
    This creates error and stops the script from running.

Fixes include some helper functions which adds to the robustness of
cinder test cases.

The Ironic Python Agent client library was limited and made supporting
more commands difficult (such as zap()). This adds a class to
represent the results from the commands, which should make development
a bit less error prone. Added improved error handling of connections
to the client and parsing of results. Fixed the agent getting queried
multiple times when prepare_image completes.

Most of the DB exceptions contain DB details which aren't caught by the
traceback hook. The cleanest way to ensure the proper error codes and
messages are being sent is to catch the DBErrors and wrap them as
IronicExceptions. This patch will show the DB details if debug is enabled,
but hides them behind a generic message if debug is False.

The patch tries to cover every possible case by wrapping all public methods
in sqlalchemy.api.Connection and reraising IronicDBError for all
unexpected database exceptions.

The Multi-Node Setup guide in README.md

guides users to use

where the SimpleScheduler doesn't actually exist in nova. Even
though this is just an example, it is misleading enough for a
beginner to put SimpleScheduler into local.conf. The resulting
error message where n-sch fails to start

    ImportError: No module named simple

Isn't intuitive enough and may takes the beginner long time to
locate what's wrong.

This patch replaces SimpleScheduler with a real existing

We can derive the correct hook type (and do some sanity assertions,
as in hook-poll) via the stack status, so it's slightly easier,
particularly for scripts, if you don't need to explicitly specify
the hook type.

The old options are retained for compatibility, and I guess they
will make the call slightly more efficient.

Currently using the breakpoints/hooks functionality on large trees of
stacks is a bit inconvenient, because you may set hooks in nested stacks
so the events aren't easily visible via the top-level event interfaces.

This has been addressed via the new --nested-depth option to event-list,
but it's still hard to determine (programatically e.g from a script) if
there's pending hook which requires clearing.

So this patch introduces an initial implementation of a specialized
event-list function ""hook-poll"", which filters the events and displays
only those events which have pending hooks (e.g those which have yet
to be signalled to clear them).

I expect the efficiency of the implementation can be much improved in the
future if we add a propert nested_depth argument to the heat events API,
and/or add a hook API which enables easier introspection of hook status.
The CLI interface should be reasonable in the event such rework happens,
but the current (slow) implementation will work with the API interfaces
we have available now in kilo Heat.

The consumer code is over engineered, it allows to override
everything, but the override is always done with functools.partial.

None of the child Class have the same signature, sometimes
the constructor use the parameter name as the parent class but for
a different purpose, that makes the code hard to read.

It's was never clear which options is passed to the queue and the
exchange at this end to kombu.

This changes removes all of that stuffs, and only use the kombu
terminology for consumer parameters.

Alse we don't hardcode anymore the tag and the channel in the consumer
class, to allow to change them without recreating a consumer object
in the futur.

more need to exclude the 'base' element; thus, the usage of -n for

usage, also removing the -n usage with it.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

Currently fuel only calculates pg_num and pgp_num for ceph pools as part
of the initial deployment. When additional nodes are added to an
environment it may be necessary to update these values for the ceph
deployment for optimal performance. This document explains how to do
this manually until this functionality can be rolled into the fuel

Having the dasboard in /dashboard doesn't feel right, especially
since there is no automatic redirect when people browse to the ip or
hostname. Which would be a natural first try. Moving to / now to make
the process behave in a simpler fashion.

Because of a packaging error the js/css wouldn't load properly, next
to that there is an issue with a supposed missing 'manage.py
compress' run. This is handled through Kolla now as well (for the
time being).
There is another supposed bug in packaging that makes webfont.ttf
return a 404. This is because of a missing alias for /static stuff,
and with moving the whole thing to / this gets adressed as well.

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

its test-requirements.txt should reflect the reality.

I've checked, and Ubuntu Trusy already has django-nose 1.2.
As for Debian (which I manage), it's not a problem either.
My only concern would be RedHat and Gentoo, for which I
don't know how to check. Please guys, voice your opinion.

It adds a call to the new check functions in ipmitool init.
So we can test the temp directory, upon startup to ensure that
the directory is usable.

These pre-flight checks do not change the need for valid

an operator that there is a configuration error that will
prevent the driver from performing as expected.

Also adds a missing unit test for the ipmitool drivers power

When checking for ports that are still in use on a DVR router,
the L3 agent scheduler makes the assumption that a port's
network must be owned by the same tenant. This isn't always
true as the admin could have created a shared network that
other tenants may use. The result of this assumption is that
the router associated with the shared network may not be
unscheduled from a VM host when the last VM (created by a
non-admin tenant) using the shared network is deleted from
the compute node.

The owner of a VM may not own all the ports of a shared
network.  Other tenants may have VMs using the same shared
network running on the same compute node. Also the VM owner
may not own the router ports. In order to check whether a
router can be unscheduled from a node has to be run with
admin context so all the ports associated with router are
returned from database queries.

This patch fixes this problem by using the admin context to
make the queries needed for the DVR scheduler to make the
correct unschedule decision.

Shift the implementation of LBaaS v1 from implementing inside
the monolithic plugin to the advanced service's driver model
so that it utilizes more upstream code.  As a consequence, the
following changes are included in this patch:

 * Since DB updates occur before the driver code is reached,
   change the validation logic of the pool-hm association
 * Similarly, update the LBaaS DB tables appropriately from
   the driver when validation errors occur
 * Split the driver into the API-based and the cluster-based
 * Organize the LBaaS unit tests so that both the cluster and
   API based driver tests run.
 * Set up devstack so that lbaas service is always enabled and
   sets the driver to the new MidoNet LBaaS driver.

The 3.0 release of futures removed support
for py2.5 and py3.1 and also enables the ability
to correctly retain the traceback of exceptions
on 2.x versions of python. This functionality
will enable much better exception tracking when
the futures/executor interface is used and would be
a welcome addition in futures using projects (and
helps aid the migration to 3.x which includes
tracebacks by default).

This release also fixes memory leaks, as_completed
and other various bugs that were previously occurring
with the 2.x branch.

The new home of this code also moved from google
code to https://github.com/agronholm/pythonfutures

When using the build-all-docker-images script the script will
build images that pull from a base image.  By default, Docker
is looking for that base image with the tag 'latest'.  If you
are building into you own namespace for the first time you will
likely not have all of the base images built with the tag 'latest'.

For example, if I build to my namespace for the first time.
The image rthallisey/centos-rdo-glance-base will be build and pushed.
Then, the image rthallisey/centos-rdo-glance-base:latest will be
pulled in order to build rthallisey/centos-rdo-glance-api and Docker
will fail to find that image.

The solution is to alert the user to tell Docker to look for a
specific tag or when building, add the argument '-t latest'.

In some environments, volume cloning fails when using the Windows
iSCSI volume driver. This involves creating a new VHD image and
copying the data from the source volume on top.

This can raise an error, caused by the fact that the destination
path exists.

This patch slightly changes the workflow used when cloning an image.
Instead of first creating a new WT disk and then copying the cloned
image data on top, the source image is copied, resized if needed
and then imported as a WT disk.

In the copy_vhd_disk method, it is assumed that if the copy operation
fails, a wmi.x_wmi exception will be raised. This is wrong. In fact,
none of the methods called there can raise such an exception in those
circumstances.

At the moment, this method will not raise an exception even if the
copy operation fails.

This patch adds a check to see if the source image actually exists.
The according CIM_DataFile Copy method's return value is checked as
well in order to see if the operation failed or not.

It is too easy to introduce errors into the gate scripts and not
notice; for example see Icd853c670dfd9bd067f472203b38dd258d90e8ba.  To
find problems like this, set errexit for the setup & cleanup helper
functions.

To facilitate this more cleanly we add a little helper function that
creates the commands.

Dependent changes should have made the scripts errexit clean.
cleanup_host is left for another change to avoid too much churn.

Note setting errexit globally in the devstck-vm-gate-wrap.sh script is
a little more trouble than it is worth; since the testing commands are
expected to fail if there is a problem, we need to continue with the
script to clean-up and copy the logs out.

You might think, hey, we could get around that by doing some variation
of

  a_function && rc=$? || rc=$?
  cleanup_fn
  return $rc

but there is a small trap with that -- running as part of a ""&&"" or
""||"" pipeline disables errexit for ""a_function"" -- thus by setting
errexit in the calling script, we effectively disable ourselves from
using it in functions we call that might fail!  This is a problem as
we're using bash functions as hooks all over the place.
