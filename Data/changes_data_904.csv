get_account_info used to work like this:

  * make an account HEAD request

  * ignore the response

  * get the account info by digging around in the request environment,
    where it had been deposited by elves or something

Not actually elves, but the proxy's GETorHEAD_base method would take
the HEAD response and cache it in the response environment, which was
the same object as the request environment, thus enabling
get_account_info to find it.

This was extraordinarily brittle. If a WSGI middleware were to
shallow-copy the request environment, then any middlewares to its left
could not use get_account_info, as the left middleware's request
environment would no longer be identical to the response environment
down in GETorHEAD_base.

Now, get_account_info works like this:

  * make an account HEAD request.

  * if the account info is in the request environment, return it. This
    is an optimization to avoid a double-set in memcached.

  * else, compute the account info from the response headers, store it
    in caches, and return it.

This is much easier to think about; get_account_info can get and cache
account info all on its own; the cache check and cache set are right
next to each other.

All the above is true for get_container_info as well.

get_info() is still around, but it's just a shim. It was trying to
unify get_account_info and get_container_info to exploit the
commonalities, but the number of times that ""if container:"" showed up
in get_info and its helpers really indicated that something was
wrong. I'd rather have two functions with some duplication than one
function with no duplication but a bunch of ""if container:"" branches.

Other things of note:

  * a HEAD request to a deleted account returns 410, but
    get_account_info would return 404 since the 410 came from the
    account controller *after* GETorHEAD_base ran. Now
    get_account_info returns 410 as well.

  * cache validity period (recheck_account_existence and
    recheck_container_existence) is now communicated to
    get_account_info via an X-Backend header. This way,
    get_account_info doesn't need a reference to the
    swift.proxy.server.Application object.

  * both logged swift_source values are now correct for
    get_container_info calls; before, on a cold cache,
    get_container_info would call get_account_info but not pass along
    swift_source, resulting in get_account_info logging ""GET_INFO"" as
    the source. Amusingly, there was a unit test asserting this bogus
    behavior.

  * callers that modify the return value of get_account_info or of
    get_container_info don't modify what's stored in swift.infocache.

  * get_account_info on an account that *can* be autocreated but has
    not been will return a 200, same as a HEAD request. The old
    behavior was a 404 from get_account_info but a 200 from
    HEAD. Callers can tell the difference by looking at
    info['account_really_exists'] if they need to know the difference
    (there is one call site that needs to know, in container
    PUT). Note: this is for all accounts when the proxy's
    ""account_autocreate"" setting is on.

This patch is for converting API Reference to RST and host it
in the Cinder tree.
This patch contains all the RST for cinder to bring over to their
repos to begin building API reference information from within.
This contains .inc files which have all the contents of the .rst files
but are grouped together for easier editing

This is the results of the RST conversion from WADL. It creates a
single index plus a bunch of included files which represent sections
of the API.

Cleaning task will be done once this part is merged.

As we have removed XML API support in Newton release, we need to
remove XML from API reference as well.

But we still have installations which are using XML.
So implementation plan is to first merge this patch in Newton release
keeping XML for now, then I will backport same to stable branches.
After that I will remove same from Newton release to match API
reference with actual API implementation.

Unfortunately, upstream has modified hz-expand-detail to *require*
that it be used only as part of hz-table. This otherwise convenient
utility locks searchlight-ui into using hz-table and smart table
where it doesn't really want to.

See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1580809

This change paves the way for a follow-on that removes the use of
smart table.

Previously, if you called get_account_info, get_container_info, or
get_object_info, then the results of that call would be cached in the
WSGI environment as top-level keys. This is okay, except that if you,
in middleware, copy the WSGI environment and then make a subrequest
using the copy, information retrieved in the subrequest is cached
only in the copy and not in the original. This can mean lots of extra
trips to memcache for, say, SLO validation where the segments are in
another container; the object HEAD ends up getting container info for
the segment container, but then the next object HEAD gets it again.

This commit moves the cache for get_*_info into a dictionary at
environ['swift.infocache']; this way, you can shallow-copy the request
environment and still get the benefits from the cache.

In Huawei cinder volume driver, replication feature will fail to
failover when there is a primary array error. The Implemented failover
steps:
  1. Split replication pair;
  2. Make the second pair readable & writable.

When primary and secondary array are normal, the split will succeed.
But when primary array is error, the split command sent to secondary
will fail, so failover will fail.

When error occurred on primary or secondary array, the running status
of replication pair will be abnormal (ERRUPTED). If the status is in
this case we should not do split.

Unconfined filesystems created through CLI in HNAS caused driver's
parser to break. It was found that the command breaking could be
replaced by another, already used command, which also retrieves
filesystem information, and it is preferred, so previous command
has been replaced.

Additionally, administrator may not want to automatically mount
an unmounted filesystem in DHSS=False mode, which may be unmounted
for maintenance, so changed behavior to not mount automatically.

This completes the validation for the admin event interface, including
detailing the codes we currently return in the parameter list.

Because os-service was incorrectly using the 'status' key, when I
renamed status => event_status I needed to also create a
service_status to make things compile. It's accurate enough to move
forward.

Because this is really a Neutron only API, this is moved towards the
bottom of the API list, to make it clear this isn't really designed to

This puts in the infrastructure for enforcing the section and
parameter name ordering in parameters.yaml file. It does so through
loading the lookup table as an ordered dict, and doing compare
operations to it during initial load.

The ordered dict loading is far more expensive than straight stream
loading, so a cache mechanism for file => loaded yaml is also
added. This reduces the sphinx build time to less than it was
previously, even though we are doing more processing of the data.

Once the parameters.yaml file is made compliant, we can move these
from .info to .warn and enforce the file stays alphabetized.

The nova.pci.manager.PciDevTracker.claim_instance() accepted an Instance
object and called nova.objects.InstancePCIRequests.get_by_instance() to
retrieve the PCI requests for the instance. This caused a DB lookup of
the PCI requests for that instance, even though in all situations other
than for migration/resize, the instance's PCI requests were already
retrieved by the resource tracker.

This change removes that additional DB lookup during claim_instance() by
changing the instance parameter to instead be an InstancePCIRequests
object and an InstanceNUMATopology object.

Also in this patch is a change to nova.objects.PciDevice.claim() that
changes the single parameter to an instance UUID instead of an Instance
object, since nothing other than the instance's UUID was used in the
method.

Use a consistent ""sl"" prefix for directives and filters to avoid
potential collisions with Horizon or other UI frameworks that might
attempt to use this UI.

Flatten the directory structure and change the module names to match.

Consistently use the module namespace on injectables.

Currently the javascript files are organized according to a Horizon
dashboard pattern and aren't consistently namespaced.  There is little
reason to have the plugin structure follow the Horizon pattern for a
particular dashboard plugin, especially when considering searchlight-ui
may be placed in Project, Admin or outside of any existing dashboard, or
potentially used outside of Horizon entirely.

This is a simple approach for defining policy defaults in code. A new
class is added which policies can be registered against and which will
be used for authorization. By moving all authorization through this
class we can be assured that all used policies are captured.

By ensuring that all used policies are defined in the code we can do a
few things:

1. A sample policy file can be generated using the defaults set in the
code. This sample will be exhaustive which the current sample is not.

2. We can generate a list of policies that a user will pass. This is the
starting point of exposing this information in the API so that clients
can know if they're allowed to do something before even attempting it.

However this goes a step beyond that. Some actions require multiple
policies to be checked before it is allowed. A grouping mechanism,
called capabilities, is introduced so that policy can be exposed in a
format that maps well to what users want to do. It can expose things
like 'boot_instance' which would indicate that the user passes the 42
policy checks in that path.

Further work is necessary to load the code defined policy and override
it with config defined policy. And sample file generation. Currently the
basic rules are not defined like 'admin_or_owner', and the sample file
output lacks sorting or formatting. The sample file can be generated
with the new 'genpolicy' tox target.

In order to allow nailgun-agent find out fake raid devices:
* MD with 'Raid Level' set to 'container' need to be found,
* undelaying devices from that MD should be filtered out from
  storage devices.

So, if /dev/md127 exists and is actually a contaner, then
* nailgun agent should skip it from reporting as container
  device can't be used as a block device,
* underlaying devices from that container (say, /dev/sda and /dev/sdb)
  shouldn't be reported as storage devices. Logic is simple,
  those devices can't be used too, as they're a part of MD.
* only actual MD (say, /dev/md126) which represent fake raid
  will be reported as a storage device.

It looks like we may have found the cause of the CI failures, zone
imports are stated during tests, but are not given time to complete.

This (eventually) means they clash with other tests, causing the
database is locked failures we've been seeing.

test_objects.compare_obj ostensibly takes an object and a db
representation of that object and compares them. However it is also
quite useful for passing in two objects for comparison. But the use of
db_obj[db_key] breaks when the object used in the comparison does not
have the DictCompat mixin.

By changing that to getattr(db_obj, db_key) it works both for objects
and dicts.

captureWarnings, which routes these messages through
the standard logging system instead.

This commit adds support for the oslo.messaging amqp rpc_backend
which enables the AMQP 1.0 driver. A proposed feature for the
Newton oslo.messaging release is an update to the AMQP 1.0 driver
to support a stateless messaging interconnect for RPC traffic [1].

This patch:
* use oslo::messaging::amqp resource
* add new parameters for the oslo_messaging_amqp driver
* update spec tests for amqp as alternate rpc_backend
* add feature release note

Ironic API v1.11 introduced a new ENROLL state for newly-registered
baremetal nodes. Logic to allow the user to specify which initial state
to use (either ENROLL or the older AVAILABLE) was previously in
python-tripleoclient; this patch moves it into this repo, along with
supporting utility functions and tests.

Specifically, we

 - add a `provide` keyword argument to utils.nodes.register_all_nodes;
   when set to True, newly-registered nodes should be transitioned to
   the AVAILABLE state;
 - import the utility functions wait_for_provision_state and
   set_nodes_state from python-tripleoclient;
 - change set_nodes_state to return a list of node objects rather than
   generating a sequence of UUIDs. This makes its results more useful to
   client code.

The RPCClient class is fully based on the _CallContext class.
I think it is redundant to have the same attributes in the RPCClient
as in the _CallContext just in order to pass instances with these
attributes to the _CallContext._prepare method (which is not so obious
because it can work with both _CallContext and RPCCLient classes,
though these classes are not in the same class hierarchy).

This patch tries to solve all these issues by including both classes
in a hierarchy and to make a little optimization by eliminating
dummy _CallContext instances creation on each cast/call in RPCClient.

The scenario without apache was a transition to test upgrade between non
wsgi with apache to wsgi with apache and was introduced during Liberty
cycle.
The scenario is not useful anymore, as we have a wsgi with apache
scenario working well.
Moreover, we were trying to stop Keystone service, which does not exist
anymore in Mitaka, and removed from distros in Newton. It causes beaker
jobs errors.
Let's remove this test.

When rebuilding / evacuating a VM, sometimes the execute method of
PlugVifs times out while waiting for a network-vif-plugged event for the
VM being rebuilt / evacuated. This is because the network_info passed in
for the VIF is not considered active. Because the host of the instance
is not changed to the destination host until the rebuild / evacuation is
complete, the network-vif-plugged event sent by the neutron server on
the controller ends up being sent to the source host's nova-compute
process. This results in the wait to time out.

This issue is sporadic because typically the network_info passed in is
considered active, so the execute method does not wait on anything and
therefore does not time out waiting for the network-vif-plugged event.

This changeset reintroduces the workaround of temporarily changing the
host of the VM before plugging the VIF. This means that the
network-vif-plugged event sent by the neutron server is sent to the
destination host's nova-compute, which is the process that needs to
receive the event, resulting in no time outs.

More investigation is needed to determine why the network_info is
sporadically considered inactive when initiating the rebuild /
evacuation.

The default flavor was introduced for the ec2 API. That API is
deprecated and this option is not used in functional code anymore
but in unit tests.
A follow up patch will deprecate this option. In the next cycle we
can then remove it. I've put the option to its own module to avoid
merge conflicts with the nova.conf.compute module.
As this option was the last one for the ""oslo.config"" generator
namespace ""nova.compute"", the generator file was changed too and
the nova.compute.ops module was deleted.

The messages for translation were omitting the attributes in
tags and HTML entities embedded in the translation strings,
thus they no longer matched the original HTML.

Additionally, HTML entities are mostly (but not always) decoded
by the browser before angular-gettext sees them, so we have to
emulate this behaviour in our babel extractor so the message

The metadata widget displays both available and existing
metadata for a given resource. For example, on images
you can click ""Update Metadata"" and it will show you
all of the metadata that you can apply on the left
and all the metadata that is already on the image
on the right. This is basically a vertical transfer
table.

Available metadata is structure as a tree and the
actual properties are ""leaf"" nodes. When you
transfer from left to right it is only supposed to
show actual properties and not the ""folders"". These
are the leaf nodes.

This was handled by filtering with the built in
angular filter [0] and was relying on a property
""leaf"" to be set to null. However, in doing research,
I found that the way angular handles null in filtering
changes between angular versions [0]. I tried various
options and could not seem to make it work, so this
patch changes from setting leaf from null to false.

This fix removes the console log, but also removes
an issue where sometimes you couldn't remove metadata
item that had previously been saved.

DeploySelectedNodesWithTasks is intended to run only specified set of
tasks on specified nodes. In Fuel 9.0 LCM serializers have been
introduced, hence tasks are skipped if their condition return 'False'
(and it does, since no changes may introduced).

This introduces inconvenience for operators, who want to run particular
task on nodes and do not care if there were changes or not. That's why
this commit introduces the '?force' HTTP parameter for the mentioned
handler. If 'force' is true, the task will be executed unconditionally.

This fix ensures that any plugins can run even if
their tasks depend on pre-deployment stage. This fix
puts plugins/manifests rsync and astute.yaml upload
even earlier than pre-deployment stage. Otherwise it
would put burden on plugin developers to update old versions
of their plugins to do things after pre-deployment-end
which makes no sense.

Nova has implemented a lock-free mechanism to get rid of select-for-update,

We implement this kind of lock-free mechanism for our db-lock.
As a result, the db-lock is much more efficient for galera.

As can be seen in logs of the periodic generation job, our cgit does a
weird thing where sometimes it returns a 404 page with content, and
sometimes a zero response (see [1] for example, the last number is
response size).  This appears to be an openstack CI issue; possibly
due to cgit caching or similar (see [2] for manual test).  It will
have to be investigated with the host apache logs.

This is resulting in a lot of projects incorrectly being picked up as
having plugins (I7116571d2a2b1fc3a61e5f1ed46ac2cbc244775a).  I'm not
sure if this problem is also releated to the original status-code
issues mentioned in the code, but testing shows that cgit is correctly
returning 404's for missing files (you can see in the logs [1]).  Thus
switch the logic to examine the return code which avoids this issue.

The metrics code was just looking at the deltas between the last thirty
seconds and the new sample.  The cycles it returned to nova were simply
how many cycles were used in that thirty second sample.

Nova needs a running total.  Unfortunately this is a little complicated
in PowerVM as the metrics code keeps the VMs total (no matter which host
it runs on).  That's a weird statement.  To clarify, the base metrics
code will actually move the CPU cycles of a VM onto its new host when it
migrates.  This is different from libvirt which tracks it via the
cycles spent by the process on the host (so post migration, the
'counter' resets to 0).

This means that a VM that spends a million cycles on the source host
will have the cpu cycle counter start at a million when it lands on the
target host.

This change set takes this into account by determining the thirty second
sample delta between the calls.  It then keeps an internal to nova (via
an in memory cache) the total cycles.  This should account for the Live
Migration situation noted above.

This patch makes the new LBaaSv2 Horizon panel available for use in
Mitaka. It differs from the original master commit
(I2b1d77983598fb14fbf9ff7f23870cf767135811) because it must account
for deployers who are still using LBaaSv1 in Mitaka.

If a deployer sets horizon_enable_neutron_lbaas to True and they have
LBaaSv1 enabled in neutron_plugin_base, they will get the old LBaaSv1
panels.

If a deployer sets horizon_enable_neutron_lbaas to True and they have
LBaaSv2 enabled in neutron_plugin_base, they will get the new LbaaSv2
panels.

If a deployer sets horizon_enable_neutron_lbaas to True and their
neutron_plugin_base doesn't have any LBaaS version enabled, they will
not see any LBaaS panels at all.

Release notes are included with the patch.

replaced by another, already used command, which also retrieves

has been replaced.

Additionally, administrator may not want to automatically mount

This is a squashed commit of 2 commits:

1)
Use keystoneclient python bindings for testing

The keystone CLI has been deprecated for a long time
in favor of python-openstackclient and
Icbe15814bc4faf33f513f9654440068795eae807 finally removes
the CLI from python-keystoneclient. This will be in the 3.0
release of python-keystoneclient.

tempest-lib is using the keystone CLI and the novaclient
functional tests are using tempest-lib (which is also
deprecated now).

This change removes the usage of the keystone CLI from
python-keystoneclient via tempest-lib and replaces it
with simply using the keystone v2 python bindings from
the client.

Original-Change-Id: I557acefbf363304ce24ac81566bb651cbfe09176
(cherry picked from commit a42570268915f42405ed0b0a67c25686b5db22ce)

2)
Make functional tests work with v3 keystone

This patch adds support of v3 keystone to novaclient's functional tests.

Various components in Storlets require to know the cluster config.
Examples are:
1. The functional tests need to know the keystone auth uri
2. The installation needs to know where are the proxies / object servers
3. The management scripts need to know about all the nodes.

Now all information is expected to be in a single json file used by all components
There is a template of such file in install/storlets/templates/cluster_config which
is used for the s2aio installation.

changes include:
1. Adapting the ansible scripts to use a dynamic inventory that uses the json
2. refactoring setup_functional_test.sh moving work to
   /install/storlets/install_storlets.sh
3. general cleanups and fixes to  the ansible scripts

Trying to use ConfigMap's in Kubernetes leads to an interesting
problem. We use the file name as the key and the contents of the
file as the text value. The ConfigMap is mounted on the container
as a volume and the key is then used as the name of the file. The
problem is that kubernetes has a limitation on the name of the
key

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.2/docs/design/identifiers.md

Which means we cannot use '_' in the name of the file.
