The source-repositories element attempted to prune stale branches from
the local cache repos but failed because it was fetching specific refs
instead of updating remote tracking branches. Address this by performing
an explicit `git remote update --prune` prior to other git operations,
then comparing the list of local branches to the list of remote
branches. Any branch that is present locally but not on any remote will
be deleted.

This has the side effect of fetching refs early, short circuiting much
of the ""fetch the ref we need"" code in this element. That code is left
in place as there may be corner cases where a git remote update will not
fetch the ref that we want requiring us to be more explicit.

When creating, updating or deleting a resource which is not
existing, senlinclient desired HTTPNotFound in the current
implementation. But when server requests go to openstacksdk,
openstacksdk will convert all notfound exceptions into its
own exception type ResourceNotFound. So Senlin client should
handle this exception instead.
There is an exception when listing nodes of a cluster, ResourceNotFound
exception will be raised only when printing the output, so there is
no need to catch it when getting the nodes.

This commit adds a generate_subunit.py script which is used to
generate a subunit stream with a single failure for a period of time.
It takes it 2 mandatory args and 1 optional to specify the start time,
stop time, and optionally the id for test (if one isn't provided
'devstack' is used) The resulting stream is written to STDOUT.

The intent here is to leverage this to inject 'test results' into the
subunit2sql db to reflect failures that occur before tempest (or any
other test suite) is run. This is necessary for the openstack-health
dashboard. (otherwise it makes our failure rate look much better than
it is) This is only needed until we get a zuul mysql reporter in place
which can give us the higher level run information.

The actual usage of the script will be addressed in a follow-up patch.

Recently, the gate jobs took too long to complete (between 2 to 8
hours). The reason is jenkins slave agent die during the test, which
cause the CI to re-start the whole test in a new VM.

The failure mainly occurred at magnum-api pipeline, but also occurred
at other pipelines. In term of distribution of test nodes, this
failure mainly occurred at OVH nodes, in which there is no dedicated
swap device. As a result, at OVH nodes, local disk is used for swap
when memory is over-consuming. It looks this leads to resource
starvation, which cause the failure.

This patch attempted to reduce the memory consumption of the gate
tests. In the api test, the number of worker nodes was reduced from
2 to 1. In all tests (api/k8s/swarm/mesos), the memory of worker node
was reduced from 1G to 512M.

The "";python_version='2.7'"" construct in requirements.txt requires
pip>=6 before it can be parsed correctly.  tox/virtualenv will usually
create the venv with the *system* pip version, which may be too old (eg:
python-pip is 1.5.6-7 in Debian testing at time of writing).

It seems tox/pip/setup.py all lack a clean way to specify dependencies
that will be installed before setup.py is actually invoked, so this
change hacks this in using the tox.ini install_command.

(This reverts this portion of Icf33533348b8b6088abe3d4de5a84f253fe3836d,
which inadvertently(?) removed this line amongst other tox.ini cleanups)

NOTE:This patch introduces support for ZeroMQ driver for cinder single
backend case.
Multi-backend will be addressed in the next patch as part of the
blueprint.

CHANGES:ZeroMQ driver requires hostname for message delivery as there is no
broker inbetween.
So, extract the hostname and feed to the messaging client for zeromq
driver.

For the record, ZeroMq is a very lightweight distributed messaging system
specially designed for high throughput/low latency scenarios.
Addition of support for ZeroMQ would help cinder scale out with high
performance and be highly available as there is no centralised broker.

The debug and info options need to be set before a subcommand method is called,
otherwise they are simply ignored. This is kind of irritating - other options
(for example -U, -A, -K) are usable after a positional command.

This patch refactors the pecan controllers and functional tests
by spliting the code in several modules in order to avoid excessive
growth and ensure some level of consistency as regards function
and classes defined in each module.

To this aim:
- The generic resource controllers are moved into their own module
- Other controllers, such as extension and quotas, are moved into
  their own module
- Functional tests are split into 3 modules: one for generic tests,
  one for request processing tests, and the latter for testing hooks.

Runs indexing for child plugins as part of the parent;
errors if a child plugin is specified in the 'type' list to index sync.

When a parent is indexed, it will create mappings for any detected
child plugins, and index their data. Child plugins must implement
a property 'parent_plugin_type' whose value is the resource type of
the parent; the _parent mapping field is applied automatically.

This should assist with a restriction in elasticsearch 2.x whereby
parent mappings cannot exist prior to child mappings being created.
Ordering is such that the parent will come last. It is also necessary
in Elasticsearch 2.x to assign a _routing value when indexing child
documents; this is left to a separate patch.

This patch continues work on making the connect_volume methods
more efficient. Using multipath -l to find the available multipath

the use of multipath -l.

This patch takes the FC code and makes it into a generic method to
be used in the ISCSI connector and the FC connector and updates tests.

this change, a user can issue GET /project by just
having a role on the project.

This patch also removes the 'rbd_flatten_volume_from_snapshot'
configuration option as it is no longer necessary.

With RBD's objectmap feature, it's no longer necessary to flatten clones
as a chain of arbitrary length has no impact on performance.

There is an added benefit of being less confusing to a user.  Even
though volume deletion is asynchronous from the client's perspective,
nearly all other drivers will carry out the operation successfully.
However for RBD, a snapshot with clones would raise VolumeIsBusy() even
though the client returns success on the command line or the API.
Confusion from both users and tempest tests make this change even more
compelling.

Shuffle strategy we use right now leads to increased reconnection time
and provides no benefit. Sometimes it might lead to RPC operations
timeout because the strategy provides no guarantee on how long the
reconnection process will take. See the referenced bug for details.

On the other side, round-robin strategy provides least achievable
reconnection time. It also provides guarantee that if K of N RabbitMQ
hosts are alive, it will take at most N - K + 1 attempts to
successfully reconnect to RabbitMQ cluster.

With shuffle strategy during failover clients connect to random hosts
and so the load is distributed evenly between alive RabbitMQs.
But since we shuffle list of hosts before providing it to Kombu, load
will be distributed evenly with round-robin strategy as well.

DocImpact
A new configuration option kombu_failover_strategy for Kombu driver is
added. It determines how the next RabbitMQ node is chosen in case the
one we are currently connected to becomes unavailable. It takes effect
only if more than one RabbitMQ node is provided in config. Available
options are:

 * round-robin: each RabbitMQ host in the list is tried in cycle until
   oslo.messaging successfully connects. Since oslo.messaging
   shuffles list of RabbitMQ hosts, the order of hosts in the cycle
   will be random and will not depend on order provided in config.

 * shuffle: oslo.messaging selects a random host from the list and
   tries to connect to it. If connection fails, oslo.messaging repeats
   attempt to connect to another random host. Oslo.messaging stops
   once it successfully connects to a host. Note that in each
   iteration a host to connect is selected independently of previous
   iterations, i.e. it might happen that oslo.messaging will try to
   connect to the same host several times in a row.

The option's default value is round-robin. Before the option was
introduced, the default strategy was shuffle. For the reasoning,
see the main body of the commit message and the referenced bug.

This patch expands the definition of a role to include an
optional domain_id, which is included in the uniqueness
contraint along with the role name.

The V8 role driver wrapper is updated to ensure that
older drivers are oblivious to this change (and an
attempt to create a domain specific role with a V8 driver
will raise a NotImplemented exception).

An additional item of note, is that since the uniqueness
constraint contains a nullable value, we actually store
a special value (as opposed to None) in the sql attribute so
as to still use the sql uniqueness constraint to ensure
we do not have race conditions in multi-process keystone
configurations. This special value is entirely hidden within
the sql driver and is not exposed to the manager layer and
above. We do not support domain specific roles in the LDAP backend.

Follow-on patches will modify the policy rules for the role
APIs as well as modify the implied roles mechanism to support
domain specific roles so that they are actually useful.

With this change, all Horizon unit tests pass on Python 3.4.

Changes:

* vpn/tests.py, firewalls/tests.py: Replace reverse_lazy() with
  reverse() to get a regular Python string. The lazy object caused
  failures on Python 3.
* routers/tests.py: Decode HTTP body to get Unicode on Python 3. It
  works also on Python 2.
* neutron.py: replace a/b with a//b to get an integer on Python 3.
* network_tests.py: remove useless copy.deepcopy() which caused a
  recursion error on Python 3.
* metadata_defs/tests.py: expect a different JSON error message on
  Python 3.
* tox.ini: remove openstack_dashboard whitelist, all unit tests now
  pass on Python 3 ;-)

Having the window maximise during a test run makes it difficult
to work with other windows, especially on a single-monitor
computer. This patch removes the maximisation call.

This patch also adds a ""local"" configuration mechanism to allow
developers to have local configuration of the integration test
environment without it affecting the git repository.

keep a stale lease around for way too long. See if this helps.

In some environments, the 'VIRTUAL_DISK_ACCESS_GET_INFO' access
mask is not handled properly, for which reason we won't be able
to open attached VHD images.

This patch fixes this issue by explicitly requesting read only
access mode, also setting the ""GetInfoOnly"" flag. The only issue
with this approach is that it's not supported on Windows versions
prior to Windows Server 2012, but that's fine as we've dropped
support for Windows Server 2008 R2.

Note that the ""VIRTUAL_DISK_ACCESS_NONE"" may look a bit odd but this
access mask is required to be set when using the V2 open parameters
structure.

This reverts commit 1e3ef64179919f6c532c9bde15530040d5c1fbaa.

This changed a default behaviour and broke tempest (and possibly more)
when version 1.16.0 was released.

A proper implementation that allows abbrev to be disabled without
changing the default will follow.

the middleware package of keystoneclient has been deprecated and
will be removed in the next release. migrate over to keystonemiddleware
where all future development for auth_token will occur.

Use the provided auth_token middleware fixture for mocking token
responses rather than our own custom caching mechanism. This is much
more stable and simplifies the process of creating the AuthProtocol
object in the app.

The FC hbaapi library can report invalid HBAs, which it cannot
handle.

For example, in case of a VMWare based VM, it can report the
SCSI controller as a FC HBA.

We can avoid having issues because of this by simply ignoring
adapters that could not be processed, logging a meaningful message.

The experimental bindep-using nova Python 2.7 unit test job is built
from a job-template now, updated for parity with the current state
of its traditional non-bindep equivalent, instantiated for nova via
a job-group, and added in the zuul layout with a project-template.
This is a preparatory step toward adding more bindep-based job types
and on a broader number of projects before we plan to cut over
official jobs to new non-bare/minimal DIB-based nodes.

The ical tox env on the irc-meetings repo will generate an index.html.
If it does generate an index.html and then fail to complete the tox-ical
job, the postbuild script will not be run. If the postbuild script
doesn't run there will be an index.html in the output directory, which
will be used instead of the apache DirectoryIndex module.  This will
obsure console.html makeing debbuging of the failure harder than it
needs to be.

To fix that for the postbuildscript to always run, which will rename
index.html to site-index.html if it exists.

Running functional tests in the in-process mode uses
the default value for proxy-server object_post_as_copy,
which is True. This patch adds support for an environment
variable to change this value to False so that the fast-post
mode is tested when running in-process functional tests.

The patch also adds a new tox environment func-in-process-fast-post
which forces in-process functional testing with
object_post_as_copy=False.

The motivation for this change, apart from enabling configurable
local testing, is to put support in place for an upstream CI job
that will actually functionally test the fast-post mode, which is
otherwise only covered by unit tests.

There are currently two gate jobs that run the functional tests:

- gate-swift-dsvm-functional runs the tests *twice* against a
  devstack swift service, once using tempauth and once using
  keystoneauth. The devstack swift service uses the default
  object_post_as_copy=True.

- gate-swift-tox-func runs the func tests in in-process mode
  which also uses tempauth and object_post_as_copy=True. This
  duplicates one of the config scenarios above.

With this change either the gate-swift-tox-func job or a new job
could run the functional tests using object_post_as_copy=False.

The metadata server currently doesn't pre-query for metadata and system_metadata,
which ends up generating *two* lazy-loads on many requests. Since especially
user metadata is almost definitely one of the things an instance is going to fetch
from the metadata server, this is fairly inefficient.

This patch makes us always pre-query the metadata twins when looking up (and
caching) the instance.

There has been a lot of discussion about how the current ""Neutron
stadium"" is working out.  Consensus seems to be that it has grown
quickly beyond what makes sense as a single official OpenStack team.
The first step for scaling things back is agreeing on some additional
inclusion criteria that helps with drawing the line for what should be
an independent OpenStack project.  See the following thread on the
mailing list for detailed discussion about this:

http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-December/080865.html

This patch applies the first piece of criteria that can be used to decide if a
sub-project should be a separate OpenStack Project team.  It also applies
the criteria against existing repos under Neutron.

Several projects are affected by the conditional install of the
mock module. The namespace in py34 is ""unittest.mock"" not just
""mock"".

Some projects unaffected are because mock is installed via a
dependency of oslotests.

Since libvirt 1.2.17 it is possible to select which block devices
should be migrated to destination host. Block devices that are not
provided will not be migrated. It means that it is possible to
exclude volumes from block migration and therefore prevent volumes
from being copied to themselves.

This patch implements new check of libvirt version. If version is
higher or equal to 1.2.17 it is possible to block live migrate vm
with attached volumes.

During volume migration, if the driver can provide the local
path for the source volume directly, there is no need to get
it via attaching the source volume.

This patch adds a new config option sparse_copy_volume_data
for all the drivers and checks if the method local_path is
supported by the driver. If sparse_copy_volume_data is set
to True, the local_path of the source volume can be used to
copy the data of the volume.

* removed general endpoint method, since we should be able to always specify

* removed fallbacks in specific_endpoint method, since this behaviour is not a
  very obvious one to the user and it should rather return an error than an
  unexpected result
* dry public, internal and admin endpoint methods
* removed obsolete private methods
* adapted method calls for admin_endpoint in libraries/cli.rb
* refactored set_endpoints_by_interface recipe to directly call address_for
  instead of address, since the recipe already checks for an existing attribute
  ..['bind_interface'] and therefore address would redirect to address_for
  anyways
* moved the nested hash order for the public, internal and admin attributes to
  to be more clear and to break all existing calls to fix them during the
  refactoring process of all cookbooks
  e.g: node['openstack']['endpoints']['internal']['identity'] is now
  node['openstack']['endpoints']['identity']['internal'] and can be moved into
  the identity cookbook. This also streamlines these endpoint attributes with
  the bind_interface and host attributes
* removed dependency on openstack-identity cookbooks by moving openrc recipe to
  opentack-identity (same for corrensponding specs and template)
* removed address method and use the address (or hostname) defined in the
  endpoints hash directly (logic to set this attribute should rather be
  done in a wrapper (with a fitting method) instead of a static and predefined
  one)
* removed set_endpoints_by_interface recipe since logic for defining the
  endpoints will be moved to wrapper cookbooks
* added helper method merge_config_options for generation of config hashes used
  in service config templates
* added template for openstack-service.conf.erb which can be used by all service

This adds the CORS support middleware to Keystone, allowing a deployer
to optionally configure rules under which a javascript client may
break the single-origin policy and access the API directly.

For keystone the paste.ini method of deploying the middleware was
chosen, because it needs to be able to annotate error responses
created by other middlewares. If one such middleware throws an
error - such as an error from sizelimit - that error response
must still have CORS headers in order to be readable by the
user agent.

This patch also includes tests to assert that the expected setup
entry points are present. It is expected that this test will be
refined in future patches.

EXPERIMENTAL Glance v3 API has been removed in favor of standalone API
(EXPERIMENTAL Artifacts API of v0.1).
This patch introduces a new process entry point to run on a different
port (9494 by default), with its own configuration file and a paste
config.

A controller stub for old /v3 api remains in the glnace.api package for
the compatibility with existing paste configuration which may reference
it. This stub returns a 301 redirects to glare endpoint if it is present
or 410 errors otherwise.

To reuse  the existing version_negotiation middleware some refactoring
has been made.

other cases the same return value is returned back to the caller.
It's not possible to return request_ids with None so for all cases
object of DictWithMeta will be returned from this method. Second
approach would be to return (resp, body) tuple from _update method
and wherever this method is called, return the appropriate object.
These changes will affect v1 version and since v1 is already
deprecated the above approach sounds logical.

This change is required to return 'request_id' from client to log
request_id mappings of cross projects.

2.18 - Establishes a set of routes that makes project_id an optional
       construct in v2.1.

The change on Nova-API side adds only check for existence of
""project_id"" at the url. It doesn't check microversion, so all latest
and previous microversions can work with or without project_id.
Proof: all functional tests are succeed on this change (several of them
       use latest microversion).

To cut down ""project_id"" from the url at the novaclient side, we need to
modify ``novaclient.client.HttpClient`` and
``novaclient.client.SessionClient``. This change requires splitting
Nova's related requests and the others(authentication, volume...), which
are still require ""project_id"" at the url.

It is a complex task, which can be skipped for now to unblock
implementation of further microversions.

Where grouping all of a Cinder backend's replicated volumes on a storage
array is not possible, vendors will need a list of volumes from the
manager at fail-over time in order to identify which volumes to fail-over.
This list should include all volumes that belong to the Cinder backend we
are failing-over.

With these volumes, a driver will then be able to determine which ones are
replicated (whether that is by volume type or all the volumes on the
backend) and fail-over each replicated volume individually.

This prevents drivers from accessing the Cinder database directly to
retrieve this list, as well as provides a solution for those who cannot
query their storage array to find all replicated volumes that belong to
a specific Cinder host on a specific OpenStack deployment.

Moves nested quotas closer to a usable state by:
  * Disabling -1 limits in child projects until a fix for those land
  * Pushing the logic of checking for parent down into the quota driver
  * Not silencing failure to get_project from Keystone

This patch also has some consequences that should not be overlooked,
for instance if a deployment is using Keystone v3 ""get_project"" must
be able to performed for the current project before *any* quota related
operations can be performed (including create volume).  This is required
for keeping quotas in a good state, and it will not affect anyone on
with only Keystone v2 deployments.

The last point to note is this patch will not fix any existing
deployments which have ""allocated"" quota in DB in an incorrect state
from using the current nested quota code with limits=-1.

POC to show how default child quotas can be fixed
by changing Keystone policy.json to allow admin_or_member to
retrieve projects, and then grabbing the project in the create_volume
path as well. A complete fix will involve:
* modifying policy.json in Keystone repo
* caching the project heirarchies on the Cinder side
* refactoring the quota mgmt commands so that get_project isn't called twice
* moving project helpers out of cinder/api/conrtib/quotas.py

For this POC to work, add the following rule to Keystone's policy.json:
    ""admin_or_member"":  ""is_admin:True or project_id:%(project_id)s"",
and modify the get_project line to be the following:
    ""identity:get_project"": ""rule:admin_or_member"",
