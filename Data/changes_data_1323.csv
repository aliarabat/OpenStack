Sometimes xapi returns with an internal error during unplug_vbd. This
patch adds a workaround for XenServer 6.2 by inspecting the error
message, and retry the unplug.

Existing domains do not get updated in the backend when new servers are
added or existing ones modified or deleted.
This is rectified in this fix by implementing methods in all of the backends.
Three abstract methods were added to the base module that all backends
inherit from and implemented in all backends.
The three methods implemented are create_server, update_server, and
delete_server.
The methods are called from central/service.py as needed.

Commit c7d80dd (Cleanup mount points automatically) removed the unmount
of $TMP_MOUNT_PATH/tmp/ccache in run_d_in_target() and moved the
""rm /tmp/ccache"" to elements/base/finalise.d/02-remove-ccache.  There
are two problems with this:

1) Not unmounting at the end of run_d_in_target() results in tmp/ccache
   being bind mounted muliple times on top of itself (three times, if you
   just run `disk-image-create base`).  It is eventually unmounted, but
   somehow the auto unmount code is confused, and tries to unmount it
   one more time than it was mounted, which results in an error like
   ""umount: /tmp/image.THQkZxQa/mnt/tmp/ccache: not mounted"".
   This doesn't actually break anything, but it's a little messy.

2) ""rm /tmp/ccache"" in elements/base/finalise.d/02-remove-ccache never
   succeeds in removing /tmp/ccache, because that hook is invoked by
   run_d_in_target(), *while* /tmp/ccache is mounted.

This present commit solves the above by moving the ccache setup glue out
of img-functions and into the base element's root.d.  This has the
following implications:

1) lib/img-functions is a little cleaner.

2) /tmp/ccache is available in the chroot during the root, extra-data,
   pre-install, install and post-install stages.  It is not available
   during block-device, finalise and cleanup stages as it will have been
   automatically unmounted by then.

3) /tmp/ccache won't be setup if you're building an image that doesn't
   include the base element.

The oslo.messaging library takes the existing RPC code from oslo and
wraps it in a sane API with well defined semantics around which we can
make a commitment to retain compatibility in future.

The patch is large, but the changes can be summarized as:

  * oslo.messaging 1.2.0a11 is required; a proper 1.2.0 release will be
    pushed before the icehouse release candidates.

  * The new rpc module has init() and cleanup() methods which manage the
    global oslo.messaging transport state. The TRANSPORT and NOTIFIER
    globals are conceptually similar to the current RPCIMPL global,
    except we're free to create and use alternate Transport objects
    in e.g. the cells code.

  * The rpc.get_{client,server,notifier}() methods are just helpers
    which wrap the global messaging state, specifiy serializers and
    specify the use of the eventlet executor.

  * In oslo.messaging, a request context is expected to be a dict so
    we add a RequestContextSerializer which can serialize to and from
    dicts using RequestContext.{to,from}_dict()

  * The allowed_rpc_exception_modules configuration option is replaced
    by an allowed_remote_exmods get_transport() parameter. This is not
    something that users ever need to configure, but it is something
    each project using oslo.messaging needs to be able to customize.

  * The nova.rpcclient module is removed; it was only a helper class
    to allow us split a lot of the more tedious changes out of this
    patch.

  * Finalizing the port from RpcProxy to RPCClient is straightforward.
    We put the default topic, version and namespace into a Target and
    contstruct the client using that.

  * Porting endpoint classes (like ComputeManager) just involves setting
    a target attribute on the class.

  * The @client_exceptions() decorator has been renamed to
    @expected_exceptions since it's used on the server side to designate
    exceptions we expect the decorated method to raise.

  * We maintain a global NOTIFIER object and create specializations of
    it with specific publisher IDs in order to avoid notification driver
    loading overhead.

  * setup.cfg contains entry point aliases for backwards compatibility
    purposes. I don't love this and, in future, we may allow such
    aliases to be passed to get_transport() and Notifier().

  * All of the messaging options are now removed from nova.conf.sample
    because the sample config file generator doesn't yet know how to
    pick up these.

  * We use messaging.ConfFixture in tests to override oslo.messaging
    config options, rather than making assumptions about the options
    registered by the library.

The porting of cells code is particularly tricky:

  * messaging.TransportURL parse() and str() replaces the
    [un]parse_transport_url() methods. Note the complication that an
    oslo.messaging transport URL can actually have multiple hosts in
    order to support message broker clustering.

  * proxy_rpc_to_manager() is fairly nasty. Right now, we're proxying
    the on-the-wire message format over this call, but you can't supply
    such messages to oslo.messaging's cast()/call() methods. Rather than
    change the inter-cell RPC API to suit oslo.messaging, we instead
    just unpack the topic, server, method and args from the message on
    the remote side.

    cells_api.RPCClientCellsProxy is a mock RPCClient implementation
    which allows us to wrap up a RPC in the message format currently
    used for inter-cell RPCs.

  * Similarly, proxy_rpc_to_manager uses the on-the-wire format for
    exception serialization, but this format is an implementation detail
    of oslo.messaging's transport drivers. So, we need to duplicate the
    exception serialization code in cells.messaging. We may find a way
    to reconcile this in future - for example a ExceptionSerializer
    class might work, but with the current format it might be difficult
    for the deserializer to generically detect a serialized exception.

  * CellsRPCDriver.start_servers() and InterCellRPCAPI._get_client()
    need close review, but they're pretty straightforward ports of code
    to listen on some specialized topics and connect to a remote cell
    using its transport URL.

Conductor was doing a copy.copy() on the inbound object to later
detect changes that should be sent back to the caller. This does not
copy things like Instance.system_metadata and thus is incapable of
properly detecting changes that should be tracked.

This patch makes conductor use obj_clone(), and imports Chris
Behrens' __deepcopy__ fix for objects so that deepcopy works.

Conductor's logs should include tracebacks only when something
unexpected happened, which is why we have the client_exceptions()
decorator. The object_action() and object_class_action() methods
are used for direct remoting of object methods, and thus really
should forward *any* exception to the client.

This patch does that, and also adds missing tests for these two
methods to verify the normal and exception-wrapped behavior.

on ports where an instance could renew its ip address again after
dhcp_release has already been executed. To fix this, the order of

This is the last part of the series to implement support
for AutoScaling UpdatePolicy.

Modified handle_update of InstanceGroup and AutoScalingGroup to
support rolling update if there is an update policy and when
there is a property difference in LaunchConfigurationName. A new
replace method is created to handle replacement of instances in
batches. Replacement of instances occurs prior to resize. The
_lb_reload is called appropriately for each batch. The resize
method is refactored to support underlying changes in
_create_template.

1) The install guide was lacking a sample architecture section

This adds one and includes an image, with a followup image
in the basic networking section.

2) The instructions for disabling NetworkManager were given for
all distributions. This is not necessary on Ubuntu Server or Suse
server

3) the network configuration samples were only for fedora
this adds one for ubuntu, and a placeholder for SUSE

4) you need to restart the network after making changes

5) ubuntu sets services to start on install, no need to
restart or chkconfig (which doesn't exist on ubuntu)

6) ubuntu does not have openstack-config or openstack-db

This install has now been verified for ubuntu from the beginning
to the end of the identity service install.

- The original heat wadl (heat-api-1.0.wadl) and the samples have now
been deleted from this repo. The wadl has been renamed and migrated
to the following location along with the samples:
https://github.com/openstack/api-site/blob/master/api-ref/src/wadls/
orchestration-api/src/v1/orchestration-api.wadl

- Inserted api-ref/src/wadls/heat-api/src/README.rst file in repo
that specifies the new wadl location.

- Updated pom file to latest version of clouddocs-maven-plugin.

- Currently clouddocs-maven-plugin 1.11.0 has a bug which creates
new sections for the request and response examples for each API
call. This will be fixed in an upcoming release of the plugin.

- Several remarks are inserted in the manual text and marked with
security=""writeronly"" so they do not appear in the output. You
are welcome to provide any answers and feedback you may have for
these remarks.

- Fix title for commit to resolve H803 build exception.

- Fix extra spaces in file /wadls/heat-api/src/README.rst, and
wrap lines in commit message at less than 70 characters.

Currently if the SolidFire driver is configured but the cluster
isn't available for some reason the ensure_export call will raise
an unhandled exception and crash the volume-service.

We should be able to handle things like loosing connectivity to
a single back-end without impacting the other volume-service
backends.

We'll wrap the ensure_export call in a try block here and
return None in the case that the connection can't be made.
This will keep the service from crashing and log an error
message that the connection timed out.

Additional work would include adding a periodic retry task
to the manager to try and start the backend service for us
on some regular interval incase the device comes back.

The current implementation perform snapshot of attached volume.
This is invalid because when we take snapshot of the backing, the instance
continues pointing to the readonly delta and tries writing to it.
This patch will disallow snapshot creation of attached volume.

We have similar issue with delete of snapshot, when deleted the instance will
point to an invalid disk file, since that will get merged with its parent.
Hence any writes by the instance will fail with disk not found error.
This patch will ignore delete snapshot of attached volume.

Since we disallow snapshot of attached volume, we disallow linked clone of
attached source volume and also upload of attached volume.

This lets you build python-swiftclient packages that don't require pbr

rpmbuild / debuild, but not on the machines that install the packages.

Unfortunately, this does not make python-swiftclient able to be
installed via pip 0.3.1 on Lucid; you'll need to uninstall the system
python-pip package and install a new pip some other way. Given that
pip < 1.3 doesn't perform SSL certificate validation for pypi (trivial

via 'integration_bridge' in the 'vmware' section).

calling wait_for(), which would result in a bit of code duplicate but would

Storwize family uses flashcopy for snapshot or volume clone. The
volume delete has to wait until flashcopy finishes or errors out.
The _delete_vdisk() will poll volume FlashCopy status in a loop.
This may block volume serivce heartheat since it is in the same
. The solution is to use openstack FixedIntervalLoopingCall
to run the FlashCopy status poll in a timer thread.

The cinder volume mananger will resume delete operation for those
volumes that are in the deleting state during volume service startup.
Since Storwize volume delete may wait for a long time, this can cause
volume service to have long delay before it becomes available.
A greenpool is used to offload those volume delete operations.

Before we called 'power status; power on' in a loop which made the
IPMI/BMCs not behave well.  Also the total time we would wait (2.5
seconds wasn't always enough).  So make sure power on/off is only called
once and wait up to 10 seconds for the power state change to go into
effect.

This patch has been tested on real baremetal using
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO/TripleOCloud

This bug is also linked to ironic so the change will be made there as
well.

boto 2.14 has some interface changes with the get_http_connection

existing non optional parameters. It's a special kind of incompatible
change.

We are already special casing around boto in the unit tests, lets
just do more of that if we are running on a newer version.

This adds the base for a structured field definition, which gets us
away from just using simple coercion functions to define our fields.
That gets messy and spreads code to coerce data apart from the
serialization and deserialization bits.

This aims to unify and better define our data types in objects.
Note that this change doesn't affect any of the *actual* format
of the fields, which is highlighted by the general lack of change
to the actual object tests as a result.

In order to make boot order more flexible based on the block device

libvirt, by specifying more than one boot element. For more info see
http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsOSBIOS. Currently the boot
element is hard coded to ""hd"" by the libvirt driver.

This patch makes it possible to specify more than one boot element that
will give us more flexibility.

We currently have a requirement for mox >= 0.5.3.

Confusingly there are two flavours of ""mox 0.5.3""
in the wild:

1) pypi's mox-0.5.3.tar.gz (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mox)
2) Google's mox-0.5.3.tar.gz (https://code.google.com/p/pymox/)

These are not exactly the same; tests which can pass on (1) may
fail on (2).

Fedora packages are based on (1) while Debian/Ubuntu packages
are based on (2).

This is a known issue: https://code.google.com/p/pymox/issues/detail?id=40

When running the tests using a virtual env (1) is used, but
on Debian/Ubuntu when not running using a virtual env (2)
will be used: this leads to 3 of the 1740 tests failing.

This patch allows all 1743 tests to run whether you are running
in a virtual env or using Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora packages.

Storwize family uses flashcopy for snapshot or volume clone. The
volume delete has to wait until flashcopy finishes or errors out.
The _delete_vdisk() will poll volume FlashCopy status in a loop.
This may block volume serivce heartheat since it is in the same
. The solution is to use openstack FixedIntervalLoopingCall
to run the FlashCopy status poll in a timer thread.

The cinder volume mananger will resume delete operation for those
volumes that are in the deleting state during volume service startup.
Since Storwize volume delete may wait for a long time, this can cause
volume service to have long delay before it becomes available.
A greenpool is used to offload those volume delete operations.

There's the potential for racy behavior in test_show_watch, because
the result of show_watch(self.ctx, watch_name=None) is all watches
visible to the user, not only those for a specific stack.  So it's
possible that the result length will be more than two, and since the
watch name is also not unique, we could see spurious test failures.

So make the test assertions more specific, and avoid reusing the same
watch name in test_show_watch_metric.

Registering a keystone endpoint for rados-gw confuses Glance into using

backend (see also PRD-2012, PRD-2013).

This change drops objects_swift option from release.json and sets
objects_ceph in the setup wizard based on the Glance storage backend
selection made for images_ceph. Settings tab sets the images_ceph
checkbox when objects_ceph is set, and unsets objects_ceph when
images_ceph is unset.

Refactor on-disk knowledge out of the object server by pushing the
async update pickle creation to the new DiskFileManager class (name is
not the best, so suggestions welcome), along with the REPLICATOR
method logic. We also move the mount checking and thread pool storage
to the new ondisk.Devices object, which then also becomes the new home
of the audit_location_generator method.

For the object server, a new setup() method is now called at the end
of the controller's construction, and the _diskfile() method has been
renamed to get_diskfile(), to allow implementation specific behavior.

Changes nec-agent to catch RPC exceptions in the main

- nec-agent dies with RPC timeout in secgroup RPC
  (Closes-Bug: #1235106)

- port_added message can be dropped when RPC timeout occurs
  (Closes-Bug: #1235111). Moves exception catch from PluginApi
  to the main daemon loop.

test_nec_agent.py is added during Havana.
The base class and related tests are imported.

This patch enables the plugin to deal correctly with
newer versions of the NVP platform; this is done by
allowing the plugin to fall back to the closest known
version of the NVP platform. This is acceptable behavior
as L2/L3 operations implemented by the platform are most
certainly backward compatible.

This patch also improves test coverage for this part of the
code, which is critical to the correct behavior of the plugin.

If authenticating with a valid token (i.e., token auth, not
username/password auth), novaclient would instruct keystone to issue
a new token with an identical expiry to the one used, and pivot
onto it.  This makes it appear as though Nova is leaking Keystone
tokens.

Since there's zero benefit to issuing a new token that is ostensibly
identical to the perfectly good token used to authenticate, make
novaclient keep using the token it already has after successful
validation, and not issue a new one.

This patch set adds a new pair of tests to the
AuthenticateAgainstKeystoneTests class, which parrot the current
authentication pass/fail tests, but exercise the new code paths

Also adds a fix by Joe Gordon to make os_cache work correctly.

When the first subnet is created, the dhcp port is created and
midonet plugin correctly adds the static route to reach the MD
server in create_port. When a second or following subnets are
created, a new ip is added to the dhcp port. This patch takes
care of adding the static route to correcly reach the MD server
in update_port. This fixes the problem of VMs not being able to
reach the MD if assigned to the second subnet

This commit adds a fixture class to be used instead of external
locking with the synchronized decorator. When running tests in
parallel the synchronized decorator won't synchronize the tearDown

LockFixture the unlocking is done by using addCleanup() ensuring that

By default, a number of serious exceptions were not being
logged. Adding a logger for 'django'-related logs resolves this.

Also:
 - Add loggers for missing clients and django_openstack_auth
 - Add a default level for individual loggers (what makes it out to

Autor: Raildo Mascena <raildo@lsd.ufcg.edu.br>

Glanceclient removes the API version from the endpoint in case it exists. Look the following code:

https://github.com/openstack/python-glanceclient/blob/master/glanceclient/shell.py#L310

    def _strip_version(self, endpoint):
        """"""Strip version from the last component of endpoint if present.""""""

        # Get rid of trailing '/' if present
        if endpoint.endswith('/'):
            endpoint = endpoint[:-1]
        url_bits = endpoint.split('/')
        # regex to match 'v1' or 'v2.0' etc
        if re.match('v\d+\.?\d*', url_bits[-1]):
            endpoint = '/'.join(url_bits[:-1])
        return endpoint

The rest of code includes the API version in use accordingly.

Many of the tokens shipped in the test suite are set to expire in
2112. If running the test suite on a 32-bit platform, it will
fail, as the timestamps can't fit in 32 bits.

Actually, for token validation, there is no need to check seconds,
we can use datetime object comparison directly to avoid 2038
problem for 32-bit system.

NOTE: This patch just enables running unittest, the root cause is
that token memcache stores expire time in seconds instead of
timestamp string. This will cause further problem which is not
covered by unittest yet, and since many unittest code use this
feature, it is not suitable to fix them in this patch.

NOTE: No unittest is added for this change because it is not
testable since Jenkins is using 64-bit system.

reverting to list, which avoids the crazy quoting we had to do.

Currently, the default options value provided are not validated, which
can trigger fun things like a IntOpt having a ""foobar"" as default value,
with code failing later when the option is being used.

This patch introduces a _validate_value method that can be used to
validate the default value to the expected type.

ConfigOpts.__call__ gains a validate_default_values arguments that can
trigger default value validation. The argument is False by default in
order to not break existing code.

Ultimately, we could in a later version validate the default at Opt
object creation time, which would be much better, but that may break
existing code, so we'll see.

Align the hacking version between test-requirement and global requirement.

-    if logical_line.startswith(""self.assertRaises(Exception)""):
+    if logical_line.startswith(""self.assertRaises(Exception,""):

then more cases are detected by this change. Fix the exposed H202 error.

There is a special test case:

this line can not generate proper parameter for self.manager.update,
add a parameter ""endpoint"" for it, according to the

Wrap certain session and query methods, and catch exceptions caused by a

in a loop until it succeeds, or until we time out. The time out is
configurable with min, max, and increment options. The current defaults
will result in 20 retries spread over 155 seconds.

As a result of better disconnect error handling, we can remove the
ping_listener() which generated spurious ""SELECT 1"" queries.

However, we can not yet disable pool_reset_on_return; doing so would
cause dangling transactions and lead to random failures between threads

Even though 'floppy' is a valid device type, libvirt driver was
not supporting it.

This patch makes the bus for floppy devices be defaulted to 'fdc' if not
specified, when running libvirt with KVM.

Also it makes the device name prefix for devices on the fdc bus default
to 'fd' so that it is possible to default device names for floppy
devices. It also makes the fdc count as valid bus for kvm/qemu
hypervisors.

This effectively adds support for the floppy devices in the libvirt
driver.

Some non-major fixes to unit tests of wsgi controllers and functional
tests.

Savanna/Murano deployment tags add

Function discovery_check from wsgi_utils.py has been modified: all logic
that provides creation of set of deployment_tags was moved to function
_get_cluster_depl_tags (_request_to_nailgun replacement) which also handle
all requesting process to nailgun. nailgun_mimic.py was modified to
support providing of new fixture data for testing purposes. Tests for
function _get_cluster_depl_tags were added in new file
test_support_utilities.py.

Unified deployment tags.

For nose discovery plugin unified treating (casting to lower case) of deployment tags for
testsets and tests were added. Unit tests were modified in order to
support new logic.

Huawei HVS driver supports QOS and Tier functions. User can
open those functions by setting volume type. QOS requires users
to set flow strategy and io priority. Tier requires user to set
distribution policy and transfer strategy.

The current driver limits the QOS strategy to be ""Qos-high"",
""Qos-normal"" and ""Qos-low"" which is not direct, and just allows
user to set distribution policy: ""Tier-high"", ""Tier-normal"" and
""Tier-low"".

This patch changes the keys of QOS and Tier and adds transfer
strategy for Tier. Also it checks QOS strategy status when adding
new lun to the strategy.

The current implementation perform snapshot of attached volume.
This is invalid because when we take snapshot of the backing, the instance
continues pointing to the readonly delta and tries writing to it.
This patch will disallow snapshot creation of attached volume.

We have similar issue with delete of snapshot, when deleted the instance will
point to an invalid disk file, since that will get merged with its parent.
Hence any writes by the instance will fail with disk not found error.
This patch will ignore delete snapshot of attached volume.

Since we disallow snapshot of attached volume, we disallow linked clone of
attached source volume and also upload of attached volume.

We currently have a requirement for mox >= 0.5.3.

Confusingly there are two flavours of ""mox 0.5.3""
in the wild:

1) pypi's mox-0.5.3.tar.gz (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mox)
2) Google's mox-0.5.3.tar.gz (https://code.google.com/p/pymox/)

These are not exactly the same; tests which can pass on (1) may
fail on (2).

Fedora packages are based on (1) while Debian/Ubuntu packages
are based on (2).

This is a known issue: https://code.google.com/p/pymox/issues/detail?id=40

When running the tests using a virtual env (1) is used, but
on Debian/Ubuntu when not running using a virtual env (2)
will be used: this leads to 3 of the 1740 tests failing.

This patch allows all 1743 tests to run whether you are running
in a virtual env or using Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora packages.
