Recently, CentOS released version 7.3.1611, which triggered a latent
bug in fuel-library puppet scripts related to differentiating between
6.x and 7.x major versions: 7.3.1611 is wrongly detected as 6.x,
leading to the wrong packages being attempted to be installed,
leaving nailgun server service broken on the Fuel Master node.

This change forces the match at the beggining of the version string
(e.g. ""/^6.+/: {"" instead of ""/6.+/: {""), so the new CentOS 7.3.1611
no longer matches the condition for 6.x).

This change have introduced an issue, when the libvirt unix socket
is created after Ceilometer start. The pollster is disabled when
it should wait that libvirt come up.

The intent of the original bug was only to have a cosmetic logs
when the configuration file is wrong.

Also I don't see a safe way to disable the pollster when we can't
connect to libvirt, the reason is always unknown from Ceilometer PoV.

When using swift multi-tenant store, using a user's service
catalog to obtain the storage url for an object does not work
if the image was not created by the same user. This is because
the user's context, if used to establish a connection, would only
be looking at a location url formed with the wrong owner information
resulting in an object GET failure (404).

This patch solves this issue by a 'revert in principle' to the old code
logic where the storage_url for an image when using multi-tenant store
was fetched from the database via 'location.swift_url'. The change
that had introduced the fetch of storage_url from user's context is [1].

All functional jobs don't need a full devstack vm
but only some packages to be installed

So we can leverage the bindeps.txt feature to just install
our package requirements.

This change adds new jobs to use a non-dsvm.

Once the new jobs are working we will switch them to voting
and remove the dsvm one.

This patchset adds a new method to the OpenStackCharm() class called
'update_api_ports()' which, by default, uses the api_ports static member
of the same class to expose the ports using the Juju 'open_port' and
'close-port' commands. This method will open any ports that aren't
already open and close any ports that shouldn't be open according to the
Juju 'opened-ports' command.

The 'api_ports' static member can be overriden by providing a simple
list (or other iterable) to the method call.

By default, the default 'install' method on the OpenStackCharm() class
now calls update_api_ports() after it has installed the packages.  This
is normally what a charm would want to do: install the software, which
usually results in it starting, and then expose its ports. In order to
disable the default behaviour, it is necessary to completely override
the default install() method.  This is intentional, as the charm should
normally expose its api_ports.

Also, the update_api_ports() is called from the (new) update_charm()
method which can be accessed using a defaults 'update-charm'.  This is
so that ports can be changed when a charm is upgraded.

There are two distinct DNS resolution problems. One, the nodename
reverse DNS resolution. And two, resolution of peers. This attempts
to fix both problems.

Nodename is only required when rabbitmq runs multiple instances on
the same host. Having this set complicates the DNS requirements.
Removing this setting may simplify the DNS problems this charm has
faced.

For peer resolution force the use of hostname rather than dynamically
attempting to resolve one from an IP. Set /etc/hosts with the local
hostname and with each peer.

Standardize the way an IPv4 or IPv6 address is selected throughout
the charm. Standardize the way a hostname is selected throughout the
charm.

Henderson,kyleh,"Wait for lsyncd rsync to finish successfully

Add logic to the lsyncd rsync configuration to wait for a
successful rsync event before issuing the postcmd. The existing
code issued the postcmd immediately after spawning the rsync,
which caused a race condition.

Currently  we have lot of validation code inside
server tag controller class which can be moved to
json schema.

Same can be reused on other place also.
For example, microversion 2.40 adds server tag while
boot. Same schema can be used there.

Current python code validation shows conceret error message about each
tag where using json schema error msg will be like below-

For requesting tags more than max limit:
Invalid input for field/attribute tags. Value: ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4',
'5', '6', ...] is too long

For requesting tags more than char limit:
Invalid input for field/attribute 0. Value: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' is too
long

I think those error message are clear enough to understand the wrong
tags.

This patch is moving a conditional preventing whole disk images from
being deploying in UEFI mode unless the boot_option capability is
explicitly set to ""local"" from the pxe.py module to the ilo/deploy.py
module.

This conditional is an inconsistency because whole disk images being
deploying in non-UEFI mode don't need to explicitly set the boot_option
from ""local"", also, in Ironic when deploying a whole disk image we
already assume local boot by default.

Using keystone swift client with session
with swift_image_store configuration options.
Using keystone glance client with session.
Providing backward compatibility.

Summing up, two main puproses of this patch are:
  - complete general migration to keystone sessions
    (using sessions for glance and swift)
  - get rid off the mess in swift-glance configuration
    options and move swift-store related options to
    separate section

So that the options swift_api_version, swift_account, swift_tempurl_key
are moved to ``swift_image_store``, but it is recommended to use
swift session, in which case these options are not needed at all
and the exact needed information is obtained from swift account created
by keystone session.

Adding constraints support to libraries is slightly more complex than
services as the libraries themselves are listed in upper-constraints.txt
which leads to errors that you can't install a specific version and a
constrained version.

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper script to
edit the constraints to remove oslo.config.

Replace the git commands for determine the tags on a branch with calls

Because the Scanner class scans for the tags when it is created and
caches the data, we need to update the tests to instantiate the Scanner
after the git repo is created and the test commits are applied. The main
API entry point into reno is the Loader, and that is not changed because
the Loader does not instantiate a Scanner until it knows it needs it.

Most of the recent issues with compatibility between running guests
and the control plane have been related to changes in oslo.context.
By putting some compatibility code into TroveContext, we should be
able to insulate the environment during upgrades.

Goal here is to reduce the chance of issues when the controller is
upgraded before the guests (which is what every operator wants
to do).

The basic idea here is to introspect the current TroveContext
including the RequestContext base class and remove any unknown
arguments coming off the wire before the constructor is called.

This patch wires NeutronTenantMtu to path_mtu instead of the deprecated
network_device_mtu. This maintains similar behavior but allows
global_physnet_mtu to be set independently. The default for this
parameter has also been changed to an empty string, allowing proper
service defaults that enable Neutron's MTU logic to be used.

This patch also sets the default for NeutronDnsmasqOptions to an empty
string and introduces handling of empty values when creating the dnsmasq
configuration file.

Note that was a Mitaka only patch. The properties were completely removed
in Newton in change I540ba5dc69d0506f71b59746efcce94c73f9317f.

When the openstackclient in Python2 passes command line arguments to a
subcommand it fails to pass the arguments as text
(e.g. Unicode). Instead it passes the arguments as binary data encoded
using the current locales encoding.

An easy way to see this is trying to pass a username with a non-ASCII
character.

% openstack user delete ñew
No user with a name or ID of 'ñew' exists.

What occurs internally is when the user data is retrieved it's it
properly represented in a Unicode object. However the username pased
from the command line is still a str object encoded in the locales
encoding (typically UTF-8). A string comparison is attempted between
the encoded data from the command line and the Unicode text found in
the user representation. This seldom ends well, either the comparison
fails to match or a codec error is raised.

There is a hard and fast rule, all text data must be stored in Unicode
objects and the conversion from binary encoded text to Unicode must
occur as close to the I/O boundary as possible. Python3 enforces this
behavior automatically but in Python2 it is the programmers job to do
so.

In the past there have been attempts to fix problems deep inside
internal code by attempting to decode from UTF-8. There are two
problems with this approach. First, internal code has no way to
accurately know what encoding was used to encode the binary data. This
is way it needs to be decoded as close to the I/O source as possible
because that is the best place to know the actual encoding. Guessing
UTF-8 is at best a heuristic. Second, there must be a canonical
representation for data ""inside"" the program, you don't want dozens of
individual modules, classes, methods, etc. performing conversions,
instead they should be able to make the assumption in what format text
is represented in, the format for text data must be Unicode. This is
another reason to decode as close to the I/O as possible.

In Python3 the argv strings are decoded from the locales encoding by
the interpreter. By the time any Python3 code sees the argv strings
they will be Unicode. However in Python2 there must be explicit code
added to decode the argv strings into Unicode.

The conversion of sys.argv into Unicode only occurs when argv is not
passed to OpenStackShell.run(). If a caller of OpenStackShell.run()
supplies their own arg it is their responsiblity to assure they are
passing actual text objects. Consider this a requirement of the API.

Note: This patch does not contain a unittest to exercise the behavior
because it is difficult to construct a test that depends on command
invocation from a shell. The general structure of the unit tests is to
pass fake argv into OpenStackShell.run() as if it came from a
shell. Because the new code only operates when argv is not passed and
defaults to sys.argv it conflicts with the unittest design.

This patch only updates the quota values for the user, who created the

Unicode must be encoded/decoded for text I/O streams, the
correct encoding for the stream must be selected and it must
be capable of handling the set of characters in the stream
or Python will raise a codec error. The correct codec is
selected based on the locale. Python2 uses the locales
encoding but only when the I/O stream is attached to a
terminal (TTY) otherwise it uses the default ASCII
encoding. The effect is internationalized text written to
the terminal works as expected but if command line output is
redirected (file or pipe) the ASCII codec is used and the
program aborts with a codec error.

The default I/O streams stdin, stdout and stderr can be
wrapped in a codec based on the locale thus assuring the
users desired encoding is always used no matter the I/O
destination. Python3 does this by default.

If the caller supplies an I/O stream we use it unmodified on
the assumption the caller has taken all responsibility for
the stream.  But with Python2 if the caller allows us to
default the I/O streams to sys.stdin, sys.stdout and
sys.stderr we apply the locales encoding just as Python3
would do. We also check to make sure the main Python program
has not already already wrapped sys.stdin, sys.stdout and
sys.stderr as this is a common recommendation.

Note, the unit test enhancement included in this patch is limited to
assuring the I/O streams passed to the App constructor are wrapped or
not wrapped as expected. No attempt is made to assure codec errors
will not occur in a terminal because of the difficulty of constructing
such a test. Properly testing this probably would require spawing a
subshell but one can't use Python's subcommand because the I/O streams
are not attached to a TTY. One could set up a ptty (pseudo-terminal)
but experience has shown ptty's to be non-portable across operating
systems and environments, getting a ptty to work correctly in all
testing environments would be more work and hassle than is justified.

Notes on backporting this commit
--------------------------------

A very similar patch exists in Liberty, (commit aa6bb0c, ""Fix default
encoding issue with python 2.6"", 7/31/2013). It was subsequently
removed in a later release (commit 12a544a0, ""Drop Python 2.6
support"", 12/30/2015).

This backport did not apply cleanly because of the similarity with
aa6bb0c as a consequence it required manual editing. I tried to retain
the best aspects of both patches (primarially in the test code).

The problem with commit aa6bb0c is it failed to recognize the codec
behavior in Python 2 differs when the output is to a terminal (TTY)
vs. another I/O sink. Commit aa6bb0c made the assumption the need to
wrap the I/O streams with a codec based on the user's locale was only
necessary in Python 2.6 and the necessity to do this was removed due
to a fix in Python 2.7. That is true, but only when the I/O sink is a
TTY, it is still necessary when the I/O sink is not a TTY and that
requirement is present in all Python 2 versions.

Therefore this backport keeps essentially the same code to wrap the
I/O stream but instead of being conditional on Python 2.6
exclusively it is now conditional on Python 2.x. The unit tests
in each patch were completely different so this backport uses all the
tests from both (albeit ported to match the current code).

Inserting an escaped line break in the link produces '-\ i' instead of the
expected '-i' and the RST rendering code produces a warning. Instead of
obsessing over line lengths in the YAML, just write the URL out fully.

Since liberty we've maintained stable branches for a number of repos that are
tied to a specific release. From Mitaka we've adopted the normal stable-branch
policy[1] and thus all branches will be maintained in accordance with this policy
from this point onwards (we can't backport anything to liberty that hasn't been
backported to mitaka, ergo all stable branches now follow the policy)

I've applied the stable:follows-policy tag to the following
repos where we maintain stable branches:

 tripleo-heat-templates
 instack-undercloud
 tripleo-common
 tripleo-puppet-elements

Post step could fail due to auth token expiration.
get_instance_nw_info fails with authentication required,
because there are several calls to neutron api, some of them
are admin context, while others try to use token from request
context. This patch ensure that if admin context is initially used,
all subsequent calls will use the same initialized client

the job is currently constanly failing due to PyMSQL not being installed

The method assertEquals has been deprecated since python 2.7.

Also in Python 3, a deprecated warning is raised when using assertEquals
therefore we should use assertEqual instead.

When you source a file that just does

you miss any invalid return codes from ""bar"" (even under -e) because
bash returns the value of the ""export"", which is 0

On centos-minimal, we stopped bringing in systemd early and this was
causing dib-init-system to not know what init was available.  Since it
did not fail correctly, it lead to confusing errors much later in the
build when service files were not copied correctly.  See also

The method _get_names_from_role_assignments is refactored to start
building up the assignment including names from a copy of the
original assignment (without names).

That way, key/value pairs that are just copied over (such as
inheritance attribute) do not need to be analyzed anymore.

When iterating over the key/value pairs of the original assignment,
it was naming them as id_type/id_. That naming could be better, as
pointed out in reviews on [1]. They have been simply renamed to
key/value.

minIOPS, maxIOPS and burstIOPS by the size of the volume.

1) Pin fast_gettext
The fast_gettext gem 1.2.0 and greater require ruby 2.1 which we don't
have.

2) Pass a generic cpu to qemu instead of trying to pass host-model

We don't need to pass any CPU extensions in the gate, given the
context where we don't use KVM or (proper) nested virtualization.
Truthfully, this also becomes required as there are upcoming changes
in qemu-kvm 2.6.0 which breaks us when trying to pass extensions
while using qemu.

Worth noting that devstack has been setting 'none' [1] as well.

Whereas the bug report associated to this fix is about
Manila UI not working, this fix addresses more than this.

On the first place, it decouples Manila UI from Manila Devstack
plugin. This is a desired change since not every Manila user
needs to work with the UI, and it doesn't make sense to have
Manila UI bits on the Manila code if we can place all Manila UI
related code on the Manila UI repo and, in this case,
Manila UI Devstack plugin. This patch-set removes all the traces
of Manila UI setup from the Manila Devstack plugin.
Manila UI Devstack plugin was added in 457249be7ab3849b3479b96077a411ca37c37a95.

And, secondly, it fixes Manila UI deploy with Devstack. Enabling
manila-ui plugin on Devstack properly sets the UI component for
Manila.

In tricircle, some files use oslo_log, while others use logging. The
oslo.log(logging) configuration library provides standardized
 configuration for all openstack projects. I think different files in
 tricircle should use a same logging module and it's better to use
 oslo_log.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
Replace logging module with oslo_log.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to realize
the solution?
No new features

1) Pin fast_gettext
The fast_gettext gem 1.2.0 and greater require ruby 2.1 which we don't

2) Pass a generic cpu to qemu instead of trying to pass host-model

We don't need to pass any CPU extensions in the gate, given the
context where we don't use KVM or (proper) nested virtualization.
Truthfully, this also becomes required as there are upcoming changes
in qemu-kvm 2.6.0 which breaks us when trying to pass extensions
while using qemu.

Worth noting that devstack has been setting 'none' [1] as well.

mkfs's arguments are

 mkfs [options] [-t type] [fs-options] device [size]

So it seems our MKFS_OPTS are really supposed to be fs-options, rather
than options to mkfs itself.

Why didn't we notice?  It's quite a trap -- mkfs.ext2 has a ""-t""
option, so when we're calling

 $ mkfs -i 4096 ... -t ext4 ...

We actually just fall-back to the default from the mkfs wrapper which
is mkfs.ext2 which works!  But when you make that, say, xfs, we're not
calling the right wrapper at all.

Also update documentation

an order of precedence. A much better way is if we are explicit about
the python we intend to be there which will allow us to make better
decisions in other elements (such as allowing for package-installs to
take into account DIB_PYTHON_VERSION) as well as allow for users to

We're seeing race failures in this test because the ip_addresses
can show up in an unexpected notification depending on when
allocate_for_instance in the neutron network API completes and
the instance.info_cache.network_info data gets stored in the
database.

We can resolve the race by using SpawnIsSynchronousFixture which
makes the allocate_for_instance network API a blocking call
until the network_info is returned, and by that time it's stored
in the instance_info_cache in the database which is where the
versioned notification pulls it from in _send_versioned_instance_update.

The nova/tests/functional/api_sample_tests/test_servers.py contains the
ServersSampleBase class, and in its class definition creates a
'user_data' attribute by base64 encoding a string. However, this will
not work in Python 3, as the base64.b64encode() method requires bytes,
not a string. As a result, importing the test class fails and no tests
get run.

Note that this change doesn't fix all tests to work under Python 3; it
simply fixes the bug that prevents the tests from running at all under
Python 3.

When starting the dhcp-agent after an upgrade, there could
be stale IPv6 addresses in the namespace that had been
configured via SLAAC.  These need to be removed, and the
same address added back statically, in order for the
agent to start up correctly.

To avoid the race condition where an IPv6 RA could arrive
while we are making this change, we must move the call
to disable RAs in the namespace from plug(), since devices
may already exist that are receiving packets.

This patch makes the git clone process idempotent.

Using asynchronous Ansible tasks to achieve the goal
also resolves a race condition seen when using the
selective git clone process with a small number of
git sources.

Ansible handles the asynchronous tasks better than
the bash job control 'wait' command.

The test to validate that a missing 'origin' remote
does not break the git clone process was removed due
to https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/19290

Consolidate last_error processing for the node-list and node-detail
views using a newly added node-error service. The service provides
a function checkNodeError that will compare the error condition
of a specified node with its last known value which is stored
in browser session persistent storage (as part of each check).
If a change in the node error condition has occurred the user
is notified using the toast service. The use of persistent storage
eliminates duplicate notifications that would otherwise be
generated from page transitions and service re-initializations.

The checkNodeError function is called whenever node information
is retrieved using the ironic service getNode/getNodes functions.

This change have introduced an issue, when the libvirt unix socket
is created after Ceilometer start. The pollster is disabled when
it should wait that libvirt come up.

The intent of the original bug was only to have a cosmetic logs
when the configuration file is wrong.

Also I don't see a safe way to disable the pollster when we can't
connect to libvirt, the reason is always unknown from Ceilometer PoV.

The script run-os-net-config[1] copies in ifcfg-* from the host before
running os-net-config. Apparently it was done this way because the
other scripts in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ differed between host
and agent container. This should be less of an issue now that host and
heat-agents run centos-7 (even when the host is atomic)

tripleo-heat-templates recently changed to running os-net-config in a
deployment script instead of an os-refresh-config script [2]. This
means that our current run-os-net-config approach is currently
resulting in os-net-config being executed twice.

Another issue with run-os-net-config is that it copies ifcfg-* from
host to container, but not back again. This means that rebooting the
server will result in unconfigured interfaces until os-net-config is
somehow run again.

This change bind mounts /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ from the host
and uses the conventional approach to running os-refresh-config.

This may fix the issue where compute nodes are losing network
connectivity, so
