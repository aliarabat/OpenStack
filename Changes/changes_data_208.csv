Step 0 is making the suffix hashes disagree, which requires the
reconstructor to come up with different suffix hashes.

The object-server calculate hashes for the non-durable frags.

The reconstructor will check against hashes for only durable frags.

Since they disagree the reconstructor will call ssync to sync the
suffix.  In the ssync sender missing_check we don't offer non-durable
fragment timestamps because the remote ssync receiver may
inappropriately mark it's non-durable frag as durable w/o anyone
verifying that timestamp is actually rebuildable!

So we punt a little further down, let the reconstructor offer it's
durable timestamp which the sender will want - and then we pull a fast
one and try to rebuild the newer non-durable fragset by passing
frag_prefs when we open the df just before reconstruct_fa!

This is a terrible kludge, only barely ""works"", throws off some basic
assumptions and incomplete.  To the extent there's any ""design"" here
it's mostly opportunistic.

The COMPUTE_STATUS_DISABLED trait is supposed to be added to the compute
RP when the compute service is disabled, and the trait supposed to be
removed when the service is enabled again. However adding and removing
traits is subject to generation conflict in placement. The original
implementation of blueprint pre-filter-disabled-computes noticed this
and prints a detailed warning message while the API operation succeeds.
We can ignore the conflict this way because the periodic
update_available_resource() call will re-sync the traits later.

Still this gives human noticeable time window where the trait and the
service state are not in sync.

Setting the compute service disable is the smaller problem as the
scheduler still uses the ComputeFilter that filters the computes based
on the service api. So during the enable ->disable race window we only
lose scheduling performance as the placement filter is inefficient.

In case of setting the compute service to enabled the race is more
visible as the placement pre_filter will filter out the compute that
is enable by the admin until the re-sync happens. If the de-sync would
only happen due to high load on the given compute the such delay could
be explained by the load itself. However de-sync can happen simply due
to a new instance boot on the compute.

This patch adds a functional test that reproduce the original problem.

When an instance has VERIFY_RESIZE status, the instance disk on the
source compute host has moved to <instance_path>/<instance_uuid>_resize
folder, which leads to disk not found errors if the update available
resource periodic task on the source compute runs before resize is
actually confirmed.

Icec2769bf42455853cbe686fb30fda73df791b25 almost fixed this issue but it
will only set reraise to False when task_state is not None, that isn't
the case when an instance is resized but resize is not yet confirmed.
This patch adds a condition based on vm_state to ensure we don't
reraise DiskNotFound exceptions while resize is not confirmed.

This patch introduces ExecStopPost configuration into systemd unit

Because ``service`` commands are deprecated in favor of

command succeeds in the NFS helper used by e.g. the
lvm and generic back ends fails.  The string sought to

Update the helper to use ``systemctl`` commands instead

Policy checks are skipped when looking up a share-type
by name.  This causes share creation attempts that specify
a valid share-type to pass the early API check on share type
even if the share type named is private and not shared with
the user's project.  The share creation fails later, but after
the database record for the share is created.  Although the
operation fails with an ERROR, the share is stuck in CREATING
state.

Fix this issue by checking the user's project in the database
API just as we do for share type lookups by uuid.

NOTE(elod.illes): This is a combination of 2 commits: the cherry-pick
hash checker script and a fix for the script.

1. Check cherry-pick hashes in pep8 tox target

This adds a tools/ script that checks any cherry-picked hashes
on the current commit (or a provided commit) to make sure that
all the hashes exist on at least master or stable/.* branches.
This should help avoid accidentally merging stable backports
where one of the hashes along the line has changed due to conflicts.

2. Fix cherry-pick check for merge patch

Cherry-pick check script validates the proposed patch's commit message.
If a patch is not on top of the given branch then Zuul rebases it to
the top and the patch becomes a merge patch. In this case the script
validates the merge patch's commit message instead of the original
patch's commit message and fails.

This fix selects the parent of the patch if it is a merge patch.

From now, limit_hosts will take precedence over the blacklisted_hostnames.
And therefore Ansible won't be run with two --limit if both limit hosts
and blacklisted hostnames are in use. When we want to run Ansible on
specific hosts, we will ignore the blacklisted nodes and assume we know
what we do. In the case of the scale-down scenario, the unreachable nodes
are ignored.

Note: adding unit tests coverage for both parameters.
Note-bis: unit tests aren't clean backport on train, since Ansible CLI
wasn't exactly the same.

Don't use timestamp when generating ec2 signed url for alarm url

This will resolve the issue for new resources even if they are cached

However, for existing stacks containing these resources the current
best option is to not cache these attributes and allow alarm resources
to be able to get a new never expiring urls in the next forced update.

This squash allows to backport a feature without a regression that was
introduced. It has 2 commits:

1) overcloud_deploy: raise at the end if Ansible Runner had exception

In the context of MaxFailPercentage, if a node (e.g. one of 100
computes) has any fatal error during an Ansible play and we tolerate
some percentage of failure; we want to raise the error but at the very
end of the deployment.

So this patch puts the following actions in a ""finally"" block so they
always execute:

* Create overcloudrc
* Sets the right permissions to the clouds.yaml
* Execute _deploy_postconfig
* Print infos like Keystone entpoint, Horizon URL, RC file location
  and deploy message (saying if there is an error or not)

And at the very end we raise the actual AnsibleRunner trace if the
deployment failed.

So even if a node failed and we tolerate it, we'll still finish the
deployment until the end, but for UX purpose we want to raise it at the
very end.
Note that when it fails and it's tolerated, Ansible prints the node as
""ignored"":

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************
compute-0    : ok=555  (...)  failed=0    skipped=484  rescued=0    ignored=0
compute-1    : ok=60   (...)  failed=1    skipped=40   rescued=0    ignored=1
controller-0 : ok=960  (...)  failed=0    skipped=709  rescued=0    ignored=0
controller-1 : ok=920  (...)  failed=0    skipped=693  rescued=0    ignored=0
controller-2 : ok=919  (...)  failed=0    skipped=693  rescued=0    ignored=0
undercloud   : ok=86   (...)  failed=0    skipped=57   rescued=0    ignored=0

To improve UX, we'll investigate an Ansible callback to properly tell
what nodes needs to be re-deployed.

Note: also mock copy_clouds_yaml since it wasn't tested before but it's
failing to reach the files on the filesystem.

A new BarbicanClient tripleo service provides a means of configuring
the barbican Key Manager settings for cinder, glance and nova services
running at an edge site. This is necessary because the BarbicanApi
tripleo service is only capable of configuring the Key Manager settings
for services running in the control plane.

For cinder, the BarbicanClient ensures the KeyManager settings are
available to the cinder-volume and cinder-backup services. This is
necessary because the Key Manager setttings are traditionally associated
with the cinder-api service, but cinder-api is not deployed at the edge.

Since this bind-mount isn't shared with any other container, remove its

This relabelling is especially useless since the directory creation AND
openstack-selinux sets its type to a sensible value. We can therefore
remove it and prevent possible issues in the future.

Add test to ensure that logical router port associated

needed: test_logical_router_port_creation. With that,
the test exercises the code-path where a gateway is
removed before a new one is set. In terms of OpenStack
workflow, that would look like:

  openstack router set --external-gateway $EXT_NET_ID $RTR
  openstack router unset --external-gateway $RTR

Fixing vbmc_setup.yaml for c8 scenario012-standalone job with this
patch.

vbmc_setup.yaml was originally written for c7 multinode[0] to install
virtual BMC and a libvirt domain on the controller for ironic to
manage. In scenario012 we are trying to test something close to ironic
in overcloud(Blueprint[1]).

In the past, We have moved scenario012 mutinode to standalone job and
reused vbmc_setup.yaml.

The shell script in vbmc_setup.yaml need following modification as its
now a C8 standalone job:-

* Added 'set -e' so that script exits immediately if a command exits
with a non-zero status so it would result in deployment failure.
Currently deployment is passing even if some commands in the bash
script are failing. Addition of 'set -e' will correct this behavior.
* Replaced yum with dnf as yum not present in Centos8.
* No need to override resolv.conf entry as standalone job already
configure necessary nameserver entries.
* No need to install additional repos as as standalone job already
configure necessary repos.
* When vbmc_setup.yaml was introduced intention was to do non-kvm
emulation[2] and that was the reason qemu-system-x86 and qemu-kvm-ev
was pulled from epel, but for c8 these packages are no longer available
in repos [3] including epel. We can use qemu-kvm package instead and
we will no longer need epel repos.
* create-node.sh command option to use qemu-system have to be removed
as qemu-system-x86 package is missing and we are using qemu-kvm
instead.
* Temporary workaround[4] to upgrade ansible in the neutron container
can be removed as ansible version in container is now v2.5.8+.
Test patch for tripleo-ci-centos-8-scenario012-standalone is here[5].

Policy checks are skipped when looking up a share-type
by name.  This causes share creation attempts that specify
a valid share-type to pass the early API check on share type
even if the share type named is private and not shared with
the user's project.  The share creation fails later, but after
the database record for the share is created.  Although the
operation fails with an ERROR, the share is stuck in CREATING
state.

Fix this issue by checking the user's project in the database
API just as we do for share type lookups by uuid.

This patch addresses the scenario where an
incremental backup can be created having a
parent backup that was taken in a different
project. This scenario ultimately leads to
a silent error when creating/deleting the
incremental backup and quotas going out of
sync.

The proposed fix is to narrow the backup search
down to the same project. To achieve this, a
method's signature had to be updated to achieve
the desired optimized behavior of passing the
volume's project_id parameter.

During Pike cycle there was efforts to deploy services under
Apache HTTPD. It became clear very quickly that Glance did not
operate properly when deployed as bare wsgi app under web
server but admin documentation was merged that indicated that
being somehow the preferred method. It was added to the doc
that in Pike release there was issues in these models.

There was never interest nor resources to fix the underlying
issues but the doc stayed in place indicating that those
issues could be only Pike related when they in matter of
fact has got even worse over the time. Due to the fact that
Glance is even more relying on eventlet than back then it's
time to clarify the docs and make clear it's not adviced
deployment model, it won't work and there is no itention
to change that.

Glance should not be exposing import methods that cannot work via its
API, but it does today. In order for tempest (et al) to be able to
properly detect whether import is possible, we must configure the
import methods in standalone mode, or disable them in wsgi mode. The
referenced Glance patch will make this a requirement.

The Kaminario driver used to accept the unique_fqdn_network
configuration option in the specific driver section, but when we moved
this option to be an option also used by 3PAR we introduced a regression
where the parameter was now only used if it was defined in the shared
configuration group.

This patch fixes this and makes it possible for the option to be defined
in the shared configuration group as well as the driver specific

redis(non-pcmk), nova-scheduler and swift-proxy do not need /run bind
mounted from the host.  As a matter of fact bind-mounting /run is
problematic due to a number of reasons (see LP#1883849 for more
background). In particular swift-proxy is the only swift container
(out of 9) that has /run bind-mounted.

These three services always had /run from the very beginning:
- redis -> Ie750caa34c6fa22ca6eae6834b9ca20e15d97f7f
- nova-scheduler -> I39436783409ed752b08619b07b0a0c592bce0456
- swift-proxy -> I2d96514fb7aa51dffe8fe293bc950e0e99df5e94

Tested this by applying this patch on a train deployment and
deployed an undercloud and an overcloud with it.
Verified that:
A) /run:/run is not present in the three containers
B) Deploy of UC and OC worked correctly
C) Tempest still works
D) Restarting the swift_proxy and nova_scheduler works correctly
E) Reboot the overcloud worked okay and tempest still works after the
   full overcloud reboot
F) Ran a minor UC update
G) Ran a minor update on all nodes and tempest still worked
H) Ran a redeploy on all nodes and tempest still worked

NB: I did not investigate other containers that bind mount /run
because they 1) seem to need it and 2) had no means to do proper
testing.

NB2: Note that while once we rebuild containers with
I81e5b7abf4571fece13a029e25911e9e4dece673 this change here is not
strictly needed for the LP bug, but is a nice cleanup nonetheless.
So this is to be backported only if rebuilding containers is
a problematic/costly move

WARNING - tests aren't quite ready, and this is fairly old (2017).  I
still think the changes are valid, but the tests still need some work.

charms.reactive is slightly 'odd' feature that ANY handler can run
during any hook.  The handlers in aodh didn't have guards which meant
that various setup actions that occured on relation connections ran on
every hook thereafter, including update-status.  This led to undesirable
behaviour such as (probably) restarting the services every 5 minutes.

This patch changes that by adding guard states so that configuration is
only performed once, but can be performed again if an interface
disconnects and reconnects.  It DOESN'T track if the data on an
interface changes, but for the interfaces used, this shouldn't be an
issue.

It also takes advantage of some changes to charms.openstack to support
centralised mocking for test cases.

that in Pike release there was issues in these models.

There was never interest nor resources to fix the underlying

issues could be only Pike related when they in matter of

This change installs python3 on a dib7 base image to allow dib
to build images on older branches and distros like CentOS7/RHEL7
with Python3 and also using the latest code of DIB.

diskimage_builder/elements/dib-python/pre-install.d/01-dib-python
runs 'command -v python3' and fails because CentOS7 cloud base
image does not have python3 installed.

Also, python3-pyyaml is not available as package, then we install
it with pip to meet package requirements..

This change also includes a small fix on the error handling for
'command -v' by letting the script to continue its execution and
echo the error msg.

Use case: A compute node has been removed, so any host_alive

the time of removal the list of target_hostnames to match are
not known.

Update/Upgrade commands have now a prompt by default that ask for
confirmation before proceeding. It'll prevent an user to run the
command that may cause the problems to infrastructure.
This prompt can be skipped with --yes/-y argument.

Note: putting ""UPDATE"" and ""UPGRADE"" in uppercase to make sure this is
visible and clear. We have seen many users running the wrong command and
ending up doing an upgrade instead of an update.

Note2: this prompt will be ported to the upgrade and FFWD workflows to
prevent unexpected execution to prevent potential harm to
infrastructures.

This patch is a part of switching ovn as a default in devstack

The guide needs a reference location. It was removed from
opendev/infra-manual via https://review.opendev.org/711325.
This change adds a bit of introduction and and imports
the last version of the guide almost unchanged:
- minimal changes to few then-internal references, now external;
- a few formatting fixes (long lines, broken links, etc).

This is a squashed version of zuulv3.rst which comes from

In Python 3.3+, 'sys.platform' no longer includes a major version [1]:

  issue 12326: On Linux, sys.platform doesn't contain the major version
  anymore. It is now always 'linux', instead of 'linux2' or 'linux3'
  depending on the Linux version used to build Python. Replace
  sys.platform == 'linux2' with sys.platform.startswith('linux'), or
  directly sys.platform == 'linux' if you don't need to support older
  Python versions.

Since we only care about Python 3.6 or greater, we could simply check
for 'linux'. However, the libvirt driver isn't supported on non-Linux
hosts so this was always a dumb check. Simply remove it instead.

The Kaminario driver used to accept the unique_fqdn_network
configuration option in the specific driver section, but when we moved
this option to be an option also used by 3PAR we introduced a regression
where the parameter was now only used if it was defined in the shared
configuration group.

This patch fixes this and makes it possible for the option to be defined
in the shared configuration group as well as the driver specific
section.

Rax hosts uses qemu software emulated VMs without leveraging the
magic with-in the processors to help ensure speedy execution.

As such, they can be substantially slower in some operations, such
decompressing ramdisks. This adds an unpredictable element into our
CI and causes job failures when they should ahve succeeded, which
causes more rechecks, which consumes more resources... and the cycle
continues.

So instead, we'll extend the timeout a little, to hopefully give the
job time to complete without causing failures.

This patch refactors the failover flows to improve the performance
and reliability of failovers in Octavia.

Specific improvements are:
* More tasks and flows will retry when other OpenStack services are
  failing.
* Failover can now succeed even when all of the amphora are missing
  for a given load balancer.
* It will check and repair the load balancer VIP should the VIP
  port(s) become corrupted in neutron.
* It will cleanup extra resources that may be associated with a
  load balancer in the event of a cloud service failure.

This patch also removes some dead code.

For the cases where we can change IP version type compares,
we change them with this change.

Note: other uses of netutils still exist, and we should
eventually see if we can phase them out, however the remaining
uses are around MAC address validations.

Add a new ``[ipmi]use_ipmitool_retries`` option. When set to
``True`` and timing is supported by ipmitool, the number of
retries and command interval will be passed to ipmitool so
that ipmitool will do the retries.  When set to ``False``,
ironic will do the retries.

The default is ``True``, so this will not change the current
behaviour which is to have ipmitool do the retries when
timing is supported.

Setting to ``False`` will help with certain BMCs which do
not support the Cipher Suites command.  In this case ipmitool
can take up to 10 seconds for each retry which results in a
total time exceeding ``[ipmi]command_retry_timeout``.

This patch intends to make the transition of the OVN DevStack module
easier by allowing both copies of it to exist at the same time, the one
in Neutron repository and the one in the DevStack repository [0].

1) Make create_public_bridge idempotent

If we call this function more than once the second call and on will fail
with the following error:

2020-07-13 09:12:53.885633 | controller | ++
/opt/stack/neutron/devstack/lib/ovn_agent:create_public_bridge:263 :
sudo ip addr add 172.24.5.1/24 dev br-ex
2020-07-13 09:12:53.894247 | controller | RTNETLINK answers: File exists

During the transiton of moving the OVN DevStack from the Neutron
repository to the DevStack repository [0] this method is being invoked
twice in the ovn job in the DevStack gate because it will be cause as
part of the plugin being enabled and the normal code execution.

This patch makes the method idempotent by calling ""addr replace"" instead
of ""addr add"" to avoid the ""RTNETLINK answers: File exists"" error.

2) Move the setup of the tcpdump on br-ex to ""extra"" to it can start
after the create_public_bridge is called.

Method _ensure_default_security_group wasn't atomic as it first tries to get
default SG and if that not exists in DB, it tries to create it.

It may happend, like e.g. in Calico plugin that between
get_default_sg_id method and create_security_group method, this default
SG will be created by other neutron worker. And in such case there will
be Duplicate entry exception raised.

So this patch is adding handling of such exception.

We temporarily disabled scenario tests in
the voting LVM job [1] because of a bug
in which a kernel problem caused a reboot
in the middle of the job when it ran in a
Xen virtualization environment on rax nodes.

The kernel has been updated on those nodes
and the problem has gone away, as evidenced
in various checks jobs in this review, so
let's reenable the scenario tests.

Bug #1886668 has now been addressed in ubuntu, and
the new kernel no longer suffers from the problem
that led to mid-test reboots like the previous ones
did. So we can safely re-enable scenario tests in the
gating LVM job.

For all the tasks in common/deploy-steps-playbooks-common.yaml:

* any_errors_fatal will be set to False for all tasks as this is
  shared with the scale tasks or where nodes may not be available.
  Due to https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70663 this cannot
  be set dynamically at this time. If an error occurs it'll get picked
  up by a future task.

* Add ignore_unreachable to all the tasks which didn't have it before
  (and set it to scale_ignore_unreachable | default(false))

This will allow a scale-down to work fine when a node that is being
scaled down is unreachable.

In the last PTG the Neutron team discussed and decided to undeprecate
the neutron-legacy module in DevStack because that's the module being
used (almost) everywhere and it works. The lib/neutron was an attempt
to refactor the old module but, in the last few years it hasn't gained
any traction and due to the lack of features and people to work on it,
it's going to be removed from DevStack eventually.

Below is a snippet from the PTG summary email [0] about this topic:

<snippet>
In Devstack there are currently 2 modules which can configure
Neutron. Old one called ""lib/neutron-legacy"" and the new one called
""lib/neutron"". It is like that since many cycles that ""lib/neutron-legacy""
is deprecated. But it is still used everywhwere. New module isn't still
finished and isn't working fine.  This is very confusing for users as
really maintained and recommended is still ""lib/neutron-legacy"" module.

During the discussion Sean Collins explained us that originally this
new module was created as an attempt to refactor old module, and to
make Neutron in the Devstack better to maintain. But now we see that
this process failed as new module isn't still used and we don't have
any cycles to work on it. So our final conclusion is to ""undeprecate""
old ""lib/neutron-legacy"" and get rid of the new module.
</snippet>

This patch changes the Ironic jobs to use the old Neutron module in
DevStack.

Glance has a facility lazy loading for legacy images which will be called
on get/list api calls to add store information in image's location metadata
based on location URL of image. Even if admin decides to change the store
names in glance-api.conf same will also be updated in location metadata
for all images related to that particular store. Current implementation of
legacy image performs this operation on each get/list call as location metadata
is not getting updated in database or it doesn't handle to perform store name
check in glance-api.conf.

Improvements done:
1. Save updated location metadata information in database permenantly
2. Add logic to perform lazy loading only if store information is not present
in location metadata or store present in location metadata is not defined in
glance's enbaled_backends configuration option.

Update/Upgrade commands have now a prompt by default that ask for

command that may cause the problems to infrastructure.
This prompt can be skipped with --yes/-y argument.

Note: putting ""UPDATE"" and ""UPGRADE"" in uppercase to make sure this is
visible and clear. We have seen many users running the wrong command and
ending up doing an upgrade instead of an update.

Note2: this prompt will be ported to the upgrade and FFWD workflows to
prevent unexpected execution to prevent potential harm to

NOTE(elod.illes): This is a combination of 2 commits: the cherry-pick
hash checker script and a fix for the script.

1. Check cherry-pick hashes in pep8 tox target

This adds a tools/ script that checks any cherry-picked hashes
on the current commit (or a provided commit) to make sure that
all the hashes exist on at least master or stable/.* branches.
This should help avoid accidentally merging stable backports
where one of the hashes along the line has changed due to conflicts.

2. Fix cherry-pick check for merge patch

Cherry-pick check script validates the proposed patch's commit message.
If a patch is not on top of the given branch then Zuul rebases it to
the top and the patch becomes a merge patch. In this case the script
validates the merge patch's commit message instead of the original
patch's commit message and fails.

This fix selects the parent of the patch if it is a merge patch.

The tripleo_free strategy should allow the tasks to run freely for a
given playbook that defines using the tripleo_free strategy. The defaul
strategy is a linear one that will execute each task across all servers
prior to moving to the next task. The tripleo_free strategy will execute
the tasks on servers without syncryonizing the tasks within a given
playbook. Because TripleO uses step concepts in our deployment, we
already have the syncronization points in the main playbook. The outer
playbook should be done linearly but the deployment steps themselves
should be done freely.

The tripleo_free playbook won't stop execution on all hosts if one host
fails or becomes unreachable. It will however end the play exeuction if
any error occurs on any host. This is similar to the deployment failures
we used to have with Heat where a failure on any single node would stop
the deployment at a given deployment step.  A future improvement of this
will be to add logic to handle a failure percentage on a given TripleO
role to only stop the playbook if the failure percentage exceeds a
defined amount. Currently any failure will stop a playbook but may not
stop later tasks from executing on the rest of the hosts. We will likely
need to implement a tripleo_linear strategy based on the upstream linear
strategy to understand these failure percentages as well.

NOTE: During the testing of this, we identified two issues with the free
strategy in ansible itself. We will need those fixes landed in the
version of ansible prior to being able to land this.

For all the tasks in common/deploy-steps-playbooks-common.yaml:

* any_errors_fatal will be set to False for all tasks as this is
  shared with the scale tasks or where nodes may not be available.
  Due to https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70663 this cannot
  be set dynamically at this time. If an error occurs it'll get picked
  up by a future task.

* Add ignore_unreachable to all the tasks which didn't have it before
  (and set it to scale_ignore_unreachable | default(false))

This will allow a scale-down to work fine when a node that is being
scaled down is unreachable.

Update the image upload command for kernels/ramdisks so partition
image based CI integration testing jobs, like those used by ironic,
are not failing due to only the partition image being uploaded without
a kernel and ramdisk, which causes code interpreting the image to
believe that the image is infact a whole-disk-image.

This is needed as a result of change:
https://review.opendev.org/#/c/735966

+ functions:upload_image:427 : '[' -n /opt/stack/devstack/files/images/cirros-0.5.1-x86_64-uec/cirros-0.5.1-x86_64-initrd ']'
++ functions:upload_image:428 : oscwrap --os-cloud=devstack-admin --os-region-name=RegionOne image create cirros-0.5.1-x86_64-uec-ramdisk hw_rng_model=virtio --public --container-format ari --disk-format ari

Where previously ""--property"" was prepended to the properties set,
however for partition images, it doesn't make sense to support
explicit property setting as the kernel and ramdisk id values are
linked to by the primary glance image object once uploaded.

The majority of ironic's CI is built upon devstack, and thus some changes
which may pass setting up a stock devstack, may still ultimately cripple
Ironic's CI. Mainly in terms of integration with other projects.

As such, it seems logical to make the CI job voting such that breaking
changes have visibility upfront.

Also re-names the job name to the more modern name as the
driver name the job mentions was explicitly removed some time
ago in favor of what is called driver composition.

This change came out of a discussion of Neutron changing the default to
OVN. Which while problematic for Ironic due to a lack of necessary DHCP
server capabilities, the topic of the neturon-legacy/neutron plugin came
up and Ironic, and at the time of this change Ironic uses the ""neutron""
plugin. As such, abrupt removal of the plugin would be a fairly
catastropic change for Ironic, hence the need for cross-gating.

Follow the same pattern of the other jobs which deploy devstack
but runs also functional tests (see devtack-tox-functional
and devstack-tox-functional-consumer).

Without this, the older branches where cinderlib functional tests
use Python 2 (stein, and soon train when that is branched) fails
because they try to install packages part of which are Python 3
only.

The same change was applied to the branchless jobs defined
inside cinder-tempest-plugins: https://review.opendev.org/738078/

We added an integration gate job a couple of

tests that check whether manila-ui is working.

Previously (when python 2 was supported) we introduced some specific
exception management to detect connections issues when a rabbitmq
cluster node disappearing.

The original issue was that a ConnectionRefusedError is thrown and not
managed by oslo.messaging to detect heartbeat issue and call ensure_connection
for switching the connection destination (cluster node).

`ConnectionRefusedError` is only a python 3 exception [2].

Now that we only support python 3 we don't need to continue to
wrap/emulate this kind of exceptions (ConnectionRefusedError) [2] and
so we can drop the python 2 compatibility code to only support python 3 code.

This is actually two functions, one of which takes an XML string and
another than takes an existing domain. Neither return a domain but
rather a Guest object, and while the first actually creates a new domain
along with the new Guest, the latter simply creates the new Guest and
resumes the existing domain. Simplify the function by ensuring it only
focuses on the former case, creation of new domains as part of the new
Guest object. The revised function is renamed, along with a related
function, '_create_domain_and_network', to reflect what it actually
returns. The other cases are replaced by simple call to
'Guest.resume()', which is all the latter case was really doing.

While we're here, we also update the function signature of the later to
make the 'block_device_info' argument mandatory, since all callers were
passing this anyway. All of this has some test impact but nothing
serious.

We also move some of the tests from 'test_driver' to 'test_guest', since
they were actually testing things from 'virt.libvirt.guest' but clearly
just weren't moved when that module was introduced many cycles ago.

Finally, we rename the '_prepare_domain_for_snapshot' and
'_snapshot_domain' functions to reflect what they're actually doing,
namely suspending and then resuming the domain before and after a
(cold) snapshot, respectively.

The common role was previously added as a dependency to all other roles.
It would set a fact after running on a host to avoid running twice. This
had the nice effect that deploying any service would automatically pull
in the common services for that host. When using tags, any services with
matching tags would also run the common role. This could be both
surprising and sometimes useful.

When using Ansible at large scale, there is a penalty associated with
executing a task against a large number of hosts, even if it is skipped.
The common role introduces some overhead, just in determining that it
has already run.

This change extracts the common role into a separate play, and removes
the dependency on it from all other roles. New groups have been added
for cron, fluentd, and kolla-toolbox, similar to other services. This
changes the behaviour in the following ways:

* The common role is now run for all hosts at the beginning, rather than
  prior to their first enabled service
* Hosts must be in the necessary group for each of the common services
  in order to have that service deployed. This is mostly to avoid
  deploying on localhost or the deployment host
* If tags are specified for another service e.g. nova, the common role
  will *not* automatically run for matching hosts. The common tag must
  be specified explicitly

The last of these is probably the largest behaviour change. While it
would be possible to determine which hosts should automatically run the
common role, it would be quite complex, and would introduce some
overhead that would probably negate the benefit of splitting out the
common role.

When calculating the device tagging metadata for PFs, we need to get
the PCI device's MAC address in order to find its associated VIF.
Previously, this was done by calling
pci_utils.get_mac_by_pci_address() and passing pf_interface=True. This
was incorrect. It caused _get_sysfs_netdev_path() to return a
nonexistent sysfs path to get_ifname_by_pci_address(). The latter's
os.listdir() call then raised an Exception. This was caught and
bubbled up as a PciDeviceNotFoundById exception. This caused
_build_hostdev_metadata() in the libvirt driver to skip that
interface's metadata.

pf_interface=True is used when passing a VF's PCI address in order to
request the PCI address of its parent PF. As this is not what
_build_hostdev_metadata() needs, this patch stops doing that.

In the case of PFs using VFIO-PCI (as opposed to a regular networking
kernel driver), PciDeviceNotFoundById is expected to be raised, as
those devices have no associated netdev. Instead of the previous
debug-level generic notice, this patch promotes the log message to a
warning explaining that device tagging does not work with VFIO-PCI
devices.

This patch (in charms.ceph [1], copied here) add the concept of a
watchdog to the upgrade_monitor so that the charm can achieve two
objectives of 1. Waiting for much longer, but 2. detecting whether the
previous node has died / gone away.  This is needed for 'large' OSDs
where the time to upgrade a node may exceed the current limit of 10
minutes, but also not to wait for 30 minutes on a dead previous node.
The watchdog implements two timeouts and an addition 'alive' key from
the previous node to indicate that it is still running.  Otherwise,
functionality is identical.

The Ceph cluster needs not to mark down OSDs during the time when
the nodes are undercloud LEAPP upgrade because during that step
nodes will be rebooted.

This change implements setting and unsetting of the Ceph flags
(noout, norebalance, norecover and nobackfill) required to avoid
marking the OSDs down: the involved tasks are executed before node
(each) starts the LEAPP process and after the upgrade is finished and
the node rebooted.

This patch is going directly into train because it's trying to address
a problem that depends on the queens/train FFWD upgrade, while in
the main branch the upgrade_tasks list is still empty.

This patch add the concept of a watchdog to the upgrade_monitor so that
the charm can achieve two objectives of 1. Waiting for much longer, but
2. detecting whether the previous node has died / gone away.  This is
needed for 'large' OSDs where the time to upgrade a node may exceed the
current limit of 10 minutes, but also not to wait for 30 minutes on a
dead previous node.  The watchdog implements two timeouts and an
addition 'alive' key from the previous node to indicate that it is still
running.  Otherwise, functionality is identical.

In order to facilitate writing and running tempest tests for these features
in all environments covered by the various jobs across all the projects that
include Glance, we should default to this deployment method.

It is still possible to deploy glance in uwsgi mode by setting the flag to

work. However, the default should be what we expect deployers will use,

When evacuating an instance between compute hosts on shared storage,
during the rebuild operation we call spawn() on the destination
compute. spawn() currently assumes that it should cleanup all
resources on failure, which results in user data being deleted in the
evacuate case.

This change modifies spawn in the libvirt driver such that it only
cleans up resources it created.

Block traffic between br-int and br-physical is over kill
and will at least

1. interrupt vlan flow during startup, and is particularly
so if dvr enabled
2. if let's rabbitmq is not stable, it is possible data plane
will be affected and vlan will never work.

Using openstack on k8s particularly amplifies the problem
because pod could be killed pretty easily by liveness
probes.

When no tag is set for an entry in ContainerImagePrepare, the default
tag from container-images/container_image_prepare_defaults.yaml will be
assumed, which is typically current-tripleo, or a release version such
as 16.0.

In most cases, this tag will exist. However, when using a satellite with
a content view that has been filtered on tags, it likely won't exist
since content views are often used with container image versions that
are not the latest.

In the case where no tag is set in the entry in ContainerImagePrepare,
and the default tag does not exist in the container repo, the latest tag
from the repo will be assumed instead.

In the last PTG the Neutron team discussed and decided to undeprecate
the neutron-legacy module in DevStack because that's the module being
used (almost) everywhere and it works. The lib/neutron was an attempt
to refactor the old module but, in the last few years it hasn't gained
any traction and due to the lack of features and people to work on it,
it's going to be removed from DevStack eventually.

Below is a snippet from the PTG summary email [0] about this topic:

<snippet>
In Devstack there are currently 2 modules which can configure
Neutron. Old one called ""lib/neutron-legacy"" and the new one called
""lib/neutron"". It is like that since many cycles that
""lib/neutron-legacy""
is deprecated. But it is still used everywhwere. New module isn't still
finished and isn't working fine.  This is very confusing for users as
really maintained and recommended is still ""lib/neutron-legacy"" module.

During the discussion Sean Collins explained us that originally this
new module was created as an attempt to refactor old module, and to
make Neutron in the Devstack better to maintain. But now we see that
this process failed as new module isn't still used and we don't have
any cycles to work on it. So our final conclusion is to ""undeprecate""
old ""lib/neutron-legacy"" and get rid of the new module.
</snippet>

This patch changes the Metalsmith jobs to use the old Neutron module in
DevStack.

This change is a proof-of-concept for enabling floating IP's on routed
networks. To be able to create a subnet that spans all segments of a
routed network, a special subnet service type of 'network:routed' is
used to denote a network that can span all segments of a routed network.
To create floating IP's on a routed network, the subnet must be created
with a service_type of 'network:routed'. After the subnet has been
created, floating IP's can be allocated and associated as before.
See the design spec https://review.opendev.org/#/c/486450/ for
reference.

One caveat for this approach is that it requires the underlying
infrastructure to be aware of and able to route /32 host routes
for the floating IP. This implies that in practice, use of the
'network:routed' service type should be done in conjunction with
one or both of the following:

1. Third-party SDN backend that handles this service type in its
   own way
2. neutron-dynamic-routing and the BGP service plugin for announcing
   the appropriate next-hops for floating IP's. This is compatible
   with DVR and non-DVR environments.

finished and isn't working fine.  This is very confusing for users as
really maintained and recommended is still ""lib/neutron-legacy"" module.

During the discussion Sean Collins explained us that originally this
new module was created as an attempt to refactor old module, and to
make Neutron in the Devstack better to maintain. But now we see that
this process failed as new module isn't still used and we don't have
any cycles to work on it. So our final conclusion is to ""undeprecate""
old ""lib/neutron-legacy"" and get rid of the new module.
</snippet>

This patch changes the ironic-prometheus-exporter jobs to use the old
Neutron module in DevStack.

Block traffic between br-int and br-physical is over kill
and will at least

1. interrupt vlan flow during startup, and is particularly
so if dvr enabled
2. if let's rabbitmq is not stable, it is possible data plane
will be affected and vlan will never work.

Using openstack on k8s particularly amplifies the problem
because pod could be killed pretty easily by liveness
probes.

A bit like we did for I3e0e86026f5a4a78473bed824cd1682d3a020cd5 we
should remove the nss-systemd lookup from containers. The reasons for
this are as follows:
1) Just like for I3e0e86026f5a4a78473bed824cd1682d3a020cd5
when this nss module is triggered it tries to talk to dbus.
It triggers a bunch of selinux denials and it makes little sense
to open all containers to talk to dbus.
In particular, if a container is run as non-privileged and bind-mounts
/run from the host, we will hit selinux denials like the following:

  type=USER_AVC msg=audit(1592337775.860:74119): pid=1284 uid=81 auid=4294967295 ses=4294967295 subj=system_u:system_r:system_dbusd_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 msg='avc:  denied  { send_msg } for msgtype=method_call interface=org.freedesktop.DBus member=Hello dest=org.freedesktop.DBus spid=406228 scontext=system_u:system_r:container_t:s0:c162,c886 tcontext=system_u:system_r:system_dbusd_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 tclass=dbus permissive=0  exe=""/usr/bin/dbus-daemon"" sauid=81 hostname=? addr=? terminal=?'UID=""dbus"" AUID=""unset"" SAUID=""dbus""

2) It just makes little sense in a kolla-world to have containers
talk to dbus/systemd and it saves us some time when a lookup triggers
the systemd module for whatever reason. Especially because the
nss-systemd module does a few things which are not useful in a container
(ensures that the root and nobody users and groups remain resolvable,
SystemD's DynamicUser= feature, provide Lookup API via Varlink)

The sed regex gives us the wanted results:
