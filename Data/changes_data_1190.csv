To support in-tree functional api testing, the test class common
across all types of testing can't import modules that define
configuration that Tempest also defines because duplicate
configuration definitions result in runtime errors.  A previous change
(I44251db399cd73390a9d1931a7f253662002ba10) moved conflicting imports
to a separate module, but subsequent additions have added new conflicting
imports.

This change creates a new test class that is safe to use for all types
of testing (neutron.tests.sub_base.SubBaseTestCase), ensures that the
existing existing base test class (neutron.tests.base.BaseTestCase)
extends it, and documents their respective responsibilities.  This
will hopefully make it less likely that the functional api job will be
broken by changes to the base test class.

The library testing jobs aren't really about testing the libraries,
they are about sniff testing them in a live deploy. By only using the
neutron jobs we are effectively testing the entirety of the integrated
release, minus a *very* small amount of code in nova.

This will reduce the amount of random fail on these jobs, use a lot
less nodes, and achieve effectively the same results. Any n-net only
breaks that slip through should be addressed by other mechanisms,
because the likelyhood that n-net is so dramatically using libraries
differently from the rest of nova is vanishlying small.

Mock has a method called assert_called_once_with to check that a mock
was called and the arguments it took were as expected. Mock does not
have a method called assert_called_once and calling it just creates a
mock bound to that name. This means that not only is nothing tested
when assert_called_once is used, the tests also don't warn about this.

This commit attempts to address this in two ways:
    - all occurrences of assert_called_once are replaced with a real
      assertion.
    - the hacking check that nova uses to guard against this has been
      copied to cinder's local hacking checks.

Fixing the assert_called_once issues also highlighted other mistakes
in certain tests which were addressed to make the tests pass.

Due to the nature of mock, this issue is also possible if a method is
misspelt or just mistakenly used and so the hacking check is only
addressing one very specific case. That said, it does appear to be a
common mistake and so is worth singling out.

It can be difficult to figure out what to install to get a test
environment that can be used to test all the opportunistic tests,
zookeeper and mysql (with the right user and password and test
database).

This script provides a way to do this on rhel/ubuntu based
environments and can be used to examine how to do this for other
environment types.

I use it with nova boot (on rhel images) and it has worked out
great as a way to rebuild a clean test environment as I need.

While running unit tests I noticed that all of the test cases from
TestOvsNeutronAgent were taking just over 15 seconds.  This is because
it was waiting for the rpc call response timeout.  Since the tests
weren't actually failing, it's clear the code doesn't actually care
about the response anyway, so just set the messaging config to not
wait for the response.

On my dev box, this dropped test runtime for this file from 1024
seconds to 3 seconds, which is an obvious *HUGE* improvement.

Someone pointed out that an earlier change
(086496bfc45e01cd2905a074d526a7d513bf4ec2) intended to make calls
return immediately for *all* tests, but removing use of RpcProxy
caused this to stop working.

When the libraries that Cinder is dependent upon change their
config options it causes the cinder.sample.conf file to fail
the check_uptodate.sh check.  This causes issues in the gate and/or
people to push up patches with unrelated config files changes.

We don't want to remove the check_uptodate.sh run as it is good to
ensure that legitimate config file changes are committed.  A compromise
is to remove the generation of external options from the sample config file,
leaving just Cinder's options.

This patch implements that proposal by commenting out the
CINDER_CONFIG_GENERATOR_EXTRA_MODULES and
CINDER_CONFIG_GENERATOR_EXTRA_LIBRARIES environment variables in
tools/config/oslo.config.generator.rc .  Lines are added to the file
explaining why the options are commented out and explaining how to
regenerate the cinder.conf.sample file with the extra modules and libraries
if desired.

This patch also adds etc/cinder/README-cinder.conf.txt with a note
indicating that the existing cinder.conf.sample file is not a full set
of configuration options.  Directions are included for generating a
full sample config.  This approach is consistent with the approach taken by
Nova.

As a convenience, allow job execution searches to be filtered by 'status'.
This search key will refer to the ""info['status']"" field in a JobExecution
record.  Because the ""info"" dictionary is stored as a string in the database,
and because it contains values from clients that may also contain 'status'
entries in nested objects, a substring search filter on the query is not reliable.
Instead results are filtered by Sahara after they are returned from sqlalchemy.

one was using rhel7 to installing it by default unless one was using
rhel6.

Change: Iae9a7a1c09f1fc83573c3926b3470955c244c401
Attempted to fix this, but only does so for precise.

Unless mariadb has become the default, I strongly prefer to keep
standard mysql as the database on ubuntu (precise or otherwise).

Some cli commands allow specifying an image by either
its name or its ID. Creating a volume from an image
currently requires knowing the image ID. The request
was made to add the ability to create a volume using
the image name instead.

This patch adds the ability to accept either name or ID.
It will attempt to locate the image based on this input
and fail if neither can be matched. If found by name, it
will also verify there are not multiple images of the
same name. If this is the case it will require using the
ID to be explicit.

Will update python-cinderclient in a separate patch once
this has been merged to allow ID or name.

Allow user to disable VIP ping resource
if user does not need public network
to be routable.

Since 5.1.1 and 6.0 releases FUEL configures ping resource that checks whether default gateway is accessible in order to fix the corresponding bug:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1370510

Nevertheless, this fix imposes the issue that if user does not have pingable default gateway, deployment of OpenStack cluster will fail as FUEL uses public VIP to configure some of OpenStack entities (e.g. floating ip pools). In order to work this around, user can specify any pingable host as a default gateway, e.g. FUEL master node or apply the patch above and change cluster attribute 'run_ping_checker' to 'false' that will disable the pinger resource. In order to do this user will need to use FUEL CLI and add this parameter manually to the deployment cluster attributes.

Also, be aware that disabling of pinger will introduce back the corresponding bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1370510

Puppet blacksmith is a ruby gem that can handle pushing new puppet
modules to the puppet forge. Right now we don't have an automated
way to push to the forge, so this is a big win. Added it to the
'release' pipeline. This job runs on the 'pypi' node which is
pypi.slave.o.o, this node is not a single use node and is trusted
with secrets for pypi uploads, maven uploads, and jenkins plugin
uploads. When this node goes trusty, it might make sense for it
to be renamed 'trusted.'

A limitation of puppet-blacksmith is that it can only source one
set of credentials. I am working on patches to allow it to handle
different credentials with a config option. This would be needed
to publish both the openstack-infra modules and the stackforge
modules.

Puppet-blacksmith does not run any user-submitted code, so it is
safe to do the entire operation on the trusted node.

Remove usage of the RpcProxy compatibility class from the ml2

Note that there is one very minor functional change here.  The base

to use is to always set the base to be N.0.  Any method that needs a
newer version should specify it.

The backing VM corresponding to a volume is cloned during create volume

during retype and backup restore. Currently, the target ESX host is
unset while calling vCenter CloneVM_Task API and hence the source ESX
host is used as the target. If the destination datastore returned by

clone fails. This patch fixes the problem by setting the target ESX

It turns out that we want unittest like things even when not running
unittests. Specifically we need things like subunit logs when running
functional tests. We should remove run-unittests and move to a single
tox runner script wherever possible. This means jobs simpler and results
in fewer surprises.

This change is the first in a few to make this happen. Step one
(implemented here) is to make run-tox.sh cover the use of
run-unittest.sh so that we can replace run-unittests.sh with run-tox.sh.
Once this is done and on all of our slave images we will convert all
jobs that use run-unittests.sh to run-tox.sh. Finally we can delete
run-tox.sh.

At some point we should consider doing similar for pep8 jobs and doc
jobs.

Bandersnatch and pypi have a failure case where uploading two files to
pypi very closely to each other results in bandersnatch thinking it has
synced serial X+1 which includes both the sdist and wheel but it really
has only synced serial X. But since X+1 is what bandersnatch thinks it
has done it will never sync the actual contents of the X+1 serial (the
second file uploaded).

To make matters worse the index.html for the project is synced assuming
both artifacts at serial X+1 were synced. This means any fetches for the
second artifact fail.

We can work around this by always uploading the wheel first. Pip prefers
wheels to sdists so uploading the wheel first ensures that the wheel is
synced properly, pip will prefer it, and our jobs should continue
running.

Eventually upstream pypi and bandersnatch will need to fix this bugs
properly but this is a reasonable thing we can do locally.

Glance api returns 500 Internal Server Error, if db deadlock occurs
in glance-registry for some reason while deleting an image.

Added `_retry_on_deadlock` decorator from Nova since we don't depend
on retrying library in Icehouse. Used this decorator on image_destroy
when db deadlock occures during image delete, which will again try to
delete the image from database.

Conflicts:
        glance/tests/unit/test_db.py

Note: In this patch, I've made few additional changes to add retrying
logic because retrying library is not available in Icehouse.

Due to an error in logic of apply_changes method
we had problems with parallel deployment of controllers
as we were generating XML patch between live CIB and
shadow generated on the base of (sometimes!) older CIB.

This could lead to the problem that crm_diff removes
some of the data from the live CIB as it was not present
in the old CIB.

An example of such behaviour is the bug with location
constraints missing for virtual ip addresses as our
service provider was creating them in this window
between shadow creation and retrieving of the live CIB
thus crm_diff was generating patch removing this location
and leading to this bug.

One of the use cases for this is the ESX driver deprecation.
In order to enable a administrator to migrate all instances
running on the ESX driver to the VC driver they will need to
do the following:

1. OpenStack: terminate the nova-compute running the ESX driver.
2. VC: Create a cluster. The ESX server will be added to this cluster.
3. OpenStack: start a new nova-compute with the VC driver.
4. OpenStack: update the database to indicate that the instance
   will be running on a new host.
5. VC: Add the ESX server to the cluster

In order to perform item #3 above a new command has been added to
the nova-manage utility. This is as follows:

nova-manage db host_update --host <current host for ESX instance>
                           --new_host <the new host for the ESX instance>
                           --new_node <the new node for the instance>

The above command will update all of the instances so that they can be
run on a VC driver.

The backing VM corresponding to a volume is cloned during create volume
from another volume, snapshot or image. The backing VM is also cloned
during retype and backup restore. Currently, the target ESX host is
unset while calling vCenter CloneVM_Task API and hence the source ESX
host is used as the target. If the destination datastore returned by
the datastore selection logic is not accessible to the source host,
clone fails. This patch fixes the problem by setting the target ESX
host (returned by datastore selection logic) while invoking clone.

Instead of using a reader/writer lock in the cache types
just take advantage of the fact that single, non-mutating
operations on dictionaries are thread-safe in python.

This means we can remove the need to have simple read-only
operations using read-locks and can just use a simpler lock
around write-operations or around read/write operations that
span multiple dictionary operations (like iteration).

it starts and waits for other nodes to join.

Other nodes join with boostrap node when it's avialable instead of
waiting for cluster with at least 2 nodes (which would never happen).

commit abc16ebf make the get_sg_ids_grouped_by_port function return [] when
the port's sec-group is None.
When you set --no-security-group for a port, security_group_info_for_devices
will get a empty list, and will NOT remove the sec-group involved.
So it should return the port dict, whose value of ['security-group'] is None,
as before.

On a compute node when the last VM with a floating IP association
is deleted, the L3 agent did not delete the fip namespace. However
the api server has already deleted the fip agent external gateway
port from the database.

This problem is happening on DVRs because the deletion of a VM port,
in addition to a floating IP disassociation, may also result in the
removal of the external gateway port binding AND the removal of the
fip agent external gateway port.

When the L3 agent is handling a routers_updated notification, it is
not processing floating ip address updates when the router has both
a floating ip disassociated and a external gateway port deleted.
This patch corrects this problem.

We've agreed to start capping the versions of libraries used in the
stable branches to more accurately reflect what we expect to be used in
a stable deployment, and to allow those libraries to release new versions
without risking breaking stable deployments.

This patch introduces caps for the Oslo and client libraries to their
current major.minor+1 value (assuming semantic versioning). There will
be another patch to update all of the third-party libraries.

Due to mutable dictionary being used as the default `target` argument
value the first target calculated from scratch in POLICY_CHECK
function will be used for all subsequent calls to POLICY_CHECK with 2
arguments. The wrong `target` can either lead to a reduced set of
operations on an entity for a given user, or to enlarged one. Due to
independent policy checks at each service's side this doesn't pose a
serious security breach, but can lead to weird UX behaviour.

When resize an instance, we don't allow a resize down operation.
Currently, a flavor ephemeral size will be used to do the check,
but usually we might create ephemeral size less than flavor

Also, the test cases are updated to change from dict to objects,

This patch adds the ability to test claims against CPU pinning data exposed
by the host and instance. This is currently a no-op as no code in the
API will actually set any pinning constraints for the instance.
Since getting the CPU pinning information  of the instance may require an
additional db roundtrip, we try to avoid getting it unless absolutely
necessary.

The resource tracker will not do any actual usage tracking yet - this
will be done in a follow-up patch.

get_available_resource() return an additional 'cpu_pinning' field in
the resources dict. The libvirt driver will actually return useful data,
while other drivers only return 'None' at this time.

We also make the resource tracker check for the presence of this field.

This patch adds the basic classes to represent host and instance CPU
pinning data (following suite with the work done for NUMA topology).

The classes come with basic pinning logic that will allow us to make
pinning placements taking into consideration hyperthreading capabilities
of the host (and instances if set).

At the moment NUMA topology is _not_ considered, however the same
packing logic will apply to each NUMA cell individually. This patch is
presented without the added complexity so that it can more easily be
used for discussions on the packing logic itself.

Follow up patch will introduce NUMA awareness when doing CPU pinning

This ""intermediate"" iscsi helper pulls all of it's
config settings from the global config.  This is fine
if you only have a single backend, but if you do
multi-backend it puts things in a bad state where some
of the backend specific settings are picked up but
others are not (for example iscsi_ip_address).

This change modifies methods like create_export in
the volume/iscsi helper to take the drivers version
of the config settings as a parameter and use those
instead of setting off of the global values.

Long term there's a lot of cleanup surrounding our
inheritance model and especially the iscsi helpers.
We can address that going forward but here we just want
to fix the bug in the safest way possible.

Extract all the logging related setup calls into a separate method in
test.py. This includes providing context in the docstring for why we
do these things.

It also changes the WARN level overrides to only happen if we are
running > DEBUG, if we actually were running with the OS_DEBUG
override one would expect everything to be running at the DEBUG level.

The ReplaceModule fixture is buggy and very sensitive to the sequence
things are imported in. It was only used in 3 places until the
functional test split landed (and had to be removed from there).

This removes the use of ReplaceModule for fake_ldap. Unwinding the
xenapi test code is a bit more challenging especially given how
spidery all that code is. So instead of fixing that move the
ReplaceModule into the xenapi test code where it's used and leave it
as an exercise for the xenapi folks to move to more real mocks or
monkey patching.

This gets it out of test.py so that no one else will accidentally use
it.

and adds data() supporting in handle_create and
handle_delete. If name looked like
'router_id:""subnet_id""=subnet_id' or similar with port_id
earlier, now resource's name looks like 'router_id'
and RouterInterface uses data() methods. Also, it
supports compatibility with old resources, which
names look like 'router_id:subnet_id=""subnet_id""' or
'router_id:subnet_id'. Besides that, patch adds attributes
router_id, subnet_id and port_id to the resource.

Presently, the wsgi server allows persist connections hence even after
the response is sent to the client, it doesn't close the client socket
connection.
Because of this problem, the green thread is not released back to the pool.

In order to close the client socket connection explicitly after the
response is sent and read successfully by the client, you simply have to
set keepalive to False when you create a wsgi server.

Add a parameter to take advantage of the new(ish) eventlet socket timeout
behaviour. Allows closing idle client connections after a period of
time, eg:

$ time nc localhost 8776
real    1m0.063s

Setting 'client_socket_timeout = 0' means do not timeout.

DocImpact:
Added wsgi_keep_alive option (default=True).
Added client_socket_timeout option (default=900).

This patch changes the above form to a zero expression raise statement in those

rw_handles needed to be updated to requests and that we needed to
enable SSL certificate validation as well. This change consolidates
the create connection methods into FileHandle class and ensures that
additional headers and cacerts etc can be passed in for use during
the file upload/download process. Note that the create write connection
uses the httplib-equivalent support bundled in requests/urllib3 as
requests does not support the pattern of exposing a file like object
with multiple writes for the HTTP PUT operation, it only allows one
to pass a completely built file or file like object with data
already in memory. We need to be able to read buffers from somewhere
else (glance) and do a http put with that incremental data. This
usecase/pattern is not currently supported in requests.

Updates the v2 and v3 /servers and /servers/detail APIs to support the
multiple sort keys and sort directions (using the 'sort_key' and
'sort_dir' parameters); these parameters can be specified multiple
times to create a list of sort keys and directions. These parameters
are passed from the API layer to the compute layer, then to the
instance layer (with updated version), then to the database layers,
and then to the common paginate_query function; the paginate_query
function already supports multiple sort keys and directions. The
function signatures in these various layers are updated with new
'sort_keys' and 'sort_dirs' parameters that represent the sort keys
and directions information as lists.

This support is enabled on the v2 API by the existence of a new
'os-server-sort-keys' API extension and is always enabled in the v3
API. The extension API sample issues 2 server creates and then ensures
that both servers are listed (name is unique) in the list reply.

DocImpact: The existing v2 and v3 servers API documentation needs to
reflect these new parameters.

The nova client will also be updated to use these parameters.

When Get EC2 metadata localip, it will return
<instanceIP, Controller_Local_IP>, but for ec2
metadata localip, it expects to return instanceIP.
This patch fixes the issue.

Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 introduces a new feature for virtual
machines named ""generation 2"".

Generation 2 VMs don't support IDE devices, meaning that VHDs
and DVD Drives must be attached as SCSI, instead of IDE.

Since the Virtual Hard Disks and Virtual CD/DVD Disks can be
attached to IDE controllers or SCSI controllers (generation 2
only), some constants, variables and methods have been
improperly named, having the IDE prefix.

Partially implements: blueprint hyper-v-generation-2-vms

Unfortunately we need to provide support for other clients and services
that override the service catalog with custom endpoints. Allow a user to
specify a URL that should be used for an endpoint rather than fetching
it from the service catalog.

We may need something like this for the auth plugins as well but this
should be enough for current use cases.
