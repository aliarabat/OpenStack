This makes the backup and snapshot paths use objects.  To make things
cleaner for syncing compute rpcapi and cells rpcapi, the
single snapshot_instance rpc method that was used for both snapshot and

Still a WIP, TODO :
    a bit more testing
    implement caching (when DIB_OFFLINE is set)

If there are multiple OVS agents concurrently executing
'tunnel_sync' RPC call a race condition can occur
leading to insertion of two different TunnelEndpoint
entries having the same 'id' value.

Unfortunately, we can not rely on:
  - @lockutils.synchronized(), because a Neutron installation can use
    more than one API node
  - with_lockmode('update'), because it works differently in PostgreSQL
    comparing to MySQL and doesn't guarantee that no new rows have been
    added to the table since the select query was issued. Please take a
    look at http://www.postgresql.org/files/developer/concurrency.pdf for
    more details.

The proposed fix:
  - ensures there is a unique constraint set for 'id' column
  - wraps creation of a new TunnelEndpoint entry into a
    repeatedly executed transactional block (so even if a concurrent
    DB transaction has been flushed or commited earlier than this one
    we can handle an integrity error and try again, in spite of the
    specified transactions isolation level value)

Implements: blueprint api-group-by

Adds group by meter statistics in the MongoDB driver for the case
where the groupby fields are a combination of 'user-id',
'resource-id', 'project-id', and 'source' (metadata fields not
implemented)

The group by meter statistics can be requested with query filtering
and/or period parameters.  In this case, the query filtering and/or
period grouping is applied first, followed by the calculation of
group by meter statistics.

Refactors the meter statistics map functions MAP_STATS and
MAP_STATS_PERIOD to remove duplicate code

Modifies test_group_by_unknown_field in class StatisticsGroupByTest
so that it works for both the SQL Alchemy driver and the MongoDB
driver; the previous version only worked for the SQL Alchemy driver

Some notes on the implementation:
- extends Resource rather than Instance since most of the
  complexity of Instance is in the handling of the Volumes
  attribute
- exposed properties and attributes map as closely as possible
  to the underlying v1 nova API (rather than the nova client library)
- property or attribute key namespaces have been stripped to provide
  a cleaner API and avoid YAML quoting.
  (eg instance_name -> 'OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:instance_name')
- an assumption is currently made that any volumes specified
  in block_device_mapping should not be detached on suspend
- Network address properties attempt to cater for simple and
  advanced use-cases:
  - 'first_private_address' and 'first_public_address' for simple
    template attribute scenarios, and to aid with AWS::EC2::Instance
    transition
  - 'networks' for a simple data structure which provides all addresses
  - 'addresses' for the raw data structure returned by the API

Python3 reorganized the standard library and moved several functions
to different modules. Six provides a consistent interface
to them through the fake six.moves module.

However, the urlparse, urllib2, etc modules have been combined
into one module which Six does not support so we do it via
py3kcompat.

Modules such as StringIO and CStringIO have been removed
completely so we use the io module.

Fixes aggregate creation so an attempt to create an aggregate with
a null name results in a 400 Bad Request rather than 409 Conflict.
This was fixed for the V2 api in 43f9028f84ffec9b465bec10025ba75266c1bc22
and is fixed in this changeset for the V3 api

For both the V2 and V3 APIs adds a check to ensure that the aggregate
name is not longer than 255 characters.

Also fixes null or too long names when updating an aggregate

If you do a call() with e.g. the kombu driver, and there is no consumer
listening, then you will get a Timeout exception.

However, with the fake driver, we just silently return None in this
case. The oslo.messaging fake driver instead raises a Timeout and this
behaviour change turned up a tonne of issues with Nova's unit tests.

Make this change here too so that we can merge fixes for Nova's tests
before porting to oslo.messaging.

Note that although we also raise a Timeout in the case of cast(), but
cast() then just ignores the exception.

This commit just syncs this change from oslo-incubator.

The Token Provider was not aware of expired tokens, and would
not raise Unauthorized if a token was expired when asked
to ""validate"" (validate_token, validate_v2_token, validate_v3_token)
or ""check"" (check_v2_token, check_v3_token) it. The assumption was
that the Token driver would never return an expired token  from
the token_api.get_token method.  When token caching is implemented,
this assumption can no longer be made.

This patchset updates the provider to make it capable of inspecting
token data returned by the token validation methods on the driver.
If a token is expired it will properly raise Unauthorized.

Refactored the Token Provider to noi longer use a separate code-path
to ""validate"" or ""check"" tokens.  Check now benefits from the code
to ensure a token is still valid.

Since caching is implemented at the manager level, the expiration
check is done in the manager (above the driver), it is expected
that the manager needs to be expiration aware (responses from the
driver may be cached).

Based upon the Keystone caching (using dogpile.cache) implementation
token revocation list caching is implemented in this patchset.

The following methods are cached:
    * token_api.list_revoked_tokens

Calls to token_api.delete_token and token_api.delete_tokens will
properly invalidate the cache for the revocation list.

Reworked some of the caching tests to allow for more in-depth
tests of the cache layer.

API policy protection is currently limited to using the parameters
passed into the call. However, there are many cases where you want
to also check attributes of the entities an API is operating upon.  The
classic example is ensuring a domain administrator cannot get, update or
delete users, groups or projects outside of their domain.

This patch enables lines in the policy file to also refer to any field
in the target object of the API call. In addition, it includes a separate
sample policy file that shows how to use domains and the new protection
ability to provide domain segregation and administration delegation.
This sample file is also tested to ensure that such protection works
correctly.

compute node through libvirt qemu extension api(qemuAgentCommand)
through guest agent, I think this is a useful way to help us to
interact with guest more directly and efficiently.
DocImpact: please refer the page of bp

Implements blueprint qemu-guest-agent-support

Currently it was logged only when cli subprocess call itself
failed, so there was not enough debug output when asserts/test cases
failed.

Also stderr was logged only when it was merged to the stdout (almost
never).

Now we also don't have any use for check_output method anymore,
as cli.cmd() always captures the stderr,
whatever if for logging or merged into stdout for tests.

Also fixes invalid log.warning on newline at the end of ascii table.

In run_tests.sh, function init_testr will initialize testr if the
directory .testrepository is not existed. Actually, testr will do
the check before run the test:

In Python package testrepository, setuptools_command.py:Testr.run

68 def run(self):

So, init_testr can be removed safely.

names if they've already set them to something.  So if they've set
the volume name already, leave it alone.  If they've set the size

Bug 1214879

Add a relationship performing eager load in the Port model, thus preventing
the 'extend' function from performing an extra query.
This patch also replaces assertTrue with assertEqual in unit tests as it
needs to evaluate whether the value of the mac_learning_enabled attribute
is equal to the boolean literal True, whereas assertTrue verifies that the
expression passed to it evaluates to True. This means that any value but
False will be enough for the test to pass, which is not correct.

In this patch:
1. Add defense in assignment.backends.ldap.Assignment::_get_metadata(),
return empty dict rather than throw exception when userid==None or
tenantid==None.
2. Remove checking existance of tenant_id and user_id

Add PCI alias support.

User may have specific device requirements for passthrough device, like
specific NIC card from specific vendor with specific network access.

It's too long and not straightforward to specify these requirements in
flavor directly, also cloud administrator may want to control what pci
requirements the user can specify and want to hide some device details
like the switch IP address a NIC is connected.

Pci alias is defined to specify the pci requirements and is specified in
the flavor extra specs. The API layer will translate the alias information
in flavor extra specs to pci requirement according to pci alias definition.

So first off, I also don't like the replicating of the api_opts in wsgi.py
but if I don't do that the sample generator doesn't work:(

We add the wsgi options into a group for each of the api servers with
the deprecated group of ""DEFAULT"" so it still deals with the flat layout.

The behaviour is as follows (assuming heat-api):
1) if you have both (/etc/heat/{heat.conf, heat-api.conf}
   the value in heat-api.conf wins over heat.conf
2) if you have just one of the config files but a value in both the
   [DEFAULT] section and the [heat-api] section then the value in heat-api
   wins.

Implements core elements of Keystone Caching layer. dogpile.cache
is used as the caching library to provide flexibility to the cache
backend (out of the box, Redis, Memcached, File, and in-Memory).

The keystone.common.cache.on_arguments decorator is used cache the
return value of method and functions that are meant to be cached.

The default behavior is to not cache anything (using a no-op cacher).

developing.rst has been updated to give an outline on how to approach
adding the caching layer onto a manager object.

Subsequent patches will build upon this code to enable caching across
the various keystone subsystems.

Blueprint: hyper-v-wmi-v2

The Hyper-V APIs are mainly based on WMI. The original 2008 Hyper-V
release introduced the ""root\virtualization"" namespace which got
superseded in Hyper-V Server / Windows Server 2012 by the
""root\virtualization\v2"" namespace (referred as V2 in the sources).

The original namespace has been dropped in the upcoming Hyper-V 2012
R2 (currently available in preview), which means that the Grizzly code
will not be compatible with it as is.

The Hyper-V driver is structured with a clear decoupling between OS
interaction classes (so called *utils modules and classes) and the
agent's logic.

This allows us to provide an implementation of the V2 API without
impacting the rest of the agent's code, based on a factory module
added to instantiate the proper version of the *utils classes: the
original ""V1"" ones for versions of the OS predating 2012 and the
newer ""V2"" ones starting from Hyper-V 2012 (Windows kernel version
6.2).

The problem is that when the availability_zones for one host
aggregation was updated, the VM attribute of availability_zones
which belong to the host in the availability_zones was
not updated on time.

If updated values include availability_zones, then the cache
which stored availability_zones and host need to be reset.

OS-EP-FILTER Implementation

There are new methods to create endpoint and project associations.
A full CRUD API to assign projects to endpoints as well as
the ability to check all the projects associated with a given
endpoint.

The association is used to pick what endpoints are visible
for the given project and a filtered catalog is built
accordingly.

During a project-scoped token request, if project-endpoint
associations have been created, the returned catalog will only
list the project linked endpoints.

This modification addresses Bug #1210292, specifically addressing
the case where the test framework callstack is cleared when no
asserts are raised in assert_called_anytime. This test method
verifies that a specific API method call was made at any time
during a test. If a test makes multiple calls to this method, and
the first call yields no assertions, the subsequent calls will fail
because the first assert in the method verifies that the callstack
is non-empty. The error itself likely exists because
assert_called_anytime is not currently used in the
python-cinderclient testing framework.

The fix involves deleting the last line in the method that clears
the callstack.

Fixes: bug 1210292

Enable migration for attached volumes by calling Nova to have the
hypervisor copy the data (Nova's swap_volume feature). A new API
function is added for Nova to call once it is done copying to finish
the Cinder side of the migration.

The overall 'generic' migration flow (i.e., not performed by a driver)
is as follows:
1. Creates a new volume
2a. If the source volume's state is 'available', attach both volumes
    and run 'dd' to copy, then detach both. When finished, call the
    migrate_volume_completion function.
2b. If the source volume's state is 'in-use', call Nova to perform the
    copy. Nova will attach the new volume, copy the data from the
    original volume to the new one, and detach the original volume.
    When the copy completes, Nova will call Cinder's new
    migrate_volume_completion function.
3. The migrate_volume_completion function deletes the original volume,
   and calls the database API's finish_volume_migration function. This
   copies all of the new volume's information to the original, and
   deletes the new volume's row, and thus we can keep using the
   original volume_id (the user sees no change).

We also don't change the original volume's status, and instead add a
migration_status column which only selected users can see (e.g., admin).
The migration status is None when no migration is in progress, whether
it succeeded or failed. The admin should check the volume's current
host to determine success or failure. This is meant to simplify
operations. The user will only be aware of a migration if they try to
change the volume's state during the course of a migration.

As mentioned, we change the volume while keeping the original volume
ID. Because a volume's name depends on its ID, the new volume will have
a different name than the original. This is the purpose of the name_id
field in the database - the name is now based on name_id. So although
we keep the original volume's ID, we use the new volume's ID as the
name_id. Thus we can remove the rename_volume function - it is no
longer necessary because the name_id field in the database already
allows for the volume's name on the backend to not rely on its ID.
The user than can see the migration_status can also see the
name_id, in case they need to find it on the backend.

There were a few other places throughout the code that relied on
constructing a volume's name from its ID, and those were fixed.

Add allownoqa decorator that can be applied to any of the hacking
core functions.  This allows a using application to bypass that
particular hacking validation.  The reason this is being introduced
is because I need to bypass H231 and H233, both Python 3.x
validations.  I need to bypass these so we can run pep8 validations
on the nova XenServer plugins.  XenServer usese Python 2.4 in its
environment and therefore the code won't pass those two or future
Python 3.x validations.

It is understood that a patch to hacking won't be held up or reverted
if it breaks anything Python 2.4 related, including breaking of this
patch.

This builds on previous patches that moved code to
the conductor and adding the conductor into the control path.

We take care to ensure this works with a local conductor, but
running the code in a greenlet thread, but this will work best
when conductor is run as a standalone service.

Fixes bug 1214132.

This patch makes it easy to launch a bunch of neutron-server processes
on a host. Deploying multiple neutron-server workers per host avoids
serialization on database accesses caused by libmysqlclient.so
blocking eventlet's single thread.

This patch makes use of the same multi-process service launching code
used in nova, neutron.openstack.common.service.ProcessLauncher. The
bulk of this patch moves the socket and listen system calls before the
fork call.

Adds workers=N to the [DEFAULT] section of neutron.conf.

The websockify package was recently upgraded to version 0.5.1, which added two
parameters that provide additional security:
* no_parent - returns 403 response if contents out of the web root are
requested. Required to disable directory traversal.
* file_only - returns 404 response if non-file contents are requested. Required
to disable directory listing.
This version is available in PyPi.

Nova should upgrade it's required version for websockify, and set these
parameters while creating and starting the NovaWebSocketProxy to ensure
better security.

Propose a new graph flow that will run every task
in the graph at the same time but will use a count
down latch concept to ensure that a tasks dependents
are provided before the task itself can run. This
allows for tasks to run in parallel (if they have
no dependents or are placed in disjoint parts of
graph).

Note: although this flow uses threads it is typically
expected that the underlying threads would be greenthreads
since python native threading is still suboptimal (for
various reasons).

Cinder has its own ProcessExecutionError exception defined which
already exists in processutils.py. This was done to have minimal
editing when applying processutils.execute() to Cinder. As a result,
new instances are being created for each exception raised during

1) Child cell scheduling fails.  The change to use Instance.create() in
child cells broke things.  The instance properties was being overwritten
due to a typo.  I also found a number of other things that need to be
popped out before passing to create_db_entry_for_new_instance().

2) Notification to the API cell was failing.  We cannot pass an object to
instance_update_at_top().

3) When cells is enabled, deleting an instance hits the '_local_delete'
part of code in the API because we don't see the compute node.  There's
a trap in cells_api.py to forward the delete on to child cells, but we
need to make sure not to try to deallocate network in the API cell.

When starting an instance, a few properties from the image will be saved
in the instance's system_metadata under the prefix 'image_'. This way,
when creating an snapshot, resizing, migrating or rescuing an instance
we can preserve the original properties even if the source image has
been deleted or made private.

This is done by adding two utility functions that translate the image
metadata into system metadata and vice versa. These are  used from the
operations specified before to complement the image metadata and
preventing them to fail if the image doesn't exist.

The keys that the instance will inherit from the image are: 'min_ram',
'min_disk', 'disk_format' and 'container_format' together with the
inheritable image properties.

Fixes bug #1039662

Offline snapshots for the GlusterFS driver, based
on QCOW2 snapshotting.

This introduces the option to have volumes stored as
qcow2 files rather than raw files. (glusterfs_qcow2_volumes)

Bump driver version to 1.1.0.

This patch requires Nova to support loading qcow2 disks:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/38321/

Online snapshot support (via Nova) is added in a
subsequent patch submitted in this series.

This patch also enables volume cloning for GlusterFS volumes.

Implements blueprint qemu-assisted-snapshots

Invalid PKI tokens are cached in memcache using the entire token as
key. This triggers the familiar memcache key length error since a
PKI token is much longer than 250 characters.

This change hashes the token before using it as a key, and also changes
instances of ""token"" to ""token_id"" where appropriate so it's clear
that we're passing around a hashed token rather than the token data
itself.

This patch does a simple refactoring of test_l3_plugin, pushing out tests
aimed at validating the interactions of the l3 agent with the server.

These tests explicitly use TestL3NatPlugin, whereas all the
other tests use a configurable plugin, which might be specificed by a child

child classes, especially those not using the l3 agent - for which running
these test is also superfluous.

This patch adds support for a new kind of Glance image, a specially crafted ISO
which supports iPXE booting, giving customers a means to roll their own image.

Two virt-layer modifications were needed. The first was adding configurations
for the iPXE ISO feature (network to use, boot menu, mkisofs_cmd). The second
was the ability to inject networking info into the ISO after it was
downloaded.

To use this feature, operators should enable the `ipxe_boot` image-property.

Concurrency. Sigh.

A sequence of events like this is possible:

  - We send a request from thread A
  - Thread B, who is waiting for a response gets scheduled
  - Thread B receives our response and queues it up
  - Thread B receives its own response and drops the connection lock
  - Thread A grabs the connection lock and wait for a response to arrive

The obvious solution is that when we grab the connection lock, we should
check whether a previous lock-holding thread had already received our
response and queued it up.
