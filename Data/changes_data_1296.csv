A recent bug was reported when a developer was trying to work
with the iscsi target unit tests.  There were two problems discovered,
one of which has been addressed by the dependent patch of this commit
(https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68223/) which fixed the inconsistencies
in the string we used for iqn's in our test.

This patch addresses another issue that's somewhat related and was
exposed when the developer tried to use the ""self.target_name"" variable
instead of hard-coding the iqn's in the tests.

The problem is that the target_name variable uses an invalid format
for the iqn based on cinder-defaults.  It neglected to use the
volume_name prefix (in this case: ""volume-"").

This patch modifies the self.target_name variable to be more accurate
with what we would see in real usage, it also modifies the test to just
use this variable rather than hard coding it and running the risk of
having mismatches again in the future.

During long stress runs the WMI query that is looking for
the iSCSI device number can incorrectly return no data.
If the query is retried the appropriate data can then be
obtained.

This commit adds a retry loop, calling
basevolumeutils.get_device_number_for_target to avoid this situation.
It also handles the case where the devices list returned in
get_device_number_for_target is empty.  The retry loop is
implemented with new mounted_disk_query_retry_count and
mounted_disk_query_retry_interval configuration options.

Unit tests have been added to check the good and bad paths for
get_mounted_disk_from_lun.

The test creates 3 backups with the rotation 2 and checks that
2 backups exist with getting its image list. test_create_backup
fails sometimes due to the existence of 3 backups.

Glance v1 delete_image API changes an image's status to 'deleted'
then the deleted flag to 'true'. If getting a list between the
status change and the delete flag change, we can get a list including
the deleting backup also like the following:

{""images"": [
  {""status"": ""deleted"", ""name"": ""backup-1-tempest-438772029"",
   ""deleted"": false, ..},
  {""status"": ""active"", ""name"": ""backup-2-tempest-2111479443"",
   ""deleted"": false, ..},

To avoid this situation, this patch adds the status 'active' to the
calls which get the backup list.

Services that inherit service.py/Service class would register
themselves to DB and then update stats periodically (every
report_interval second).  The consumer of this kind of information,
like scheduler or 'os-service' API extension, will consider a service
is 'up' (active) if last update from that service is not longer than
'service_down_time' ago.

The problem is if 'report_interval' was configured/provided greater
than 'service_down_time' by mistake, services would then be always
considered in 'down' state, which can result in unsuccesful placement
of volume create request for example.  This is what Bug #1255685 is
about.

In previous fix: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/60760/, a
configuration check helper function basic_config_check() was added
*wrongly* to WSGIService class instead of Service class.  This patch
moves the configuration check helper function and the check to the
right place to make sure 'report_interval' is less then
'service_down_time'.

This patch makes sure that _create_images_and_backing method of the
libvirt driver (called in several places, but most problematic one is
the call in the pre_live_migration method) creates all the files the
instance needs that are not present.

Prioir to this patch - the method would only attempt to download the
image, and if it did so with the path of the ephemeral drives, it could
expose the image to other users as an ephemeral devices. See the related
bug for more detaiis.

After this patch - we properly distinguish between image, ephemeral and
swap files, and make sure that the imagebackend does the correct thing.

It seems that sometimes tests can fail when reading the config
and the suspected cause is a race caused by running the tests in
parallel when using the global set_override on oslo.config.

Stubbing all calls to the config should solve this issue (although
it is a bit cumbersome in the test..)

This patch is second in a series of patches to unify the code for
property and parameter validation based on a common Schema class.

The current patch moves the formating of parameters during the
template-validate API into a new function in the API layer.
Previously, only a dictionary of internal parameter schema
objects was returned, which meant a close coupling between
the engine's internal data structures and the API expected
format.
With the new format function in the API, we are able to better
separate internal data from API formats and can maintain API
compatibility when refactoring inside the engine.
In a subsequent patch, we can thus move to a consolidated code
base for parameter schema validation (based on the common Schema
class) and don't have to distinguish between CFN and HOT inside
the engine.

necessary to install qpid-python in the venv for OpenStack
services that use it, and it isn't listed in Nova's

to work properly.

Neither of the bugs referenced below are for Nova, but I include
them for context.  There is resistance from upstream projects to
adding qpid-python to their requirements.txt, so it seems this
workaround is going to be the only way to provide compatibility

Previously, if a number-in-a-string was passed as a Number or Integer
property, it would be validated as correct but not be converted to
an integer (it's clear that the code intended to do this but had a trivial
bug).

Unfortunately, making this change causes some backwards incompatibility.

- Previously, an AllowedValues field could have strings in it, e.g.
  ['1', '3', '5'], and this would work if a string was passed as the
  real value.
- Resource code that relied on users accidentally passing strings
  instead of numbers will now break, since it will actually be
  receiving real numbers.

You can see evidence of this in the tests I had to update
elsewhere. I don't believe any existing Heat resources are affected
by this, but it is possible that there are some templates out there
that will break.

This patch now cleanes up the publishing so that webhelp only
contains the admin-guide-cloud directory as it should.

The patch also does some minor cleanup of the pom file and removes
an unneeded generate-pdf execution.

Note: If this patch gets accepted, I will look at the other pom files
as well.

Fixes: bug #1271193
Implements: blueprint centos-rhel-for-dashboard

On centos/rhel we now support the sites-enabled/sites-available style
confs.  This patch moves to use this approach on centos/rhel. It also
fixes the above bug which was causing the site not to get loaded
properly because it did not have the .conf extension. Also remove the
rhel/centos specific tests for the openstack-dashboard site since
rhel/centos now behaves the same as ubuntu in this regard.

Note I am purposely ignoring fedora/others in this patch since the level
of support for those is still tbd.

When running ""tox -e py27 test_auth"", the first test in
test_v3_auth.TestAuthJSON would fail with an authentication error.
This is because earlier tests had already loaded up the
authentication plugins and hadn't cleared them when done. This
change makes it so that the authentication plugins are cleared in
any test loading backends so that should make sure they're always
cleared for the next test.

Before this fix which was included in eventlet 0.10.0:

https://bitbucket.org/which_linden/eventlet/issue/92/eventletgreen-override-of-oswaitpid

the os.wait() wrapper in eventlet would not block if no child processes
had exited. This was clearly buggy behaviour and os.wait() no blocks
correctly. However, it appears it now does not return if the parent process
was interrupted by a signal. This means that you can't kill the parent process
and have the child processes cleaned up gracefully.

To avoid all these issues, switch to non-blocking wait behaviour. We use
WNOHANG with waitpid() to poll for an exited child process and, if there
is none, we yield to other green threads and sleep for a short period.
This means excessive CPU usage, though, which will be tracked by
bug #1095346.

Check pid to avoid some unnecessary warning/info messages in the logs

Fixes LP #1094076

Refactors the logic where we build the credentials (or auth context), to be

This patch lays the plumbing for bp client-ssl-certificate-authorization.

DocImpact: added a new build_auth_context middleware filter to the API
pipelines in keystone-paste.ini. It is responsible for building the auth
context (a.k.a. policy-check credentials) based on the incoming auth token
to facilitate API authorization. Auth context is required for API

The v2.0 API spec uses username for the user's name, whereas the v3 API
just uses name. The v2.0 implementaion incorrectly used name instead of
username, but did allow a username to be specified and stored in the
extras.

This patch makes the implementation more closely conform to the API
without breaking backward compatibility. Anyone using name in the v2.0
API can continue to do so. They can even specify a username that will
still get stored in the extras. Users can now use the documented
username instead of name and the API will work for them as well.

Both name and username will always be returned for the v2 API calls.

If the dhcp-agent machine restarts when openvswitch comes up it logs the
following warning messages for all tap interfaces that do not exist:

bridge|WARN|could not open network device tap2cf7dbad-9d (No such device)

Once the dhcp-agent starts it recreates the interfaces and re-adds them to the
ovs-bridge. Unfortunately, ovs does not reinitialize the interfaces as they
are already in ovsdb and does not assign them a ofport number.

This situation corrects itself though the next time a port is added to the
ovs-bridge which is why no one has probably noticed this issue till now.

In order to correct this we should first remove interface that exist and
then readd them.

Instead of having many of the instance local variables
be created in the __init__ method, instead create them
during the compilation stage where most of these variables
are actually used. This allows for the multi-threaded
engine to not have to setup an instance variable before the
parent constructor is called and seems cleaner in general.

Ensure that a engine that is not compiled can not be
suspended since it seems like an inappropriate action for an
engine to allow when it has not been compiled.

The unit test test_connection_to_primitive fails many times due to
""virConnect instance has no attribute 'registerCloseCallback'"".

registerCloseCallback has been added since original(community's)
python-libvirt v1.0.0, and v1.2.0 also contains the method.
However ubuntu cloud's v1.0.1 does not contain the method, and current
version check of python-libvirt does not work.
This patch tries to operate the method and catch TypeError exception if
the method does not exist instead of the version check.

If a snapshot is attempted to be taken when Glance can't find the
underlying image (usually because it's been deleted), then ImageNotFound
is raised to nova.compute.manager.ComputeManager._snapshot_instance. The
error path for this leaves the instance in a snapshotting state; after
which ""operator intervention"" is required.

This simply reverts the instance state under that specific circumstance.

DocImpact: previously a snapshot that failed for this reason would leave
the instance in a spurious snapshotting task state indefinitely. Now,
the task state is reverted. At the moment that revert is 'silent'
(although the failure to snapshot will be evident to the user).

With the change to use oslo's db.sqlalchemy.sessions, the
sql.Base class isn't doing enough to justify its continued
existence.

This change is removing the get_session member, which was just
a new name for openstack.common.db.sqlalchemy.session.get_session() .

Update nova.network to make use of the DNSDomain and DNSDomainList
objects.  This removes more direct db API usage from nova-network.

This patch includes one really nice optimization, as well.  The method
get_dns_domains() used to call nova.db.dnsdomain_list(), which would
return a list of all domains in the database.  It would then call
_prepare_domain_entry() on each one, which would go back and query the
database again for each one to get the rest of the data associated with
it.  All of this data was actually returned from the db originally, but
the db API didn't return it.  Instead, it now gets all of this data
from the original db query for the list, eliminating N db queries each
time this code runs.

not work correctly if the key is not set, so including this option
is helpful for Tempest testing and volume encryption within
DevStack.

Avoid moving logs into the jenkins homedir unnecessarily, since it
has a tendency to fill up the root filesystem and the SCP publisher
can follow symlinks out of the workspace anyway. We've seen slaves
go offline due to full root filesystems recently, so this should
hopefully reduce the incidence of that problem.

it so that it could easily be used in other places.

This test case makes a bad assumption about when a greenthread will run
and signal its done event.  The test code yields once using a sleep and
expects that the done event will get signaled before the test code runs
again.  This may not be the case.  Instead, yield up to 10 times waiting
for the done event to occur.

I was not able to reproduce this failure locally, but we're seeing it
regularly in CI.  It seems that this should resolve it.

This is needed for SOS (along with patch

to work with swift 1.12 . By spec you should always use the absolute
location but this causes a problem with staticweb over a cdn using a
cname. Basically you want to be able to forward the browser to a
relative location instead of whatever full url the proxy server
thinks you are using.

The tempest tests were leaving volumes behind when it
finished up.  Turns out these were from the test_volume_transfer
tests.

The normal delete/cleanup methods can't be used here because we do
the whole bit of transferring the ownership of the volume so the base
client isn't the one that ends up having access to the volume.

This patch adds a delete and wait for cleanup method that's called
by the addition of an addCleanup task.

This commit adds support for the neutron extension detection to the

slightly differently from the other services in that several of the
extensions' name field is really a title that includes spaces. This
can't be used for the list option and the tempest code already
assumes that the alias field is used instead of name.

Some parameters of quota_class_set are not used in Nova v1.1/v2 API. And
some items have wrong type and key name.
QuotaClassSet class has id property originally. But 'id' comes from Nova
API currently. So we can just use it as its id.

This commit fixes and cleanups them.

In a recent oslo sync commit Ib9b07fe733dc2c924ac0eb054fa707dd352a812b,
post_process() has been removed from tools/install_venv_common.py.
However, it's still called in tools/install_venv.

The current code for CentOS looks like trying to install the openssl
after trying to compile pyOpenSSL. So this can't be working.

This change switches tools/install_venv.py to use oslo code to align the
effort as well as fixing original no 'post_process' issue.

Note: openstack-common.conf is not updated. Because the project name
variable in install_venv has to be modified after syncing from oslo.
That makes it not an exact sync but modification after sync now.

This test case makes a bad assumption about when a greenthread will run
and signal its done event.  The test code yields once using a sleep and
expects that the done event will get signaled before the test code runs
again.  This may not be the case.  Instead, yield up to 10 times waiting
for the done event to occur.

I was not able to reproduce this failure locally, but we're seeing it
regularly in CI.  It seems that this should resolve it.

Currently filtering is only done at the controller level, leading to
performance issues since we are not using native filtering capabilities
of any of the underlying backends (e.g. SQL, LDAP). This patch enables
such support.

This support is provided via a generic 'driver hints' approach, allowing
other types of hints to be added in the future.

Limitations:

- The LDAP backend does not yet support for filtering, leaving it for
  the controller level.  LDAP support will be added in a separate patch
- Filtering for service, endpoint and policy is left at the controller
  level, since these operations are not considered performance issues.
- Due to MySQL defaults, case sensitive filters are not yet well tested

When disable/enable a cinder service, there is no output, this
caused end user does not know if the service was disabled/enabled
successfully.

It is better add some output for the command just like nova to tell
end user the service status.

Brick's TargetAdmin classes have a
default value set in __init__ for
iscsi_target_prefix.   The unit test was changing
the value returned for the internal _get_target,
but wasn't changing the CONF.iscsi_target_prefix to
match.  So the default value in the __init__ was
being used and hence the differences.

This patch sets the configuration's iscsi_target_prefix
which alters the values passed into the driver.  This
also makes the tests consistent between the iqn of the volume
at create time and delete time.

fixed a bug where we weren't copying the bootable properties
of a volume or snapshot on create from snap or volume.

This didn't however handle the case of non-bootable volumes/snaps.

The result is that when the db call to get the image metadata raises
a NotFound exception we don't handle it and crash, causing the create
operation to fail.

This adds a try/except block around the copy volume/snap
glance_metadata get calls and ignores the exception.

This patch makes sure that i_create_images_and_backing method of the
libvirt driver (called in several places, but most problematic one is
the call in the pre_live_migration method) creates all the files the
instance needs that are not present.

Prioir to this patch - the method would only attempt to download the
image, and if it did so with the path of the ephemeral drives, it could
expose the image to other users as an ephemeral devices. See the related
bug for more detaiis.

After this patch - we properly distinguish between image, ephemeral and
swap files, and make sure that the imagebackend does the correct thing.

The existing code wouldn't allow you to delete 'broken' instances that were
(for whatever reason) missing their InstanceInfoCache entry. This patch fixes
it such that those instances can be deleted.

Adds a test case to cover the new exception handling.

This changes the baremetal deploy helper to be able to preserve the
ephemeral partition, if the deploy requests that. The next patch in

connects it to the deploy() method.

The v2 token controller incorrectly checks for a string instead
of a boolean, which results in the wrong user ID (trustee, when
it should be the trustor) when impersonation=True.  So fix the
comparison and tests, adding a test which illustrates the issue.

This patchset also closes the gap that allows EC2 credentials to
be issued from trust-scoped tokens, allowing privilege escalation
since EC2 tokens have no concept of trust-scoping/role
restrictions in the Grizzly release.

authtoken middleware's current purpose is to set X-Auth-Url header to a
value read from heat.conf.

Since this value is not really related to anything the keystone
middleware does and is instead read from a config file, it makes sense
to move it from the authtoken middleware into its own middleware

This change is the first step to grouping all X-Auth-Url related logic
into one single middleware as opposed to have it scattered (or possibly
repeated) in auth_token and auth_password. For example, auth_password
also has some logic around it related to multi-cloud, which can be
extracted and moved to auth_url middleware in a later patch, so that all
handling of X-Auth-Url occurs in one place.

Also, by extracting the X-Auth-Url logic, it allows cloud
providers to remove auth_token or auth_password without side-effects.

In some scenarios, the user might not have a second interface to
properly use the l3-agent, but still wants the cookbook to setup the
external openvswitch bridge.

This change breaks the ovs-vsctl calls in two executes, one for creating
the bridge (with a slightly altered `not_if` if it already exists) and
one for the actual `add-port` call:

The port (with the physical interface) will not be added if:

- the interface does not exist or
- the attribute external_network_bridge_interface is empty, """", or
- the interface is already part of the external bridge.

The specs and attribute docs have been changed accordingly.  Bumped

We recently had an issue with some Swift logic in the base DiskFile that
resulted in the introduction of the new DiskFileExpired exception.

The mem_diskfile implementation didn't get updated so the bug remained there.

This change begins the work of moving the mem_diskfile implementaiton to
subclass(es) of the base diskfile implementation.  Because the
mem_diskfile.DiskFile reuses _verify_integrity the X-Delete-At logic is no
longer duplicated and the new behavior for DiskFileExpired is inherited.

Creating network resources before the agents start with the ml2
plugin might result in bnding failures for some resources such as
DHCP ports because the resources are created before the agents
report to the server.

This patch should ensure all agents have started and reported
their state to the server before creating network resources.

This test case makes a bad assumption about when a greenthread will run
and signal its done event.  The test code yields once using a sleep and
expects that the done event will get signaled before the test code runs
again.  This may not be the case.  Instead, yield up to 10 times waiting
for the done event to occur.

I was not able to reproduce this failure locally, but we're seeing it
regularly in CI.  It seems that this should resolve it.

This test includes 2 calls to time.time().  It assumes that the result
from the second call may be greater than the first.  This isn't
definietly true and we see periodic failures of this test in the gate as
a result.

Change the test to not worry about the specific time value that gets
set.  We set _last_vol_usage_poll to 0 before calling the function under
test.  We really only need to check that it got set to some value after
calling the function under test.  This tweak should make the test pass
consistently.
