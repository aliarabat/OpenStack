This is because the file resource doesn't properly handle query
parameters in URLs. So we are forced to use an exec resource here. It's
fine if we always trigger the CRL downloading, as that's a file that
gets udpated often.

Also ensure we get proper escaped source/destination for the download.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

Inter Tenant Traffic between two different networks that belong
to two different Tenants is not possible when connected through
a shared network that are internally connected through DVR
routers.

This issue can be seen in multinode environment where there
is network isolation.

The issue is, we have two different IP for the ports that are
connecting the two routers and DVR does not expose the router
interfaces outside a compute and is blocked by ovs tunnel bridge
rules.

This patch fixes the issue by not applying the DVR specific
rules in the tunnel-bridge to the shared network ports that
are connecting the routers.

Currently, we cannot get ACCEPT packet log because there are some
changed related to ovs firewall code since ovs firewall logging has
been merged.

Regarding to performance perspective, we only log first accepted packet.
So we only need to forward first accepted packet of each connection
session to table 91 and table 92.

So this patch fixes these issues.

The method read_tar_image open the image tarfile and read the
manifest.json file inside the tarfile. It used regular expression
to retrieve information from the manifest file. However, the
regular expression cannot handle a corner case that an image
has multiple tags (i.e. cirros:latest and cirros:0.3.4). This
is a reason that our gate failed intermittently.

This commit fixed it. First, use jsonutil to load the manifest
into memory before retrieve information. Second, handle the case
that read_tar_file fails. The container creation should continue
even if it fails to retrieve extra information from the manifest.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

Recently, Keystone renamed ""Member"" role to ""member""
(case-sensitive) with https://review.openstack.org/#/c/572243/14

Case-sensitivity role requirement in Keystone was recently
formalized with https://review.openstack.org/#/c/576640/

From the above reference:

""Role names are case-insensitive. for example, when keystone
bootstraps default roles, it creates `admin`, `member`, and
`reader`. If another role `Member` (note the upper case 'M') is
created, keystone will return a `409` Conflict since it considers
the name ""Member"" == ""member"". Note that case is preserved in these
cases.""

It follows that Tempest should use ""member"" role by default.

On hosts with dvr_snat agent mode, after restarting OVS agent,
sometimes the SNAT port is processed first instead of the distributed port.
The subnet_info is cached locally via get_subnet_for_dvr when either of these ports
are processed. However, it returns the MAC address of the port used to query
as the gateway for the subnet. Using the SNAT port, this puts the wrong
MAC as the gateway, causing some flows such as the DVR flows on br-int
for local src VMs to have the wrong MAC.

This patch fixes the get_subnet_for_dvr with fixed_ips as None for the csnat port,
as that causes the server side handler to fill in the subnet's actual gateway
rather than using the port's MAC.

The Neutron OVS agent logs can get flooded with KeyErrors as the
'_get_port_info' method skips the added/removed dict items if no
ports have been added/removed, which are expected to be present,
even if those are just empty sets.

This change ensures that those port info dict fields are always set.

The Placement API has the concept of resource provider generations to
enable the co-ordination of multiple API clients, so they can avoid
accidentally overwriting each other's updates.

However when we know that a single client writes certain resource
providers then the generation handling becomes an unnecessary extra
API round-trip. Ideally the Placement API would give us a chance to
express our ignorance about multi-client coordination (accepting that
a single client can overwrite its own previous updates).

Until the Placement API gives us such a feature we implement it in
the client lib, by making 'resource_provider_generation' parameters
optional.  This is inferior to the API doing the same because we may
still see GenerationConflict exceptions even when we said
method(..., resource_provider_generation=None).

Later changes for the minimum guaranteed bandwidth
feature need 'resource_provider_generation' to be
optional for 'update_resource_provider_traits' and
'update_resource_provider_inventories'. For the sake of consistency
we do the same to 'update_resource_provider_inventory'.

All other API resources (ie. traits, resource_provider_traits and
resource_provider_inventories) we need to report on for minimum
guaranteed bandwidth have update methods that can be called in one go,
either because they have update-or-create or update-overrides-all
semantics. Here we add the 'ensure_resource_provider' method so
resource providers also have a similarly simple way of being kept in
sync.  We also add 'update_resource_provider' as a pre-requisite. On
the side we also fix a little, silent unit test type error.

Like change Ia584dba66affb86787e3069df19bd17b89cb5c49 which
came before, is port binding fails and we have a ""binding_failed""
vif type in the info cache, we'll fail to plug vifs for an
instance on compute restart which will prevent the service
from restarting. Before the os-vif conversion code, this was
handled with VirtualInterfacePlugException but the os-vif conversion
code fails in a different way by raising a generic NovaException
because the os-vif conversion utility doesn't handle a vif_type of
""binding_failed"".

To resolve this and make the os-vif flow for binding_failed behave
the same as the legacy path, we implement a translation function
in os_vif_util for binding_failed which will make the plug_vifs
code raise VirtualInterfacePlugException which is what the
_init_instance code in ComputeManager is already handling.

Admittedly this isn't the smartest thing and doesn't attempt
to recover / fix the instance networking info, but it at least
gives a more clear indication of what's wrong and lets the
nova-compute service start up. A note is left in the
_init_instance error handling that we could potentially try
to heal binding_failed vifs in _heal_instance_info_cache, but
that would need to be done in a separate change since it's more
invasive.

The older version of pylint being used does not work
correctly under python 3. In order to be able to
update the pylint job to run under python 3,
we need to update the tool.

Aslo fix a couple of pylint issues:

- Fix import order issues.
- Fix 'no-else-return' checks.

Added the following to the blacklist:

- inconsistent-return-statements
- catching-non-exception
- using-constant-test

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

In Pike[1], we introduced a user_group auto detection for haproxy.
The default user group name is auto-detected for any OS distribution
we support as a base for Amphorae.

user_group remained as an option for admins but was also
marked deprecated in Pike[2].

This patch removes that option altogether.

Increase timeout from 180 mins to 200 mins fter observing that 14% of
jobs failed as timeout and others failed in post due to same issue.
This happened with any jobs but a most of them were update ones which
are known to be longer.

At least one update job has an avergage success duration of 10013 secs
which is too close to the cutout. This generated extra failures and
total estimated failure rate due to timeout went ~20%. This translates
to a huge extra load on CI because the only thing a developer would
do is to do a recheck.

Without having a ~10% safety net spare build time, we would would
endup prevent almost any change from going in.

In https://review.openstack.org/493057/ it was noticed that we
had made a mistake in a previous stable branch addition where
we missed setting stable/newton upgrading to stable/ocata. We
were going to follow up with a different patch to fix it, but
did not follow through until now.

This is really of limited use now since newton is EOL, but
making the change for now so it is at least right for any
trailing uses. It will likely just be removed completely
soon.
