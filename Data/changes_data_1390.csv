Currently Nova does not configure any CPU model for libvirt
guests. This is sub-optimal because the default KVM CPU
model has changed a number of times, and more importantly
VMs are not able to take advantage of many performance
features in newer CPUs. To get a consistent CPU model exposed
to the guest and maximize performance of VMs in the cloud,
explicit specification of CPU models per host is desirable.

This change adds a new Nova config flag:

  libvirt_cpu_mode = host-model|host-passthrough|custom

Where

  * host-model == configure a model that matches the features
                  available in the host CPU

  * host-passthrough == passthrough the host CPU precisely
                        with no change at all

  * custom == configure a specific named CPU model

If the 'custom' mode is used, then the additional flag
is available to choose the model:

  libvirt_cpu_model = <one of the names from /usr/share/libvirt/cpu_model.xml>

eg

  libvirt_cpu_model = core2duo

If specifying a custom CPU model, it is wise to choose one that is
capable of running on all the various different Nova hosts in the
cloud. That said, libvirt will enforce compatibility at time of
starting or migrating guests & refuse the operation if required.

If using either the host-model or host-passthrough modes, and use
of live migration is desired, admins should ensure that all hosts
have a homogeneous CPU model. If hosts have a hetergeneous CPU
models, then a custom named CPU model is a better choice

This configuration only works for libvirt >= 0.9.10, due to the
use of the 'mode' attribute on the <cpu> element for configuring
host models.

Commit aa9a592abcbfabad4d2a3f8bb49d1b28d7724262, which renamed
the libvirt module from 'connection' -> 'driver', accidentally
introduced a flaw in the test_connection_to_primitive libvirt
testcase.

The original code in that test case was

   connection = nova.virt.libvirt.connection.LibvirtDriver('')
   jsonutils.to_primitive(connection._conn, convert_instances=True)

Notice how the second line is using the '_conn' attribute on
the LibvirtDriver *object instance*

Now the new code is

   connection = libvirt_driver.LibvirtDriver('')
   jsonutils.to_primitive(libvirt_driver._conn, convert_instances=True)

Notice how the second line is using the '_conn' attribute on
the LibvirtDriver *class*. Predictably this causes the testcase
to fail due to the '_conn' attribute not existing.

The 'delete', 'download', and 'upload' commands use multiple threads
for concurrency. However, the number of threads was hardcoded at
10. This patch simply makes those configurable.

For example, if I'm downloading a lot of files but I don't want to
saturate the downstream on my Internet connection, I might choose to
use only 1 or 2 threads for object downloads. Conversely, if I'm
uploading a lot of small files across a fast network, I would want
lots of threads to speed things along.

The default number of threads is 10, so the default behavior is
unchanged.

In the feature we should use the auth functions from keystoneclient and
be done with those changes, we could then auth by user/tenant-ID.

The previous code provided a '_name' entry in a dict to represent
this, but then appended ""=_name"" to the key rather than populating

This just changes the value in '_name' for public key to be
'0=keyname' rather than 'keyname'.  It makes the rendering simpler by
just using the

This patch speeds up the DB creation process considerably in deployments
with a considerable amount of instances.  It also cleans up a lot of the
code which ends up creating the instance DB record.

The biggest improvement in this patch is removing unnecessary joins in
security_groups DB calls.  This also reduces the number of DB calls
needed to create an instance DB record in general.

Side effect of this patch is the default 'display_name' for an instance
when it (or hostname) is not specified is now 'Server <uuid>' vs
'Server <id>'.  Because of the use of 'id', it required creating the DB
record, then updating the record later after we new the 'id'.  This is
gone.

In Horizon, databases are only used for session storage, for which
there are a few options. The install doc used memcache for the session
 cache, but also asked users to install a MySQL database, which was
unnecessary.

This change creates a new section, based on the horizon developer
docs which explains all of the options for session storage in
OpenStack Dashboard. It moves the redundant MySQL configuration to
that section, and references it in a note.

This change also attempts to improve section-leveling throughout the
chapter.

Patch set 2 fixes a typo (depooyment) and removes a <title> element
from the ch_installdashboard.xml as it caused a duplicate display of
the title text.

This change should avoid the mind-bending associated with knowing
which distro a commenter is commenting about on a single page.

However it also means all old comment threads will not display on
a given page for the install guide.

I'll see what I can do to migrate threads but it does get tricky since
threads-per-page cannot be migrated to two separate pages.

If nova-compute is stopped (either by the process being killed or
the system crashing) then it will forget what tasks it is currently
working on leaving tasks partially done. This patch switches the
XenAPI driver over to being idempotent to allow tasks to be started
again when nova-compute is restarted.

fixes bug 987624
The code sample in ""Getting the API Endpoint URL"" had a number of
errors, such as missing auth node, incorrect use of variables etc
This patch fixes that so it should actually work

Patch set 2 adds auth wrapper to all locations in both the xml and mdown document,
plus fixes a ""you password"" typo.

I think this auth wrapper is needed for Trystack also so ignore my previous comment
about a note needed for diablo v essex clouds.

Patch set 3 fixes the end curly braces (need 3 not 4) and adds a note to address
the empty service catalaog that template-backed clouds return.

Move rootwrap filters definition from being defined within Nova
code to being defined in configuration files to facilitate pluging-in
new rootwrap commands.

Transition notes:
* nova-rootwrap now requires an additional (first) parameter pointing
  to the root-owned rootwrap.conf file, sudoers needs to be updated
  to specify that (""nova-rootwrap /etc/nova/rootwrap.conf *"")
* Packagers should ship {compute,network,volume}.filters inside a
  directory listed in rootwrap.conf rather than shipping
  nova/rootwrap/{compute,network,volume}.py
* Filter definitions now only support strings. The KillFilter (which was
  using arrays as parameters) was modified and the tests updated.

Implements bp nova-rootwrap-pluggable-filters

Corresponding devstack change needs to land first, so that tests pass:

At the Folsom Design Summit, it was decided that infrastructure HA
(high availability of core OpenStack services and some external
services that OpenStack relies on, such as MySQL and RabbitMQ) should
be an overarching goal for Folsom. It was also agreed that a large
portion of that effort would be in documentation rather than
development, because OpenStack should make use of existing high-availability
solutions where available -- rather than reinvent the wheel.

This is the first step toward such a High Availability Guide,
containing a root document, an introduction to HA, and a
pom.xml file to make everything build in Maven.

* no user_home in settings.HORIZON_CONFIG - uses

The recent RPC versioning support introduced some odd behavior if a non-
existent method is called. Instead of reporting that the method does not
exist (as the code used to do, in the form of an AttributeError), it now
Reports ""Unsupported RPC Version"". This is highly confusing, as the RPC
versions *do* match and is just a result of the logic used to check
every advertised RPC proxy for the method.

This patch notes if any of the RPC versions matched the requested one,
and if so, raises an AttributeError if the method is never found,
instead of UnsupportedRpcVersion.

Also add unit tests for the cases where a method is missing, both when
the API version matches and not.

enables timezone support in settings.

The assumption is that the server time should *always* be UTC.

timezone display and add timezone indicators anywhere times are
displayed to the user.

The recent RPC versioning support introduced some odd behavior if a non-
existent method is called. Instead of reporting that the method does not
exist (as the code used to do, in the form of an AttributeError), it now
Reports ""Unsupported RPC Version"". This is highly confusing, as the RPC
versions *do* match and is just a result of the logic used to check
every advertised RPC proxy for the method.

This patch notes if any of the RPC versions matched the requested one,
and if so, raises an AttributeError if the method is never found, instead
of UnsupportedRpcVersion.

Initial commit of Atmos storage adapter. Includes code
for the storage adapter and unit test code

Code allows glance users to specify an EMC Atmos powered
object storage cloud as a repository for glance images.

The code will allow users to upload, download, and delete images.
It leverages Atmos' object space methods to store images in a flat file
system and add an image-id to listable meta-data on the object.

You must configure the glance-api.conf file with your atmos parameters
for the storage solution to work.

Note - This is the first time I have submitted any code, so please be nice ;)

bug 1006120

Ceilometer needs to collect more data for determining the billing rate
for an instance. The most efficient way to get that data is to have it
included in the notifications sent by nova, rather than looking it up
after the notification is received.  This change adds details about the
location, size, and ""type"" of the instance to the existing notification
data. It also organizes the set of values into groups and adds comments
to clarify those groupings.

Move rootwrap filters definition from being defined within Nova
code to being defined in configuration files in a rootwrap.d
directory, to facilitate pluging-in new rootwrap commands.

Transition notes:
* nova-rootwrap now requires an additional (first) parameter pointing
  to the root-owned rootwrap.d directory, sudoers needs to be updated
  to specify that (""nova-rootwrap /etc/nova/rootwrap.d *"")
* Packagers should ship rootwrap.d/{compute,network,volume}.ini rather
  than nova/rootwrap/{compute,network,volume}.py
* Filter definitions now only support strings. The KillFilter (which was
  using arrays as parameters) was modified and the tests updated.

This is step 2 for blueprint folsom-nova-rootwrap. It needs to go
in after https://review.openstack.org/#/c/8524 so that devstack
supports the changes and the tests pass.

Don't not automatically invoke the 'parse_dom' method from
the LibvirtConfigObject constructor, because this is too
early in construction - no child class constructors have
initialized yet.

Instead require the 'parse_dom' method to be invoked after
the bare object has been constructed. Also make the default
impl of 'parse_dom' take an etree.Element instance and
validate its root element name. Add a convenient 'parse_str'
method for turning a XML string into an etree.Element
instance & parsing it.

It appears that the thread serving out the fake HTTP endpoint used
in the copy-from tests is causing intermittent hangs in the launched
glance service processes. These hangs manifest as calls to futex(2)
that never return, and occur almost daily in Smokestack.

The background to the thread/fork mismatch is explained in this
blog post:

 http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2011/06/07/forked

We avoid the issue by delaying the thread creation until after the
service processes have been launched by the testcase.

If disk failure happens while object replication is ongoing,
object-replicator could replicate objects from other nodes to the root
file system.  It is because object-replicator does no mount check
(error check) at all after collect_jobs() is called, and it executes
rsync based on the old partition information in update().

This change prevents many objects from being written to the root file
system wrongly and fixes bug 1014545.

Add support in devstack for upcoming /etc/nova/rootwrap.d
configuration files. Note that we don't change anything if Nova
doesn't ship them, so devstack supports both cases.

This is the first step for blueprint folsom-nova-rootwrap. It needs
to go in first so that tests pass when rootwrap.d changes will be
proposed in Nova.

To support bp:virt-driver-cleanup, there is a desire to have shorter
driver strings (i.e. libvirt.LibvirtDriver instead of
nova.virt.libvirt.LibvirtDriver). One way to support this is with
a new import_object variant that takes a namespace to load from.

If the code fails to load the driver in the prefered namespace it
will also try loading the full driver path, before throwing an
exception.

In a mixed environment of running different CPU architecutres,
one would not want to run an ARM instance on a X86_64 host and
vice versa.

This scheduler filter option will prevent instances running
on a host that it is not intended for.

The libvirt driver queries the guest capabilities of the
host and stores the guest arches in the permitted_instances_types
list in the cpu_info dict of the host.

The Xen equivalent will be done later in another commit.

The arch filter will compare the instance arch against
the permitted_instances_types of a host
and filter out invalid hosts.

Also adds ARM as a valid arch to the filter.

The ArchFilter is not turned on by default.

The changes here are coming as a result of starting on blueprint
config-drive-v2 [1].  I wanted to separate out the ""Metadata"" from the
""Metadata Server"".  Thus, the creation of nova/api/metadata/base.py.

The InstanceMetadata in base.py contains most of the logic for
presenting metadata.  As a result, the Metadata webservice in handler.py
greatly simplified.  This should make it easier to render duplicate
data to a config drive.

Additional changes here:
 * a few more tests
 * removal of the separate 'Versions' handler.  Its now replaced
   by the single handler.

Fixes bug 988596

Change 77495cfe breaks storage manager, as it makes a
wrong assumption about nova-manage. The sr-uuid must be
generated and provided by the xenapi storage manager.

When the volume service is started, SM volume driver will
create a new SR for everything that does not have an
existing sr_uuid and will populate the db with the result.
It will only introduce the SRs that do have one. The introduce
will work only if the uuid provided is something SM understands.

This partially reverts commit 77495cfed17f12f225e11fbc10e0f8db516dadf2.
Changes in db are left intact.

The original migration converts numerical IDs to UUIDs.  It updates
image_members and image_properties that reference image_id, but stops
short of updating actual properties that reference the new UUIDs,
specifically kernel_ids and ramdisk_ids.  This breaks launching
of instances in Nova whos images are associated with a kernel and/or rd.

Also, this fixes an issue when migrating against non-sqlite
databases where the actual conversion is executed twice.

Fixes bug 975651

Update: Only update kernel_ids and ramdisk_ids in image_properties

Fix bug 999698.

nova-compute requested network info for each instance on startup via rpc.
If all services get (re)started at the same time, nova-network may not
be available to take this request, resulting in a lost request.  To
combat this issue, get the network info from the cache in the database
on startup.  If by some chance this information is not correct, it will
get fixed up by a periodic task.

already running.  Before this was only done when first starting dnsmasq.

The logic is pulled from the nova code, but has been abstracted
from being nova specific. It allows us to duplicate less info,
because we know a lot of the meta information in setup.py anyway.

Once this is in, we'll get autodoc module information everywhere
pretty much for free, and we can delete the doc/ext dir and the
doc/*sh from nova. (thanks to bcwaldon for pushing things to be
better)

When a volume has no name, it now shows the
ID instead. I also added a fixture data that
represents such a volume being in the system.

Fixes bug #1012380

You can also now use truncate=i on DataTable
Columns in order to have the value truncated if
it goes beyond i characters.

On top of this I fixed/made-clearer a bunch of
the tests relating to volumes and instances.
Please do NOT use deepcopy() of fixture data
in tests any more, instead just create a new
fixture for the data you want.
