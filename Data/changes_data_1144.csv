The unit tests currently don't require actual `libvirt` to be installed,
allowing them to easily be run on a Mac.

The `test_cpu_monitor` tests, however, indirectly require it by using the
ComputeManager (which imports LibvirtDriver and then `libvirt`).

The fix is to do the same thing we do in the libvirt unit tests, stub out the
modules to point to `fakelibvirt`.

Previously, column references were implemented at compile-time.
Each time a rule was translated from a string to internal data
structures, the column references were compiled away (which required
knowledge of the schema).

This change implements column references at evaluation-time, by
expanding the unifier (which is tricky to get right and involved
a pretty complete rewrite of several unification routines).
It also adds schema consistency checks
during the set_schema event and when the datasource driver policy
is deleted (ensuring no dangling references).  The code to
compile away column references has been preserved.

MORE DETAILS
All of this code is concerned with schema changes.  If we allow
the schema to change, the goal is to minimize the number of cases where
we force a policy change (or equivalently reject the new schema).
A schema change requires two things: (i) checking if
the current policy is consistent with the new schema and (ii) evaluating
with the new schema.

To check for errors, we could reparse (from strings) all the rules with
a new schema in place, but that just seems horrible.  Instead, this change:
1. Changes the compiler so that there is a native representation of
the column-reference rules.  Adds checks for schema consistency when
the schema changes (when a datasource driver is deleted and when
the set_schema event occurs).

To evaluate using the new schema, there are 2 options, both of which
build on top of (1).
2. Compile away column references for those rules that require recompilation
based on the schema change.
3. Change unifier to handle column references directly.

This change includes the code for (1), (2), and (3), but takes approach (3)
instead of (2).  (Nevertheless, the building blocks for (2) are included: to check if
the schema is consistent with a rule, we compile-away the col-refs and
either succeed or error out.)  (3) was added at the last minute, and despite
thorough testing of the pieces, the change as a whole hasn't been tested.

This code was never merged since it was more complex than expected,
we hit a deadline, and it is unclear whether this is the right approach to
handling schema changes.  The test coverage should be pretty good.

Live migration fails for volume backed instances in LibvirtDriver
because _is_shared_block_storage() incorrectly identifies volume
backed disks as local. This is fixed by passing the block_device_info
parameter to get_instance_disk_info, which allows for correct
filtering of volume backed disks.

We use metaquery as a parameter of db func, and valid keys include
db func parameters.

When we parse query filters, the metadata dict is stored as key named
metaquery in kwargs, and we store q.field=foo as key named foo in kwargs.
Then if q.field=metaquery, the kwargs will get the key metaquery but
its type is something, for i.e. string, but not dict. However the db
func expects metaquery to be a dict but gets a string, then 500 is returned

This patch returns a 400 error for such case, and removes 'metaquery'
from valid keys in error message to avoid misleading end user.

This is a follow-on from a previous commit which added recon info

Here, the ""--drievaudit"" option is added to swift-recon tool. This

We have to use `archive` name in APT pinning because `suite` is actually
an archive name. For instance, the following upstream Ubuntu repo

    deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates main

has the following attributes in APT pinning

    a=trusty-updates, n=trusty, c=main

Obviously, it's wrong to use `n=` (codename) for matching suite.

Besides this, since now we're generating a few pinnings for the source
like

    deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main restricted

because the following line

    a=trusty, c=main, c=restricted

will apply pinning only for the `restricted` section.

This commit adds support for single-range GET requests to
erasure-coded objects. A single-range GET request is a request with a
single byte-range in its Range header.

Examples:
  * Range: bytes=10485760-15728640
  * Range: bytes=1048576-
  * Range: bytes=-8192

This is sufficient to make SLO and DLO ranged-GET requests work.

Note that multi-range GET requests are supported for replicated
objects, but not yet for erasure-coded objects. Such support will be
forthcoming in a future commit.

For reference, multi-range GET requests have Range headers with more
than one byte-range.

Examples:
  * Range: bytes=4096-8191,1048576-2097152
  * Range: 100-200,-300

These are much less common than single-range requests, but for feature
parity with replicated objects, Swift will end up supporting them for
erasure-coded objects as well. Just not now.

In case user deletes empty cluster through api, action log is not updated
for cluster_deletion task as orm related error occurs in updating routine.
The reason for it is that we try to operate on task instance which
corresponding row was removed from db and hence attempt to access
attributes, marked on model as deffered, produces mentioned error.

This patch wraps getting of task.cache attribute into separate
try..except block in which case we only lose update for ""output"" section
of additional_info for action_log entry.

Unit test for implemented task helper routine, modeling situation with
referring to ""deffered"" attribute of instance, which corresponding db row
was deleted, added.

Integration test that emulates user's action leading to the bug added.

Important features:
- Nova client with microversion support is required.
- Nova API server may not support microversion 2.3 (not tested).
- Attaching volumes are not displayed in an instance bdm. Because Cinder
volume doesn't yet contain attachment info (which contains a device
name), and Nova instance volumes_attached doesn't contain a device name
(mountpoint). But a bdm must contain it.

Other features:
- v2.3 is requested always
- RunInstance result is formatted w/o extra v2.3 info, so it doesn't
contain rootDeviceName and other such info
- if rootDeviceName property is empty it's omitted instead of
to report fake /dev/sda1 as Nova EC2 does it. This leads to omit
rootDeviceType property in this case as well.
Also the same is done for corresponding image's properties.
- deleteOnTermination volume property is omitted for volume at all, and
for instance bdm if Nova doesn't report it. Previously this volume
property contained 'False' only.
- DescribeVolumes isn't used in DescribeInstances (as opposed to
DescribeNetworkInterfaces), because both methods require actual state
of corresponding OS objects, so we prevent duplication of OS requests.
- Not merged Nova client is used
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/152569/

Also:
- fix multi-run instances for EC2 Classic mode
- safe getting of OS instance security groups
- ec2context module alias is renamed to ec2_context, as it is in other
code
- fakes.CinderVolume is renamed to local standard OSVolume
- fakes.OSInstance it transformed to be initialized from a dictionary,
as it is for other fakes.OSXxx objects
- fix code style

On Debian systems, we require upstream to *not* want upstream
to add a debian folder on their upstream code. This goes against
all the worflows we have for maintaining packages inside a specific
branch which contains that debian folder.

As I am about to package Barbican in Debian (reminder: I'm the
package maintainer for everything else in OpenStack in Debian), I
need this folder to go away, so I can do my packaging work. I
certainly appreciate to have a template package to start with though,

Part of multi-patch set for easier chunks.

There have been quite a few instances found where the
i18n guidelines are not being followed. I believe this
has helped lead to some of the confusion around how to
correctly do this. Other developers see this code and
assume it is an example of the correct usage.

This patch attempts to clean up most of those violations
in the existing codebase to hopefully help avoid some of
that confusion in reviews.

Some issues address:
* Correct log translation markers for different log levels
* Passing format values as arguments to call, not preformatting
* Not forcing translation via six.text_type and others

Guidelines can be found here:
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.i18n/guidelines.html

Hacking checks will not be able to identify all violations of
the guidelines, but it could be useful for catching obvious ones
such as LOG.info(""No markers!"").

The test_list_availability_zones_enabled_service test calls
a method which returns a tuple that is generated from a dict.
This is compared to a tuple in the test, which can fail when
PYTHONHASHSEED is not 0, due to the tuples containing elements
in different orders.  (Because the dict used to build the tuple
was ordered differently.)

For this test, we can convert to lists and sort them to do the
comparison, since the ordering is not important.

Without this patch, openstackclient has no way to specify to which
project a network belongs upon creation. Instead, it uses the project
ID that the user is authenticating with to fill the tenant_id column.
This is a problem because an admin user is unable to specify a project
for a non-admin network. To fix this and to improve feature parity with
the neutron client, this patch adds project and domain parameters to
the network create command and uses the given project name to look up
the project ID.

Neutron does not allow the project to be changed after creation, so no
such parameter has been added to the neutron set command.

Neutron calls the field 'tenant_id', but this change exposes the
parameter as '--project' to support the newer terminology.

If no project is specified, the client defaults to the previous
behavior of using the auth project.

The major change here is that httpretty is removed from test_resource in
favor of using a Mock session based off of the Session class.

Common replacements were:
* stub_url usage was replaced with a Mock return_value on the verb that
  was being stubbed.
* Places where we were accessing httpretty.last_request use some form of
  call_args on session verbs. Additionally, for the common case of
  checking whether an expected URL was generated to be called,
  assertCalledURL was created on the ResourceTests class.
* Some minor rearrangements to move several test methods out of TestFind
  and back into ResourceTests where they belong.

When using the websso feature in keystone, the identity provider is
looked up based on the value of the 'remote_id_attribute' environment

searched for against the 'remote_id' field in the backend where identity
providers are stored. Instead, we are doing the lookup against the 'id'
field.

When revert-resize call is finished, it doesn't clear instance
files from destination node for non-shared instance storage.

The driver call, which is responsible for destroying destination
host instance is not deleting instance files, because it finds that
both source and destination host shares the same instance storage.

The check_instance_shared_storage rpc-call had no host information,
hence the manager call for check_instance_shared_storage was checking
instance storage on destination host itself and returning True even
if it is non-shared storage.

Added host parameter to check_instance_shared_storage rpc-call,
so that in manager call check_instance_shared_storage method get
executed on source compute node and returns True/False based on
shared/non-shared storage.

Depending upon how the chef-client is envoked, it does a
STDOUT.tty? check to determine if output should be sent to
the doc formatter as STDOUT.  In many cases this check returns
false.  To override this, I added the --force-formatter option
to the chef-client so we can always get the output to STDOUT.

A data volume container is far superior to bind mounting the
host's shared directories.  It preserves the idempotency,
immutability and declarative properties of the containers.

The way this works in practice is that a data volume container is
created.  Then when the containers start they use LVM to access
the filesystem where /var/lib/docker is contained.  Then the
container startup logic bindmounts the data volume stored on the
host filesystem in /var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/ID.  This prevents
people with access to the host operating system from damaging
the contents of the data container.

It does mean that now we must use tools/stop to stop our containers
rather than tools/cleanup-containers -f.

This is a containers best practice.  For more details see:

https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/

Big credit goes to Danyeon Hansen for seeding this idea in the
mariadb containers.

Note occasionally docker-compose start/stop seems to not want to stop
a container.  This bug needs to be addressed upstream separately
from our utilization of this best practice.

The media.py file is used to attach the config drive to the VM via a
virtual optical media.  Initially, the code required a single static
Virtual I/O Server that it could connect to.

However, PowerVM systems support multiple Virtual I/O Servers.  In case
one is offline, the code should simply move over to the other Virtual
I/O Server (if there is one or more available).

This change supports this scenario.  Changes because of this:
 - Removed the need for the vio_map to be passed into the media.py
 - Used static variables to significantly reduce the overhead of
   validation.
 - Consolidated the CreateCfgDrive and ConnectCfgDrive tasks into a
   single method.  This was required to maintain VIO precision upon the
   scsi mapping.

This is problematic as the user doesn't expect that.

Further more, we can't can't catch ReferenceError and ignore since the
underlying callback might throw that and there is no way to

By using a weakref.ref() object we have a concrete stage were we get the

We use uWSGI mules for this task. This is because on scale lab we have timeout
errors which are reported like this:

DEBUG - Uuuups https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1384623 again

Thus the idea to offload most of the work done in this handler to an
asynchronous worker (uWSGI mule in this case). Note that increasing uWSGI
workers count doesn't help -- timeouts for this specific request will still
occur, we would only have the advantage of not blocking the API so much.

Other suggestions were made:
- use receiverd -- this has the disadvantage of breaking current flow of
  messages which is something like Nailgun -> Astute -> receiver
  (we would have in this case: Nailgun -> receiver -> Astute -> receiver
  which is not intuitive)
- use Celery -- this is a big change and not a bad idea for the future
  but we would like to have this merged for the 6.1 release, mules are at
  hand already
- performance improvements -- this is not that easy too (as noted in the

Refactors diskfile.py to implement policy-type-specific
diskfile behavior in diskfile (sub-)classes.

This patch creates policy type specific diskfile
classes to allow some inheritance and overriding
of get_ondisk_files and hash_cleanup_listdir.

Also moves the file name mangling methods
from storage_policy.py to diskfile.py (ts_to_fname
and fname_to_ts). IMHO that is the right place for them
since they are diskfile-implementation choices and the new
classes added provide a better home for them.

The `execute_tasks` method was designed to execute some abstract tasks
sent by Nailgun. Hence, in the end of execution if all is ok it sends
the ""ready"" status back to Nailgun. It's wrong in case of pre_provision
tasks, because they don't mean provisioning is done.

Since this commit we're running pre_provision tasks by means Nailgun
Hooks and therefore do not report ""ready"" when they are done.

The high points:
- Moved trigger_id from assembly to plan in datamodels
- Added an internal method to find assemblies by plan
- Moved trigger_uri generation to plan
- Moved trust_id from assembly to plan in datamodels
- Renamed tools/trigger-assembly.py to trigger-app.py
- Deploy, if successful, should destroy (soon, just shutdown)
  other assemblies

The low points:
- ED WHERE ARE YOUR TESTS MAN NOTHING WORKS
- SERIOUSLY YOU DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH THE TESTS
- shell_nobuild doesn't use deployer, so deployer doesn't
  remove old assemblies
- A lot of code was shamelessly teleported to plan_handler
  from assembly_handler, mostly to reduce the complexity of
  these changes. See how well that worked!
- Yes, plan_handler makes use of an assembly_handler. I'm not
  sure if that's the best way to do it, but it's worked well
  enough for most of my attempts!

This feature provides the query.update_on_match()
and query.update_returning_pk() methods, as well
as the manufacture_persistent_object(),
manufacture_entity_criteria(), and manufacture_criteria()
utility functions.

query.update_on_match() is used to UPDATE a row based on a variety
of criteria, and to then return a fully persistent object
state representing the row that was matched.  It
essentially intends to provide an UPDATE that is guaranteed
to have matched a specific row in the presence of potential
race conditions without using any locking, and to then
return a record of that row as if it had been SELECTed.

query.update_returning_pk() is a public method that
also serves as part of the implementation of
query.update_on_match(); this method delivers an UPDATE
statement such that the primary key of the single row
matched is returned; if zero or multiple rows are matched,
and error is raised.   To handle this, several backend-specific
strategies are provided, which are automatically selected
based on the best available.  The lowest strategy
performs a re-SELECT, but still assumes there's
a simple unique column to be queried on, as is currently the
use case in Nova (uuid is present).  On Postgresql, MySQL
and other databases besides SQLite and possibly DB2, more
atomic strategies are used.

Currently the in-process tests build a 2 replica, 4 partition,
2 device object ring. This patch allows an alternative policy
and ring to be specified for testing via environment variables
that may optionally be set.

SWIFT_TEST_IN_PROCESS_CONF_DIR - This points the test setup to a
  directory which may have a swift.conf file and ring file. The
  test setup will then prefer these conf files over the samples
  in '/etc'.

SWIFT_TEST_POLICY - This causes the in-process test to
  use the specified policy from the swift.conf file and its
  associated ring for testing (first copying the conf and ring file
  and modifying device parameters to suit in-process testing). If
  not set, the tests will use the default policy.

The in-process tests now start sufficient object servers for the
ring file being tested against.

This should allow in-process functional testing of various policies
and rings (e.g. EC policies) without needing to reconfigure an SAIO
for each test scenario.

The refactoring of the in_process test setup code should also
allow easier addition of other 'hard-coded' test policies/rings
in the future.

With the introduction of microversions, node fields that are added in
a particular (micro)version should not be made visible to requests
for older versions. This patch puts the logic for handling this for
all such new fields in one method: hide_fields_in_newer_versions().

This should make it easier for developers to know where to add code,
and will (hopefully) prevent multiple methods from popping up for
each new set of fields.

This also removes the exception handling in allow_logical_names()
because it is not needed, since it is no longer being called in a
method where a pecan.request might not be available (eg, when
generating a sample of a Node for the documentation).

Add first test for patching environment, which
deploys some cluster and apply patches on it.
Environment configuration (deployment test) is chosen
automatically based on packages tags.
Tests require errata.yaml which should include scenarios
for applying/verifying patches.
Additional variables required by patching tests:
 * PATCHING_MIRRORS - list of repositories with patched
   packages;
 * PATCHING_WEB_DIR - directory on master node which is
   available via HTTP (used for new repository);
 * PATCHING_BUG_ID - bug ID which is going to be fixed;
 * PATCHING_PKGS_TESTS - local path or URL to destination
   where test plans for packages are stored;
 * PATCHING_APPLY_TESTS - local path or URL which should
   be used to get test plans for bugs (using bug ID);
 * PATCHING_PKGS - list of patched packages; if empty -
   list is gotten from test plan (errata.yaml) or from
   repository.

This change adds a prepare_test_env.sh script which builds a
heat_integrationtests.conf using the iniset function from devstack.

prepare_test_env.sh can be run locally with appropriate credentials
and a valid $DEST. In the gate post_test_hook.sh runs prepare_test_env.sh
with sudo so it has the required permissions to write
heat_integrationtests.conf.

Instead of adding more environment variables which are used as default
config options, replace those by actually writing out a
heat_integrationtests.conf file with the required values. This was always
the original intention - it just hadn't been done yet.

The exception to this is the sourced auth environment variables which
are very convenient to not have to state explicitly in the config file.
