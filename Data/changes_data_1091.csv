This was sort of an anti-pattern anyway. You can't really depend on
something that's optional. If the need for something like this arises we
should look into established patterns like: template, decorator and
chain of responsibility. I believe that one or a combination of those
could have been used instead of the original implementation.

When overload was on and in use, the ring builder was unnecessarily
moving partitions. It would converge on a good solution and settle
down eventually, but it moved more partitions than necessary along the
way.

There are three partition gatherers used in the ring builder:
dev-removed, dispersion, and weight, in that order. The dev-removed
gatherer will pick up all partitions on removed devices. The
dispersion gatherer picks up replicas of partitions that are
suboptimally dispersed. The weight gatherer picks up partitions on
devices which are overweight.

The weight gatherer was not overload-aware, so it would pick up
partitions that did not need to move. Consider a device that would
normally have 100 partitions assigned, assume we set overload to 0.1
so that this device will hold up to 110 (10 extra) for the sake of
dispersion, and assume the device actually has 104 partitions assigned
to it. The correct behavior is to gather nothing from this device
because it has fewer than the maximum. Prior to this commit, the
weight gatherer would remove 4 partitions from this device; they would
subsequently be reassigned by the overload-aware partition placer
(_reassign_parts()). In a ring with multiple overloaded devices, the
builder would pick up some partitions from each, shuffle them, and
then assign them back to those same devices. Obviously, this just
created extra replication work for no benefit.

Now, the weight gatherer takes overload into account, and will no
longer needlessly gather partitions.

That's not all, though; this change worsened the behavior of a ring
with more overload than necessary. Before, the ring would balance as
best it could, using the minimal amount of overload. With the
weight-gatherer change, the ring builder will stop gathering
partitions once a device reaches its maximum-permissible assignment
including overload.

For example, imagine a 3-replica, 4-zone ring with overload=0.2 and
weights:

  z1: 100
  z2: 60
  z3: 60
  z4: 60

Since z1 has more than 1/3 of the weight, z2, z3, and z4 must take
more than their fair share for the sake of dispersion.

Now, turn up the weights some:

  z1: 100
  z2: 80
  z3: 80
  z4: 80

Overload is no longer needed; this ring can balance. However, z2, z3,
and z4 would end up keeping more than their fair share since (a) they
already had extra due to earlier conditions, and (b) the weight
gatherer won't pick up partitions from them since they're not
overburdened once it takes overload into account.

To fix this, we compute the minimum overload factor required for
optimal dispersion and then use min(user-input-overload,
minimum-overload) during rebalance. This way, we don't overload
devices more than the user says, but if the user sets overload higher
than necessary, we'll still give the best balance possible.

This is a tool to help developers quantify changes to the ring
builder. It takes a scenario (JSON file) describing the builder's
basic parameters (part_power, replicas, etc.) and a number of
""rounds"", where each round is a set of operations to perform on the
builder. For each round, the operations are applied, and then the
builder is rebalanced until it reaches a steady state.

The idea is that a developer observes the ring builder behaving
suboptimally, writes a scenario to reproduce the behavior, modifies
the ring builder to fix it, and references the scenario with the
commit so that others can see that things have improved.

I decided to write this after writing my fourth or fifth hacky one-off
script to reproduce some bad behavior in the ring builder.

Split the validate process into two distinct parts. The fetch process
will retrieve the token data, either from PKI or from the identity
server. It is also responsible for caching this information.

The validate process then looks at the data returned and decides whether
it is allowed for this request. A simplification for later is that token
binding is performed in addition to the validate step because this
really should be performed once per request and not once per token.

Because of this we are no longer caching the validation of a request,
only the actual request data. We therefore remove some tests that were
testing that the validation of a token was cached.

In OpenStack, to comply with security standards, it was necessary to
audit the operations performed by a cloud administrator or a tenant user
on OpenStack components.
OpenStack Icehouse release, in the form of the blueprint explained at
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ceilometer/blueprints/
support-standard-audit-formats
has introduced WSGI middleware ""Audit Filter"" for each project to listen to
incoming API requests and generate audit notifications in the Cloud Auditing
Data Federation (CADF) format. These audit notifications are eventually
transported using an audit notifier over the Notification Bus.
Audit Event Listener collects these notifications from the Notification Bus
and forwards them as events on the Event Bus to which the Ceilometer
Collector is registered.
The Ceilometer Collector stores these CADF events in a Data Store
like MongoDB.
Although this information is stored in the Ceilometer datastore, there is
no way currently for Ceilometer to either view, or filter this data either
in Horizon UI or Ceilometer CLIs.

The current blueprint proposes to enhance the Horizon UI and Ceilometer CLI
to view and filter CADF events.

As part of the work to allow VPN functionals job to run when Neutron
commits are reviewed, we need to be more intelligent about how
dependencies are resolved in the tox.ini for this repo.

This commit does the same as LBaaS, using a script to determine whether
an existing Neutron repo exists (and use that for a Neutron patch-set
running the VPN tests) or whether the Neutron repo needs to be cloned
(for a VPN patch set).

With the VPN repo, the rootwrap config file and filters need to be set
up. The deploy_rootwrap script is modified to do all actions related to
setup, instead of doing part of that in tox.ini, as before. In addition,
rootwrap config and needed filters for testing from Neutron are added to
this repo, so there is no dependency on Neutron (whose location cannot
be assumed in the gate).

NOTE: To run functional tests locally, one needs to set VENV for the
desired functional target and invoke configure_vpn_for_func_testing.sh.
Next, run tox for the functional target with --notest to setup the
virtual environment. Then, install Neutron into the virtual env. Finally,
the functional test can then be invoked.

This must be upstreamed, before allowing the VPN functional job to run
for Neutron jobs.

Changed inheritance chain for NeutronDbPluginV2 to allow switching from

IpamNonPluggableBackend methods are called on it's instance,
instead of previous way where IpamNonPluggableBackend was parent for
NeutronDbPluginV2.
It allows switching IPAM implementation in set_ipam_backend

The freezer scheduler is to be executed
as daemon process on the client machines

It has the following responsibilities:

    - download the list of jobs from the api
    - schedule the jobs for execution
    - launch the freezer client at the scheduled time
    - collect metadata and exit codes and upload them to the api
    - periodically poll the api for new/updated jobs
    - if a job is part of a session (a coordinated group of jobs)
      it updates the session status when job starts/stops

  * when not using the api
    - load jobs configurations from files
    - schedule the jobs for execution
    - launch the freezer client at the scheduled time

The freezer scheduler can also be used to manage jobs
and sessions using the following positional parameters:

  job-list
  job-get
  job-create
  job-delete
  job-start
  job-stop
  session-list
  session-get
  session-create

The first is the change in allowed values for assert_has_calls -
https://github.com/testing-cabal/mock/issues/263

The second is a yet unsolved bug around the use of autospec
https://github.com/testing-cabal/mock/issues/264

The skip is because something has changed with mock.open that is
causing the vhduils test to fail. We don't know why, but it's one test
to skip.

This also includes a brute force fix for tox -e docs, because pip is
no longer respecting the sphinx pin in test requirements. This has to
be landed with the other changes because they won't work without it.

Currently, nothing prevents the port status to be changed to BUILD
state when get_device_details() is sent by a host that doesn't own
the port.
In some cases the port might stay in BUILD state.
This could happen during a live-migration, or for multi-hosted ports
such as HA ports.
This commit allows the port status modification only if the port
is bound to the host that is asking for it.

Use oslo_db helper that will allow to restart the whole
transaction in case it needs a certain operation to be repeated.
This is a workaround for the REPEATABLE READ problem where
retrying logic will not work because queries inside a transation
will not see updates made by other transactions.
So, run every attempt in a separate transaction.

Current L3 agents can support more than one
external network when configured properly.

On DVR routers, router-gateway-set was
returning a 500 error, when two external
networks were configured in the system.

The problem resides in the scheduler where the
bind_router is called twice when the
reschedule_router is called from update_router.

The _schedule_router binds the snat
and the qrouter with the respective agents.

But after scheduling it does not return agent.

And in the case of two external networks, the
get_candidates always returns a valid candidate
to be processed and hence the bind_router is
called twice.

This patch fixes the _schedule_router function
and hence avoids the multiple calls to
bind_router.

This prevents the update_router from failing
and causing the nested rollback for the
transactions.

- uses ansible modules where possible rather than using the ansible

- forces ansible command to return true where necessary (we introduce
  new ansible host groups in kilo and these groups do not yet have

- updates the python code to keep is_metal configurations between
  juno and kilo deployments (kilo defaults is_metal=true for

There are encrypted volume tests in Tempest which are passing
in the ceph job but the encryption providers in nova (luks and
cryptsetup) are not actually being called in nova because the
'encrypted' key isn't being set in connection_info for the Rbd
volume driver, and nova is keying off that value to determine
if it needs to run it's encryption providers.

So the tests are passing in the ceph job but it's a total false
positive and the API should actually fail - either the cinder
API to create the encrypted volumes if the Rbd volume driver in
Cinder doesn't support encryption, or the volume attach call in
nova if it can't encrypt the connected volume, either way the
test should fail until that support is baked into nova.

I'm not aware of any kind of 'supports_encryption' or 'encryptable'
capability flag for cinder volume drivers, but that might be
needed for the volume create API to fail if trying to create a
volume from an encrypted volume type where the volume driver
itself doesn't support encryption - but maybe it's only a nova
problem since nova has the encryption providers.

This is fixed generically in the VolumeManager's
initialize_connection method where we check for the encrypted
flag being set in the volume driver method and if not, the
manager sets it based on the volume.encryption_key_id value.
We do this globally since there are other volume drivers besides
rbd that aren't setting the encrypted key in connection_info,
but we test rbd in the gate via the ceph job so most of the
bug tracking is around validation of the ceph job.

This makes the evacuate process leave a record in the database about the
evacuation, and from what host it was being performed. Now, the compute
manager will use that breadcrumb trail to decide whether it should delete
locally-running instances, instead of just the hostname mismatch.

Since this does a query by migration_type, I added a unit test to the

Since property names are often lowercase strings (like 'find' or
'environment'), it can be very hard to distinguish a
property name from general exception information in the
error message (especially for someone new to MuranoPL).
This commit improves this situation, by explicitly highlighting
(quoting) the property in question.

Implicit yaml tag resolver being registered for YaqlYamlLoader (which is
user to load MuranoPL classes as YAML documents with embedded YAQL
statements) was being registered in the default YAML Dumper which is
used for any YAML serialization.

This was leading to inability to load more then one HOT-based package
per API service lifetime: the first package which was uploaded was
causing the leakage of YAQL statements into the global tag resolver.
This global resolver was used for all subsequent load attempts, so plain
yaml documents with Heat templates were attempted to be loaded as
MuranoPL classes.

This patch fixes this behavior by registering the implicit resolver
without helper method (which actually registers the resolvers at default
Dumper).

The HOT-to-MuranoPL converter did not support some types for Heat
Template's input parameters.
Type 'comma_delimited_list' was not supported at all which was leading
to unhandled exceptions during package import operation.
Type 'json' was suported, but the generated UI definition did not
contain 'type' attribute for appropriate field, which was leading to
unhadled exceptions when the UI form was about to be displayed.

Also adds support for boolean type, adds .bool() to boolean field
contracts and adds 'boolean' UI type during UI translation.

This patch fixes these issues.

This commit removes any mention of table field from dynamic_ui and
removes floppyforms from requirements.

'table' field was introduced for MsSqlClusterServer service, that
changed significantly since then and does not use table field anymore.
See
https://github.com/murano-project/murano-app-incubator/blob/master/io.murano.windows.SqlServerCluster/UI/ui.yaml
for more details (even though the repository is deprecated).

Since no app available today uses this type of field, and no tests exist
for this type of field. There is no way to test, that it works correctly,
therefore it is very hard to transfer critical parts from floppyforms to
murano-dashboard.

'table' field depends on django-floppyforms, which is not
present in global-requirements, which is problematic and prevents us
from enabling proposal bot in murano-dashboard.

'table' field was never documented, so no documentation change is
required.

The HOT-to-MuranoPL converter did not support some types for Heat
Template's input parameters.
Type 'comma_delimited_list' was not supported at all which was leading
to unhandled exceptions during package import operation.
Type 'json' was suported, but the generated UI definition did not
contain 'type' attribute for appropriate field, which was leading to
unhadled exceptions when the UI form was about to be displayed.

Also adds support for boolean type, adds .bool() to boolean field
contracts and adds 'boolean' UI type during UI translation.

This patch fixes these issues.

This patch adds possibility to re-raise on client's side exception, that
was raised on server side - serialize it on server side, restore and
re-raise on client.
Allowed to pass `allowed_remote_exmods` parameter from impl_zmq to
CallRequest class

Functional test CallTestCase.test_exception() passes now, so added it to
tox.ini. Modified zmq_receiver to be able run functional tests.

using the futurist codebase and using a greenthread pool

to be done when attaching additional volumes to a running instance.

This patch exposes it on the ComputeDriver base class and makes sure
that it will be called by the compute manager (and that an appropriate

This patch implements these parts of the blueprint:

1) Adds a new resource keystone::resource::authtoken - this manages
keystone authentication for other puppet modules by managing the
[keystone_authtoken] section in the config.  Encapsulating the
authentication configuration in this resource will ensure that we
will be able to support the several new types of authentication coming
in current and future Keystone releases.  This supports all of the
authentication options specified at:
http://www.jamielennox.net/blog/2015/02/17/loading-authentication-plugins/

The username and project_name can be passed in with domain, as
""username::domainname"" or ""project::domainname"".  The resource will strip
off the domain part and use it for the user_domain_name or
project_domain_name if no other domain is specified.

policy._build_match_rule() uses the

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems
with those library releases.

Implements: blueprint api-v3-support

This patch implements these parts of the blueprint:
1) Implements the domain aware keystone_user_role resource.
With Keystone v3, you can assign a role to a user on a domain
or a project/tenant.  e.g.

  assign role 'admin' to user 'admin' for domain 'services'
  assign role 'admin' to user 'admin' for project 'services'

That is, domain and project are mutually exclusive - you cannot
assign a role for both a domain and a project at the same time.
Accepts a 'username@thing' name/title in the following formats::

    username@project
    username::userdomain@::domain
    username::userdomain@project::projectdomain
    username::userdomain@project

et. al. other combinations.  Use the @::domain to assign a role
for a domain.   Use the short names wherever possible, when you are
absolutely sure that there is only 1 user or project with the given
name.  For example, if you are absolutely sure that there is only 1
user named 'glance' in all domains, and only 1 project named 'services'
in all domains, you can use 'glance@services' as the user role name.
Otherwise, you will have to use the domain qualifier ::domain to
distinguish 'glance::domain1' from 'glance::domain2'.
Note that the user id and project id must be used when assigning
a role for a user for a project for the role add and role delete
commands, which is why #create, #destroy, and #roles= have to look
up the user and project ids (via the convenience #properties method).

Adds a script which can be run periodically to generate an image.exists

-  active images that were created before or during the audit period
-  images that were active but were deleted during the audit period.
To determine if an image was or is active, we check if its location is
set and that its created_at/deleted_at values are in the audit period.

The statement buffer previously mangled the AST to produce chunks
that were passed, in isolation, to the node visitor. This caused
some tests to become impossible, if the needed data from two chunks
had been separated. This change fixes things by allowing the
node_visitor to process the AST directly.

To make this work it was necessary to embellish the AST with a few
extra bits of data, a node parent and sibling. This is a none
destructive change that does not limit any of the testing potential
of bandit compared to the raw AST (indeed it enhances it).
As a beneficial side effect, ""nosec"" comments can now be used to
skip entire chunks of code, not just lines, for example

try:
 ...
except: #nosec
 ...

will now skip everything in except block.

If the user specifies a domain other than 'Default', class keystone
will create that domain, and write the id of the domain to the
[identity] default_domain_id parameter in keystone.conf, using the
keystone_domain { is_default => true } resource.

2) Allows user to specify a separate service domain for service accounts
One of the use cases for v3 is the ability to have the service account
keystone_user resources (e.g. glance, cinder, etc.) to be in a separate
domain from the regular user accounts.  keystone::roles::admin allows
to specify this domain.

As per bug discussion, conntrackd is actually not needed for netfilter
framework, and given that users do not appear to find the logs useful
(the only reason we're using conntrackd), let's just remove it.

This commit also defines a variable container_remove_packages so that
the list of packages to remove from containers can be added to in the
future.

NOTE: removing conntrackd does not unload the kernel conntrack modules
or disable the netfilter conntrack framework. It simply means we are not
gathering ostensibly useless logging. The kernel conntrack flows can
still be interrogated with the 'conntrack' userspace cli tool, for real
time debugging.

wait_for_image_status of compute client just calls the one of waiters
module and the method is a wrapper.
So the method seems redundant and it doesn't fit as service clients.

This patch removes wait_for_image_status from compute client and
replaces it with waiters' one.

Partially implements blueprint consistent-service-method-names

   Sorts JavaScript files in `js_files` into source files, mock files
   and spec files based on file extension.

   Output:
   * sources: source files for production.  The order of source files
     is significant and should be listed in the below order:
     - First all the files that defines application's angular module.
       Those files have extension of `.module.js`.  The order among them
       is not significant.
     - Followed by all other source code files.  The order among them
       is not significant.

   * mocks: mock files provide mock data/services for tests.  They have
     extension of `.mock.js`. The order among them is not significant.

   * specs: spec files for testing.  They have extension of `.spec.js`.
     The order among them is not significant.

3) discover_static_files(base_path, sub_path=''):
   Discover static files in given paths, returns JavaScript sources,
   mocks, specs and HTML templates files grouped in lists.

Implements: blueprint api-v3-support

This patch implements these parts of the blueprint:
1) Implements the domain aware keystone_user resource.
Adds support for a :domain property of a user, and allows
the domain to be specified as ""name::domain"" in the :name property.
The new code tries to use the id as much as possible, since it is
the id that uniquely identifies the user among all of
the domains, and using id means that name + domain are not required.
The use of openstack project and role has changed somewhat because
the command line arguments and output are different in v3.
openstack user create --project $project does _not_ add the user
as a member of $project, so that must be done explicitly in
keystone_user.create in order not to break existing manifests that
expect that behavior.

With the addition of NNHA in Kilo, Oozie continued to be pointed at only
one namenode's IP. This change directs EDP jobs to the nameservice,
which defaults to the cluster's name as sent to HDP.

As it is intended primarily for backport, to allow Sahara's EDP to
function in the NNHA case, this change takes a minimal-path approach to
resolving this issue, which can be supplemented or replaced by a more
robust solution for nameservice configuration and load balancing for all
components as time permits.

33e3d4c6b9e0b11500fe47d861110be1c1981572 drops device names - at the
time of writing, the idea was that Nova should collect all the block
device information and decide on device names with the help of the
hypervisor.

It turns out that as well meaning as that change was - it also removed
the ability to do some of the things that the EC2 API needs device names
for (see the linked bug for a more detailed explanation). An example is
overriding some of the attributes of a block device entry in the image.

The only ""indexable"" property of a block device from EC2 POV is device
name so we need to put it back even though they may be overriden by the
virt layer upon a successful intance boot.

This patch adds a new tripleo::noop class that can be
used to help switch all resources of a given type
to noop mode. The class does this via Puppet resource
collectors to enable the noop metaparam on all resources
of the specified type.

When a resource is in noop mode no action
will get taken (however puppet stdout will log information
about what would happen if noop were removed).

The motivation for this patch is to be able to do something
like this and run puppet to configure select resources
(like only config files):

 class {'tripleo::noop':
   file => false
 }

It is important to note that when tripleo::noop is used all common
resources default to noop mode.

This could be used alongside docker containers to provide
a mechanism to pre-configure all related config files for
a set of docker containers ahead of time.

Currently, termination of WSGI application or RPC server immediately stops
service and so interrupts in-progress request.

Graceful handler for SIGTERM signal was added.
SIGINT signal handler was removed to allow instantaneous termination of

DocImpact: graceful termination of process can be done by sending SIGTERM
signal to parent WSGI process. Graceful termination is not instantaneous.
To force instantaneous termination SIGINT signal must be sent.

(cherry picked from commit 13ce823686062d70b268b4d3888849adef07e4ff)
  Additional fix: oslo.service provides this facility through it's wait()

                  method which gets called when graceful shutdown is

The Nova process can have a delay between identifying that a neutron
port is on a given host and when it creates the VIF.  The PVIDLooper was
created to handle that delay.

However it has an issue where if the delay was too long, it would time
out and error.  Also, the optimize code had an exposure where it did not
take into account pending VLAN IDs.

The delay from nova could be particularly high if there was BDM's in
use.

This change set resolves both of these issues.  It introduces a timeout
for the pvid update.  This becomes user configurable, but defaults to
the standard VIF timeout.  While these are not 100% the same, it is a
similar concept.

It also incorporates a check into the heal code to take into account
pending VLAN provisions.

The great majority of our time related properties on resources are named
""something_at"". That started because the body values in responses in a
number of resources are actually named that, and we seem to have
converged on that naming scheme over ""something"", as that could in some
cases appear as a boolean (updated? Is it true, is it the time, etc).
This change corrects a few that were un-suffixed or that had a different
suffix. We should now be consistent on time related properties.

Add image operation failed will lead to rollback operation,
delete this image if it was created.
If this operation throws some exception, previous one will be
overwritten so that we cannot elegantly trace the problem occurs.
We could log failed exception info before rollback operation.

This commits wraps executed functions so that no exception can be
