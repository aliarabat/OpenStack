This commit addresses multiple potential vulnerabilities in
Magnum. It makes the following changes:

* Permissions for /etc/sysconfig/heat-params inside Magnum
  created instances are tightened to 0600 (used to be 0755).
* Certificate retrieval is modified to work without the need
  for a Keystone trust.
* The cluster's Keystone trust id is only passed into
  instances for clusters where that is actually needed. This
  prevents the trustee user from consuming the trust in cases
  where it is not needed.
* The configuration setting trust/cluster_user_trust (False by
  default) is introduced. It needs to be explicitely enabled
  by the cloud operator to allow clusters that need the
  trust_id to be passed into instances to work. Without this
  setting, attempts to create such clusters will fail.

Please note, that none of these changes apply to existing
clusters. They will have to be deleted and rebuilt to benefit
from these changes.

(cherry picked from commit e93d82e8b3bc19211efd54edc17aebdca50670c1)

Changes for backport:

* Moved cluster_user_trust setting to magnum/common/keystone.py
* Resolved merge conflicts.
* Fixed unit tests with configuration overrides.

To prevent that, several global rate limters are added. So that the

The _allocate_for_instance() method of the scheduler report client was
designed to query the supplied Instance object and construct a payload
of allocation data to send to the placement service that only included
the VCPU, MEMORY_MB and DISK_GB resource classes.

In upcoming patches, we will be changing the way that Ironic baremetal
nodes have their inventory and allocations registered. Specifically, for
those instances that are assigned to an Ironic node, we will no longer
be ""consuming"" VCPU, MEMORY_MB and DISK_GB resources on an Ironic
baremetal node but rather, the instance will be consuming the node
itself in its entirety. The inventory of the baremetal node resource
provider will be a single record of an amount of 1 for the resource
class matching the Ironic node's ""resource_class"" attribute.

In preparation for this upcoming change, this patch splits the code in
the _allocate_for_instance() method that constructs the payload sent to
the placement service from the code that looks at the Instance object's
flavor representation's vcpus, memory_mb and local_gb amounts.

Voelker,mvoelker,"Rename DefCore Committee -> Interop Working Group

At the Board of Directors meeting on April 24, 2016 the Board of
Directors indicated that as DefCore has evolved it's focus on
interoperability and it's working structure, it's name may be a
source of some confusion to those outside of the community or who are new
to the community.  The Board made an informal request that the DefCore
Committee consider changing it's name to more clearly reflect it's
focus and structure.  In August of 2016, the Board passed a resolution
renaming the group to ""The Interop Working Group"".[1]

Since then, the Interop Working Group has completed a series of changes
to it's documentation and public resources to reflect it's new name.[2]
The next step in the process is to rename the project's resources in
infra, including it's git repository and associated artifacts.[3]  This
This commit modifies a few remaining governance artifacts that referece
DefCore to use the new name/artifacts instead.  Past TC resolutions
referencing DefCore have been ommitted to preserve historical context.

During upgrade testing, move Keystone containers behind an HAProxy
load balancer and run a benchmarking tool to make continuous requests
against the keystone API, providing summary output at the end of the
play. This should help ensure the upgrade process between releases
remains without downtime.

To avoid service interruptions because of files being replaced during
installations:
  - set the 'keystone_venv_tag' var so that it changes between releases
  - perform the 'Create WSGI symlinks' task only after the files being
    linked to exist

Benchmarking scripts were provided by:

We don't need to restart nginx - we can instead just reload the
service. Additionally, as more services move to use nginx frontend, it
would be bad to restart all NGinx services at the same time.

For now we need to investigate the impact of reloads in UWsgi before
moving over to a ""reload"" on UWsgi.

This patch adds static icmp responder for each router interface and
openflow rule for each router interface.

If the router interface is concrete, the packet will be sent to EGRESS_TABLE.
If the router interface is virtual, the packet will be sent to local
controller. And local controller will respond icmp unreachable message.

It's possible for iDRACs to get into a state where the Name element is
not returned when querying DCIM_ComputerSystem.  This results in the
get_power_state command failing against nodes with iDRACs in this
state.

This patch removes selecting on the Name element from get_power_state.
This makes get_power_state work against both nodes with iDRACs in this
state and iDRACs not in this state.

Renames the ""artifacting"" strategy to ""tagfilter"" and implements
a more generic tag skipping implementation that can be defined
from within the ansible vars structure dynamically on a per-host,
per-group, or per-playbook basis.

To use the tagfilter strategy, run the playbook with
strategy: tagfilter

and define a hostvar named ""skip_tags"". Skip tags can be a string
or a list, and any tag CONTAINING a skip tag (an exact match is not
needed) will be skipped.

Also added is a check for a var called ""skip_handlers"", defaulted
to True. When skip_handlers is enabled, no handlers will be run
regardless of whether the task is skipped or not. If set to False,

The neutron agent ovsdb api and native modules are used
by a number of consumers including networking-ovn. This
patch rehomes them to neutron-lib.

The following refactorings are noteworthy:
- The functions in helpers.py are only used in idlutils, so they
are move there.
- A few constants were moved out of the conf files and put
into neutron_lib.agent.constants as they make more sense
there.

Also note that while there's a current neutron patch related to
these opts in neutron [1] if we agree to this neutron-lib opts
approach the respective changes from [1] will change when
we consume this from neutron-lib.

TODOs before merging this patch:
- Determine if this rehome make sense.
- UTs.
- More manual testing.
- Docs (if there are any to rehome in neutron).
- Release note

This adds the basic framework for registering and using default policy
rules in code. Rules should be defined and returned from a module in
keystone/policies, and then added to the list in
keystone/policies/__init__.py.

This commit does the following:
    - Introduces framework for registering default policies in code
    - Moves default endpoint policies into code
    - Moves default service policies into code
    - Moves default region policies into code

Future patches will move the remaining rule groups from policy.json
into their respective files.

Currently the _create_image_volume() method in solidfire.py doesn't
catch the exception for initialize_connection() or connect_volume(),
therefore when something wrong happens at this stage, which is as
critial as image conversion, the empty volume created as image cache
wouldn't be deleted.  And that invalid image cache would cause all
consecutive volume creation from same image fail silently.

This change makes simple adjustment of the code to make sure the
errors happen at connecting volume to controler stage is being

The idea is to bring more feedback when testing patches in these
projects and detect what failures we could have outside devstack.

The jobs are not voting. We don't expect tacker team to open TripleO job
logs. The idea is to let TripleO folks know when a job is red so they
can investigate and tell if something critical is broken in the patch.

Commit e7361775c112e32ea517eddc344641897d273d25 changed the code to
use Python 3 style print function, but when doing 'print()' in Python
2.7 it would print '()':
    >>> print()
    ()

Import the __future__ print function so that a blank line will be
printed as expected. This will now work the same in Python 2 & 3.

ansible_user is currently used both as the builtin variable
and a regular variable. Since its value changes multiple times
over the course of a deployment, determining its value at any given
point in time can be difficult. In addition, overriding its value
in order to connect to the virthost with a different user has
unexpected results for the same reason.

ansible_user is therefore replaced  with ssh_user, which is never
modified from its default in common defaults, and can be safely
overridden by the user.

Based on the libvirt distro support matrix wiki [1] this change
bumps the minimum required version of libvirt to 1.2.9 and
QEMU to 2.1.0. These were both advertised as the next minimums
since Newton, we just never made the change in Ocata.

The next minimum libvirt version is set to 1.3.1 and the next
minimum QEMU version is set to 2.5.0, which is what we gate
on with Ubuntu 16.04 but also falls within the distro support
matrix for a representative set of other supported distros.

We currently use a more permisive STRICT_ALL_TABLES mode, but that's
not what modern MySQL versions default to (i.e. TRADITIONAL):

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#sql-mode-changes

(non-Devstack deployments will most likely use TRADITIONAL as well)

Due to the fact that we default to TRADITIONAL in oslo.db, this
produces annoying warnings on MySQL 5.7 versions we use in the gate:

    Warning: (3090, u""Changing sql mode 'NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER' is
              deprecated. It will be removed in a future release."")

https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/oslo.db/tree/oslo_db/options.py#n49

Unlike STRICT_ALL_TABLES, TRADITIONAL mode includes NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,
and MySQL emits this warning on switching it on:

https://dev.mysql.com/worklog/task/?id=8326

So we have two options here:

1) make oslo.db default to STRICT_ALL_TABLES
2) make Devstack default to TRADITIONAL

The latter seems to be more appropriate as:

1) it's what modern MySQL versions default to
2) it's what people are actually using, if they do not override the
   oslo.db default
3) it's more strict

The assumption that we don't need to write an entry in the invalidations
file when the hashes.pkl does not exist turned out to be a premature
optimization and also wrong.

Primarily we should recognize the creation of hashes.pkl is the first
thing that happens in a part when it lands on a new primary.  The code
should be optimized toward the assumption of the most common disk state.

Also, in this case the extra stat calls to check if the hashes.pkl exists
were not only un-optimized - but introducing a race.

Consider the common case:

proc 1                         | proc 2
-------------------------------|---------------------------
a) read then truncate journal  |
b) do work                     | c) append to journal
d) apply ""a"" to index          |

The index written at ""d"" may not (yet) reflect the entry writen by proc
2 at ""c""; however, it's clearly in the journal so it's easy to see we're
safe.

Adding in the extra stat call for the index existence check increases
the state which can effect correctness.

proc 1                        | proc 2
------------------------------|---------------------------
a) no index, truncate journal |
b) do work                    | b) iff index exists
                              | c) append to journal
d) apply (or create) index    |

If step ""c"" doesn't happen because the index does not yet exist - the
update is clearly lost.

In our case we'd skip marking a suffix as invalid when the hashes.pkl
does not exist because we know ""the next time we rehash"" we'll have to
os.listdir suffixes anyway.  But if another process is *currently*
rehashing (and has already done it's os.listdir) instead we've just
dropped an invalidation on the floor.

Don't do that.

Instead - write down the invalidation.  The running rehash is welcome to
proceed on outdated information - as long as the next pass will grab and
hash the new suffix.

Known-Issue(s):

If the suffix already exists there's an even chance the running rehash
will hash in the very update for which we want to invalidate the suffix,
but that's ok it's idempotent.

REPLICATE calls where everything is in sync and no suffixes have been
invalidated are supposed to be pretty common and fairly cheap.  If an
invalidations files is empty there's no need to perform a truncation
write operation which will presumably at some point have to flush.

Everyone owes Pavel a quarter for the one billion less write ops in prod

... and Matt a nickel for 20ms of not sleep back every unittest run

As a drive by I remove a crufty confusing OSError exception handler
around an open call that would be using O_CREAT in a directory that it
either just created or opened a file from - it wasn't going to raise
ENOENT.  Similarly rather than loose sleep trying to reason about all
the crazy exceptions that actually *could* pop anywhere in this method,
instead I improve the logging where any such exception would be caught.
This way we can get the details we need to focus on only errors that
actually happen.

As described in bug #1558754 a rebalance after removing a device fails
if min_part_seconds_left > 0, despite the note that a rebalance should
remove partitions from removed devices on the next run.

This patch skips the early exit, and lets the builder itself handling
the rebalance. Partitions that shouldn't move now are still not moved
(except for removed devices), and there is still a warning if no
partition has been moved due to the fact that min_part_hours did not yet
pass.

A small test has been added to ensure rebalancing after removing a
device works without using the --force option (tests fails on current
master). Another test ensures that a rebalance after a recent change
(for example increasing a device's weight) does not move partitions and
still reports the former warning message.

With a min_part_hours of zero, it's possible to move more than one
replicas of the same part in a single rebalance.

This change in behavior only effects min_part_hour zero rings, which
are understood to be uncommon in production mostly because of this
very specific and strange behavior of min_part_hour zero rings.

With this change, no matter how small your min_part_hours it will
always require at least N rebalances to move N part-replicas of the
same part.

To supplement the existing persisted _last_part_moves structure to
enforce min_part_hours, this change adds a _part_moved_bitmap that
exists only during the life of the rebalance, to track when rebalance
moves a part in order to prevent another replicas of the same part
from being moved in the same rebalance.

When I initially implemented consistency group support in the SolidFire driver
I did not reailze that a use case/path would involve creating a volume from a
snapshot that was part of a group snap/cgsnap.

Due to the way that SolidFire takes group snapshots, and the naming scheme
that is used for the resulting snapshots, some additional lookups are needed
in order to locate the correct snapshot. This was implemented correct for the
various cgsnap calls but it is missing from the create volume from clone path.
This patch corrects that and the fix was verified against a cluster running
SolidFire release Oxygen 8.0.1.3.

Commit bfbf0d1e78ff47937adb06bce648a0b915c838d1 removed a check that was
meant to avoid to resolve a storage domain. It breaks the behavior of the
middleware as the resolution of a storage domain will return nothing, so
the global resolution will fail.

Example:
  Host header: storage.example.com
  storage_domain: [.storage.example.com]

  Host does not end with one of the storage_domains (because of the dot),
  so the middleware will loop to resolve the CNAME of storage.example.com,
  but it won't succeed because it's a storage_domain.

The use of a literal snowman in a URL is an invalid URL. In Python 3
the url parsing code used by gabbi will not accept this URL and
correctly rejects it. Python 2 is less strict and passes it on
(presumably encoding it somewhere in the stack).

Python 3's behavior is correct and the fact that the test ever
worked was an artifact of Python 2's bad behavior. The test
immediately following the removed test is testing the correct and
legitimate HTTP behavior, so it is best to just remove the bad one.

By doing so all functional tests pass under python3 so the
test-functional-py3.txt has been made empty, with a comment. This
was done, instead of removing it, to signal the state of affairs.

The check and subsequent hard failure for HostMapping records in
API migration 30 is inconvenient at times during a new setup where
we have flavors in place but no hosts yet. Since we can now check
for and warn about missing HostMapping records in our upgrade
status command, this patch lowers the lack of host mappings check
from a failure to a warning. This migration was really just to make
sure you ran the simple setup command, and the cell mapping check
does that for us.

The generated source should be placed in a directory call 'install-guide'
inside existing repositories. Because of that the creation of the repository
directory itself is not possible.

Cookiecutter requires a directory call {{cookiecutter..}} as starting point.
Because of that the only solution without modifing cookiecutter itself is
to add a dummy directory_name variable.

This change also improves the README file. The use of this cookiecutter template
is documeted in the OpenStack Contributor Guide.

This is WIP until Oslo.Serialization 1.10 is added to global requirements.

It is an OpenStack goal to make the code base Python 2 and 3 compatible.
This commit makes several changes to enable that and extends the py34
unit test environment to enforce it.

The following conventions were used:
1) oslo.serialization.base64 has base64 encode and decode routines that
accept both bytes and strings as input, and can return bytes or strings
as output.  They are very Python 2/3 friendly.
2) b'foo'.  The b'' string prefix has no affect in Python 2.  It is a
signal to Python 3 that a string literal is a bytestring. b'' is the
right choice for much of Barbican, since that the type expected and
returned by many of our dependent libraries.
3) e.message for exceptions has been removed.  It is deprecated in py27
and removed from py3.
4) ''.encode('utf-8') generates bytes from a string for py3.  It returns
the string for py2.
5) b''.decode('utf-8') generates a string from from bytes for py3.  It
generates u'' for py2, which is not typically used in Barbican.
6) isinstance(obj, type) can be used to check for necessary conversions if
needed.
7) // does integer division

Ceph Jewel has introduced the ability to mirror its pools. If configured
to do so, the rbd-mirror daemon will replay an image's journals to
replicate the image at a remote Ceph store. In order for an image to be
mirrored, the 'exclusive-lock' and 'journaling' feature bits need to be
enabled per image.

Ceph documentation recommends using ""rbd features default = 125"" in the
Ceph configuration to enable these feature bits for all newly created
images. However, if an image has an explicit set of feature bits asked
for during its creation, that request overrides what is set for ""rbd
features default"". The Ceph backup driver is specifcally asking for
""stripingv2"" and ""layering""; thus ignoring what is set at ""rbd features
default"".

This patch adds a new configuration option, 'backup_ceph_image_journals'
which adds these feature bits to the 'features' set returned by
_get_rbd_support(). If 'backup_ceph_image_journals' is set to True and
the underlying installation of RBD does not support either JOURNALING or
EXCLUSIVE_LOCK, an error is logged and 'BackupCephInvalidArgs' is raised
whenever an operation attempts to create a new Cepd object.

We deprecated the image proxy commands and APIs in Newton
due to the 2.36 microversion. We said after Ocata 15.0.0 we
would remove these, which we can do now in Pike.

Note that the list() method on the ImageManager has to be
moved to the GlanceManager since we still need to list images
for the --image-with option on the boot command. The _match_image
method in the shell has to be updated for a glance v2 response
where custom metadata properties are flat in the image body.

This needs to be released with a major version bump.

After implementing blueprint ""Ability to run some Nova services under Apache2""(
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/run-nova-services-under-apache2)
it becomes possible not to use separate ports for each openstack service but
share 80 port with different URL prefixes.

Mailing list thread with discussion the details of this feature:
http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-June/067147.html.

Openstack wiki page with mapping urls to services:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/URLs.

If nova-api service is started by Apache (or similar),
using 'Alias' directive script name contains alias-prefix.
We get things like: '/ALIAS/NAME/v2', '/ALIAS/NAME/v2.1'
This change makes sure we compose correct url for getting list of versions.

The statsd.j2 include approach is great, but it is hitting an ansible

seem to be fixed anytime soon.

Here is an example bug:

In Ocata nova uses the transport_url for communication to rabbitmq.
In the charm the default port 5672 was assumed. However, when
rabbitmq uses SSL it changes the port to 5671.

This pulls in the fix which makes the default port explicit and
changes the port when SSL is in use.
