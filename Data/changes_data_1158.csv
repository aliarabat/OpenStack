We put some warning statements in a while back for
lvs and vgs commands that lasted more than 60 seconds
so we could easily query issues in the gate.

Since then we've made a number of changes to improve our
LVM interactions including the use of an LVM conf file with
a filter for only the VG's Cinder uses.

There's one issue remaining however where during the instance
rescue test in Nova where LVM get's stuck trying to open
devices that no longer exist.  Part of this I think is due
to some manipulation that Nova/KVM does on the attached volume
when the test is run, but also the rescue process in Nova
uses LVM volumes as well and does some moving around and mounting
of devices.

The result is that LVM calls can take quite a while
(greater than 100 seconds) to complete during the rescue process.
This doesn't result in any failures, just that the rescue process
slows things down dramatically and is a pretty heavy process.

Also, the newer versions of process utils include completion
timing in the logs so we don't really need this any longer eve
to query timings and get info.

This patch removes those log statements, and proposes we
document somewhere that rescue operations on a setup that
includes c-vol service and nova-compute service on the same
node will temporarily impact LVM performance.

we need to bump the memory size from 512MB to 1GB to be able to test it
in gate. It's important to note that since the concurrency job needs 3 VMs
we will still run it using the old ramdisk until we can solve the problem.

Plus, for normal jobs where we bumped the RAM size we are lowering the
number of VMs created from 3 to 1, because only 1 VM get's used anyway.

This patch is making use of the new DEVSTACK_LOCAL_CONFIG that allows
passing arbitrary config options to devstack-gate.

Current code might delete local handoff objects incorrectly
when remote node requires whole of the objects at poking
because empty cand_objs won't be applied to the delete candidate

This patch ensures the delete candidate objects list always
will be updated (i.e. it will be empty list when the poke job
find whole local objects are required by remote), and then,
handle deleting objects correctly according to the delete
candidate.

Previously a user could place any value the host header of their
http request to Barbican and the result returned would have
the correct URL in the body, but the response location header was
built using the provided (and possibly malicious) host value from
the request header.

Resolved this by ensuring that the location header in the response
field matches the URL returned in the body.

This patch will not allow the 3PAR iSCSI driver to pick another
iSCSI IP from the hp3par_iscsi_ips list during a nova live-migration.

Nova expects that the IQN will be exactly the same as it's attaching
the volume(s) to the new host during live-migration. This conflicts
with the Cinder settings such as ""hp3par_iscsi_ips"" which allows for
multiple IPs for the purpose of load balancing.

Currently, for cold migration, there is a presumption of success unlike
live migration. The instance's host and node fields are updated to the
destination host after the disk and network are migrated to the
destination, but before the images are fetched from glance and applied
(in finish_migration). This makes it impossible to do a fallback to
copy from the source host if the needed image isn't found in glance,
as the source host has already been blown away on the instance, when
migration isn't actually finished yet.

This change moves the assignment of instance host and node to the
finish_migration step, after images have been fetched and applied,
when migration is actually finished.

We have a lot of new angular widgets and panels coming, and some of them
will need access to configs stored in settings. Right now, the default way to
get them is through _conf.html or _script.html. We should really fetch them
through the new REST layer instead. This ensures we are following the same
pattern already set up for angular panels and services.

This version:
- add localstorage for caching config front-end

Once you run './redstack kick-start <datastore>' the image is cached.
If you then pull a more recent copy of the trove-integration repo and
run kick-start again, it will use the cached image.  It will do this
even if the corresponding elements have changed.

This fix checks all the files in the elements directory and prints
out a message if the cached image directory is older than any of
the files that it is built with.  An option to force a rebuild of
the image was also added.

This handles the happy and slightly-less-happy paths for EC GET and
HEAD.

In the happy path, enough fragment archives are found to reconstitute
the object. Also, 404s in EC containers work.

Theoretically, EC GET will resume downloads like replicated GET if an
object server fails halfway through. That's not really tested yet,
though. There are tests for some of the lower-level functionality, but
there isn't one that kills an object server partway through.

The approach is basically Clay's approach with the two object
controllers. The proxy server picks the right one based on the
container's storage policy. The vast majority of the old
ObjectController is the same, but the class name changed to
BaseObjectController, and then there's a couple derived classes to
hold EC-specific and replication-specific behavior.

During code development a number of items were re-evaluated so the following
changes were made:

* Instead of a tempauth admin_groups configuration option, we use a
  require_group option. Two reasons:
  1) The .admin group concept is pretty much baked into the existing
     code and tests. A change would be extensive and hard to review.
  2) require_group is closer in concept to keystoneauth's service_roles
     configuration option.

* Originally reseller_admin_role and allow_overrides were proposed to
  allow a prefix. On reflection, it was concluded that it does not make
  sense for these to only apply to specific prefixes.

* Removed the concept of internalURL (in Service Catalog) becaused
  this is not easily configurable in Keystone.

Also corrected or clarified examples by fixing or changing group
names, role names and paths in various places.

This is a functional test that boots a server via the cli, creates a
volume, and tries to attach it via the cli (which causes a failure due
to completion cache code). Note: the failure actually happens *after*
the attach command is dispatched, so the volume attach will still
work, the user is presented an error though.

Many TODOs remain for future patches. The test also tries to document
what was learned about the CLI redirection to cinder API, which was
introduced when Cinder was split out, but was tribal knowledge that
was lost in the mists of time.

allocate_fixed_ip, which is a much cleaner unit boundary with its own

Devstack is currently supporting plugins. As some authors write
plugins they try various ways of solving their issue. One author
tried to set the value of ERROR_ON_CLONE to FALSE to get their
plugin to work. OpenStack gate needs this variable to remain
with the value of TRUE.

Trying to create a devstack plugin by setting this variable to
FALSE is the wrong approach.

Any resources which work with headers - mostly Container and Object in
object_store - are not currently working properly due to the case
sensitive nature of the attributes being in a traditional dictionary.
Any header props *set* on those resources which are then sent to the
server are ok, which is why we've been able to set and then receive our
own values,  but any that are received would have to be in the matching
case that the prop is setup as. This is not generally the case, as
setting metadata on containers or objects in Horizon or other control
panels uses capitalization, which ends up not matching up properly when
we convert the server values into a resource.

This change implements a CaseInsensitiveDict which keeps the original
user-set values around and then keeps a dictionary mapping a lowercased
version of the key to the user-set key. It implements the typical
MutableMapping operations.

Currently we have a somewhat bogus internal equivalence between the
""json"" parameter type and the MAP property type.  This is a problem
when exposing json parameters via provider resources, because the
schema of the exposed property does not exactly match the capabilities
of the underlying parameter.

Specifically, json parameters can take strings (json serialized list or
map), and also lists and maps directly.  Currently, we can only pass
maps, which means some data, for example a list of maps (which is possible
when interacting directly with a json parameter) is not possible when
using the same parameter abstracted via a TemplateResource.

To work around this add a flag which relaxes the type rules and enables
some coercion of map values, only when they're going via a schema derived
from a json parameter.

This change set provides some refactorings that make the code easier to
read and maintain.  The key changes are:
 - Support fixtures in a similar way that nova_powervm does.  This
   reduces the amount of mock up code required for testing.
 - Rename the powervm_sea_agent to sea_agent.  The PowerVM is already
   part of the namespace (due to the folder it is in).  This was
   creating too long of a name for use.
 - Change the connection utility to be PVMUtils.  Simpler name more in
   line with how the function has evolved.
 - Incorporated some code comments from an earlier change set that was
   early merged.

Having DATABASE_QUERY_LOGGING enabled results in devstack turning
on verbose mysql query logging. This results in a log file
/var/log/mariadb/mariadb-slow.log that grows to 10's of GB in
size in very little time (few weeks if that). Developers never
seem to notice this exists until their host OS runs out of disk
space due to this logfile that is never truncated.

Very few people will ever look at this logged data, so a more
sensible default is False, to make the out of the box setup be
suitable for the majority. Those few people who want to debug
mysql query performance can enable it in local.conf, as will
the devstack gate setup scripts.

Instead of doing inline setup of the API service in integrated_helpers
extract this functionality to a fixture so that it can easily be
reused in other functional tests.

The setup work to patch the global CONF to be able to run the API
server is also extracted into a fixture, and the inline setup in
integrated_helpers is removed.

fake_network=True is already set in the global conf_fixture used by
nova.test, setting it again here is redundant (also, aren't deep
inheritance stacks in tests fun‽)

The _get_flags support is still required because ~ 13 tests manipulate
the extension lists with it (though they make no other changes). We
should semantically extract that concept so that a test can declare an
extension list more abstractly, and we get that to the OSAPI fixture.

If the image is deleted by appropriate API call while its content
is still being uploaded in import task in v2, an exception is raised
and it is not handled in the API code. This leads to the fact that
the uploaded image file stays in a storage and clogs it.

There existed code that safely removes image files if the exception
occurs.

ML2 agents tend to support a rebuild of the bridges upon a restart of
the agent.  This change set provides a baseline for the agent such that
it rebuilds properly upon boot up.  The clean up should:
 - Ensure that each Neutron Port is served via the Network Bridge
 - Remove any non-required VLANs off the bridges
 - Only removes VLANs that aren't in use, whether it is managed by
   Neutron or externally.

The clean method also runs periodically during query.  It does this as
it is a moderately expensive method call.  Future change sets will
optimize this flow.

This is a test requirement for Nova change
Ic4dee3126dda2a25455235fea6a6574b64cd51a3 .

toposort implements a topological sort in Python. The above change
uses it to ensure correct ordering wrt referential integrity
constraints when reconstructing a MySQL schema from a cache during
unit tests.

The library is fairly simple. I would expect it to be updated rarely.

It is python 3 compatible.

It uses the Apache 2.0 licence.

It is not packaged for either Ubuntu or Fedora as of February 2015.

Its function is not covered by any other currently required library
that I'm aware of.

A feasible, but undesirable, alternative to using this package would
be to implement a topological sort function in OpenStack.

Additionally the idea of making extra API queries for a bash completion

For some of the apis like add_route, delete_route, add_gateway., etc

this information based on the arguments like CIDR/ip_address etc.
However, for apis like get_gateway, list_onlink_routes and delete_gateway

these api's only return IPv4 routes. This patch includes the necessary

Because of the new gating system (gate-training-guides-tox-slides), we need to
cleanup all existing RST files.

There is a small rendering problem with Landslide in the Upstream training
and all the Title slides (empty slides with only a Title). The check doesn't
like ""empty"" slides (""Document or section may not begin with a transition.""),
Landslide deals with this by ignoring errors
(https://github.com/adamzap/landslide/issues/94), but our gating check does
not. I temporary changed all such slides to normal ones.

I also had to change training-guides/landslide.sh a bit (a quick hack so that
it works as expected).

command of the child process to start executing before it can return to

This reverts commit 4c8cefb98a425382204df2f38f24e6b5b71520dd.

The cache completion was causing a bug where 'nova volume-attach' would
then try to query Nova for volume information using a URL that was not
valid.  This caused it to appear that the attach had failed.

Additionally the idea of making extra API queries for a bash completion
cache should be thought through more.

'allow_duplicate_networks' flag should allow an instance to have
multiple vNICs attached to the same Neutron network.

After setting this flag to true, booting instance with multiple
interfaces to attach to same network(with same net-id) like below
is failing.

We have check for duplicate networks at nova api layer(i.e nova/api/
openstack/compute/servers.py). We can just skip this check when we are
using neutron. Because we already have same check in network api(i.e
nova/network/neutronv2/api.py) and also as 'allow_duplicate_networks'
flag is only for nova neutron.

In Ironic we want to be able to use the IPA ramdisk as the default ramdisk
for our deployments, since that ramdisk is a heavier than our previous one
we need to bump the memory size from 512MB to 1GB to be able to test it
in gate. It's important to note that since the cuncurrency job needs 3 VMs
we will still run it using the old ramdisk until we can solve the problem.

Plus, for normal jobs where we bumped the RAM size we are lowering the
number of VMs created from 3 to 1, because only 1 VM get's used anyway.

Currently Neutron does not validate the version of Keepalived.
In order to support configuring IPv6 default route, the minimum
version [1] of keepalived that is required is 1.2.10
This patch adds a sanity check to validate the keepalived version.

Although keepalived changelog mentions that IPv6 virtual_routes and
static_routes are supported in version 1.2.8, it is seen that in
v1.2.8 IPv6 default route is not supported. Support for default route
is added in keepalived v1.2.10. Observations on v1.2.8 are captured
at the following link - http://paste.openstack.org/show/165403/

Some things (namely stevedore) already depend on setuptools
but they rely on the fact that setuptools is often implicitly
available by it's nature of being a commonly installed tool.
However setuptools is not a mandatory library, and pip in
particular can install from Wheels without setuptools being
present. To rectify this setuptools needs added to the
requirements of any project that depends on it at runtime.

This is a proposed fix for:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1419785

The above happens when you configure 2 HA nodes with different
hostnames to manage the same cluster. On failover, badness ensues when
the incorrectly hostnamed standby tries to take over.

It would be nice to fix the badness, however it is currently very
deeply engrained in Nova. Lots of things assume a consistent 'host',
and they will all be broken in this scenario. Instead, this patch
detects a change of Nova compute, and rejects it.

During the driver's init_host it checks all managed clusters for the
custom value 'openstack_compute_host'. If the value is not present, it
sets it to the current host. If it is, it checks it against the
current hostname. It will raise an Exception if any non-matching

One of possibilities of AWS LoadBalancer usage is to pass it the list of
instance id's to manage already in the template during create.
This patch actually enables this scenario by (re)starting the haproxy
service to catch the created config with initial servers in it.

Note that the other usage scenario (passing the LB id to the *Group
resource) was not affected as in this case there is implicit update of
AWS LB resource that restarts the haproxy service.

Appropriate functional/scenario test is coming in a subsequent patch.

This patch introduces changes that necesarry to join all stages
into one graph.

<stage>_start is root for stage entity
<stage>_end is end task in stage entity

That is done to ensure that each stage is self contained,
and for example in case of adding more stages there will be no need to
look for end tasks and connect them

The only two harcdoded parameters are deploy_start and deploy_end,
stuff that we are including in pre_deployment is everything that comes before
deploy_start, and for post_deployment after deploy_end

If given the chunk size, chunks are yielded to the client in exactly
that size (except the last chunk). Data read from the object server
will be buffered until there's a full chunk.

This is good for EC because we can set this to the size of a fragment,
then instantiate a bunch of these things and read one chunk from each,
then decode and send it on up the line.

It even works with the download-resumption logic; any
buffered-but-not-yielded bytes are thrown away, so we don't have to
worry about Frankenfragments getting into the decoder.

The current live migration code simply invokes migrateToURI
and waits for it to finish, or raise an exception. It considers
all exceptions to mean the live migration aborted and the VM is
still running on the source host. This is totally bogus, as there
are a number of reasons why an error could be raised from the
migrateToURI call. There are at least 5 different scenarios for
what the VM might be doing on source + dest host upon error.
The migration might even still be going on, even if after the
error has occurred.

A more reliable way to deal with this is to actively query
libvirt for the domain job status. This gives an indication
of whether the job is completed, failed or cancelled. Even
with that though, there is a need for a few heuristics to
distinguish some of the possible error scenarios.

This change to do active monitoring of the live migration process
also opens the door for being able to tune live migration on the
fly to adjust max downtime or bandwidth to improve chances of
getting convergence, or to automatically abort it after too much
time has elapsed instead of letting it carry on until the end of
the universe. This change merely records memory transfer progress
and leaves tuning improvements to a later date.

This change logs the warning at lookup time instead of parse time
because we have no way of knowing at parse time which options are
deprecated.  It does use a set to make sure it only logs a given
deprecation warning once per option so it won't spam the logs.

I could not find a way to log deprecations for cli args.  argparse
seems to only write the value to the undeprecated name, so there's
no way to tell whether it came from a deprecated name originally.
Since most of our opts are set through config files I don't see
this as a huge issue though.

I'm also not using the warnings module because its deprecation
mechanisms seem more developer focused, and for config opts we
need to notify the user.  This is not possible with the warnings
module in Python 2.6 (there's no way to send warnings to the log
by default), and since we still need to support that for oslo libs
I went with a simple logged warning instead.

This patch fix the issue by changing the call to
find the plugin which handles the l3 which is now
the l3_router service plugin instead of the old mixin.

Also change the unit tests to use the l3 service plugin
instead of the l3 mixin and refactor the rpc callbacks
part.

an exception when the pod is not found, but catches it in the

In test_subnet_details, Tempest checks the effect of alternative dns

However, sometimes the check failed because the update could not make
it before the check. This reason is not concrete yet, but this problem
happens three times in 60 minutes now.

Remote execute calls in the ganesha helpers are made using ganesha
utils's SSHExecutor object that uses  processutils's ssh_execute()
method. But processutils's ssh_execute() method unlike processutils's
execute() method does not accept an argument whose identifier is
'run_as_root=', necessary to execute commands with super user
privilege. So allow 'run as root' behavior in remote execution by
prepending 'sudo' to the command passed to processutils's ssh_execute()
method, in the SSHExecutor's __call__() method.

Like Cinder, Manila has a scheduler that operates (among other things)
on extra spec values in share types to determine which backend should
receive a new share.  In Kilo, Manila will adopt the pools feature from
Cinder, such that the scheduler may choose from more than one storage
destination per backend.  This commit adds a couple of per-pool
attributes to the share stats reported by the cDOT driver to the scheduler,
including aggregate disk type and RAID type.

  - tosca.relations.network.LinksTo
  - tosca.relations.network.BindsTo

2. Add support for implicit declaration of requirements by type.

For example:

tosca.nodes.network.Network:
  derived_from: tosca.nodes.Root
........
  requirements:
    - binding:
         type: tosca.capabilities.network.Bindable
    - link:
         type: tosca.capabilities.network.Linkable
........
