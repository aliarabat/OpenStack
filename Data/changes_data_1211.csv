These support classes started as a forklift of the classes needed
to run tempest scenario orchestration tests.

The original tempest code has been pared back to provide the
small subset required by heat integration tests. From this point on
these support classes can evolve to the specific needs of the
integration tests.

There is some unused code (especially in remote_client) which has
been left in as it may become useful in the future, and is already
extremely well reviewed and tested from being developed for tempest.

The script heat_integrationtests/generate_sample.sh will generate
an up-to-date heat_integrationtests/heat_integrationtests.conf.sample
file which can be copied to
heat_integrationtests/heat_integrationtests.conf
to override default configuration values. A local ConfigOpts is created
for each test to avoid any potential interaction with heat's
global CONF. Configuration options for credentials default to
being sourced from the environment.

The default tox testenv now excludes tests in heat_integrationtests.
A new testenv called ""integration"" will only run tests in
heat_integrationtests.

Integration tests will fail if preconditions are not met, including
a keystone endpoint, credentials and glance containing the expected
named image.

Devstack gate hooks have been moved to heat_integrationtests now that
the name of the package has been decided.

more, because they'd be only testing with released versions of
pbr. It's not clear why largeops, swift-functional, or cells were ever
added in the first place.

The previous event simulator simulated time by making all tasks that
would have been launched as threads run in the same thread. That only
worked to a point but didn't properly simulate more complex behaviors
such as clustering.

This new one handles things properly by still running tasks in
eventlet's greenthreads but forcing them to only run one at a time.

The l3 agent accepts an oslo configuration in its constructor and uses
it throughout the code, but there are some references to the global
configuration object held by the oslo library. Since HA functional
tests need to create two agents, the configuration should be consistent
throughout the code.

The important difference between the agents is their 'host' value so
that they create different namespaces, and 'state_path' value so the
agents get their own filesystem root.

Currently, the fork_child() function in auditor.py does not
handle the case where run_audit() encounters an exception
properly.

A simple case is where the /srv directory is set
with permissions such that the 'swift' user cannot access it.
Such a situation causes a os.listdir() to return an OSError
exception.  When this happens the fork_child() process does not
run to completion and sys.exit() is not executed.  The process
that was forked off continues to run as a result.  Execution goes
back up to the audit_loop function which restarts the whole process.  The
end result is an increasing number of processes on the system
until the parent is terminated.  This can quickly exhaust the
process descriptors on a system.

This change wraps run_audit() in a try block and adds an
exception handler that prints what exception was encountered.
The sys.exit() was moved to a finally: block so that it will
always be run, avoiding the creation of zombies.

The lock_timeout option that has been copied from memcached actually
does not mean the same thing at all. In memcached, it's used to expire
the lock when a client dies, whereas in IPC and ZK it's meant to be a
timeout on acquire().
This means that by default acquire(blocking=True) will have different
behaviours between the different drivers.

We now avoid that by removing lock_timeout from ZK and IPC, and allowing
the blocking argument from acquire() to be a numeric value.

Byte code strings passed into mask_password cause the coersion to
six.text_type to fail with a UnicodeDecodeError.  The code can
work with the byte code string, but the incoming message may be
an i18n object that has to be coerced.

The temporary fix is to ignore the UnicodeDecodeError on the
coersion.   A better solution will be provided for Kilo.

When discussing with the infra guys they have mentioned it would be
easier to call our linting job pep8, it's indeed badly named but that
target has been used all over openstack for linting projects. As a bonus
point it would make things easier to add the job to the gate. To make
that patch much more interesting than a three characters change I have
improved the validate-samples script to detect if jsonlint was present
and if not fallback to the standard python -mjson.tool which give you
less details but nonetheless works if jsonlint is present.

I updated basic environment content in the installation guide

1) Restructured and clarified OpenStack package procedures.
2) Removed RHEL/CentOS 6.5 special cases and workarounds.
3) Changed RHEL/CentOS to use systemd.
4) Improved SLES/openSUSE sysv/systemd steps.
5) Clarified firewall/security content.
6) Indicated that rebooting is necessary to activate network
   changes on Ubuntu and Debian.
7) Removed Python MySQL library from non-controller nodes

   interact with the database. I'm looking at you,

If none of this are met, the driver will raise a RuntimeException and

what we do is that we destroy it when releasing, and make the rest of

Stopping things is the job of stop-base.

upgrade-horizon is somewhat special in this case because stop-base
does nothing with it, so just to be sure it continues to stop but
uses screen_stop instead.

In the process remove direct references to calling 'screen' which
allows USE_SCREEN=False to work without 'screen' being unable to
find screens.

Add the Vagrant insecure public key to the base disk.

For installs over ssh, the public key is already installed by preseed
(or kickstart). For installs over a VirtualBox shared directory, the key
is currently only cached (in lib/vagrant-ssh-keys); a cluster build
without a key in the cache requires an Internet connection -- something
we want to avoid.

Leaving the script in config/scripts.* for the node VMs keeps base disks
built without this change working.

If more than one NFS share is defined, all volumes are allocated on the
same NFS share until it is not eligible anymore. Then a second NFS share
is filled. The code is supposed to split volumes between the different
NFS shares, not fill them one by one.

It is a bug in _find_shares(). If at least one NFS share is eligible,
the ""size"" parameter (size of the requested volume in gigabytes) is
replaced with the total size in bytes of the share. Because of that,
_find_shares() cannot find more one eligible NFS share.

_find_shares() sorts eligible volumes by available size. Because of this
bug, all volumes are allocated in the same NFS share, instead of being
splitted on different NFS shares.

The 'cinder manage' command argumenst are kind of a disaster.
The positionals are <host> <id> where <id> is undefined/free form
K/V pairs.  On top of it we then have --source-name and --source-id
optional arguments available.  There absolutely no way to tell from
the help what one should be entering here without referring to the
code, and even then it's not quite clear how the options work and
which one will be used.

To clean this up, change the positionals to <host> <identifier>
where both are strings.  Remove --source-name and --source-id
and consolidate those options with --id-type.

id-type will allow a user to specify the type of identifier
(source-name, source-id, or whatever), but defaults to
source-name which is most commonly used currently.

* NOTE *
Ideally we'd just do away with the designator source-name/source-id
altogether and just have an <identifier> positional arg.  Each driver
would then be responsible for figuring out what was passed an how to
deal with it.  This however requires changes in all of the drivers and
broader changes on the Cinder side which I don't think are warranted
during RC.

During Kilo we should clean all of this up, but for now at least the
syntax is somewhat ready for human consumption and a bit easier than
what we introduced.

Both MySQL and PostgreSQL can efficiently optimize queries using
indexes that use the prefix columns of the index. This means that
an index that covers columns (a, b, c) can be used to optimize
a query with the statement 'WHERE a = 1 and b = 9'.

Nova has indexes which are a prefix subset of other indexes. The
database servers can use the suffix superset indexes and the prefix
subset indexes just add extra overhead to inserts and updates.

Nejc Saje reported on the openstack-dev list that our hash ring was not
stable as hosts were added or removed. This is a significant issue since
the hash ring is meant to minimize the impact of adding or removing
conductors to only approximately the change in capacity.

IMPORTANT: When this patch is added to a running Ironic environment it
will cause ring calculations to change. This will cause most existing
node -> conductor mappings to be invalid, which will cause existing
deployed nodes to be unable to reboot (if using a netbooting driver like
pxe_ipmi). The cluster will self-correct over time as the periodic task
_sync_hash_ring() rebuilds PXE environments.

NOTE: The meaning of the hash_partition_exponent configuration setting
had to be changed - if we define the total number of partitions of the
ring via it then adding a host simultaneously removes some partitions of
each existing host as well as adding new partitions from the new host -
this results in more perturbation. Instead we use it to define the
number of partitions per host. Existing deployments will continue to
work, but may be able to reduce some CPU overhead by shrinking their
setting.

When adding a new tier (region, zone, node, device) to an existing,
already balanced ring all existing partitions in the existing tiers of
the same level are gathered for reassigning, even when there is
not enough space in the new tier. This will create a lot of unnecessary
replication traffic in the backend network.

For example, when only one region exists in the ring and a new region is
added, all existing parts are selected to reassign, even when the new
region has a total weight of 0. Same for zones, nodes and devices.

This patch limits the number of partitions that are choosen to reassign
by checking for devices on other tiers that are asking for more
partitions.

Failed devices are not considered when applying the limit.

This patch provides a new path for installing libraries in devstack so
that it's possible to either test with upstream released libraries, or
with git versions of individual libraries.

Libraries are added by name to 3 associative arrays GITREPO,
GITBRANCH, GITDIR. When we get to the library install phase we inspect
LIBS_FROM_GIT and look for libraries by name (i.e. ""oslo.config"") and
if they exist we'll clone and install those libraries from
git. Otherwise we won't, and just let pip pull them as dependencies
when it needs them.

This patch provides the conversion of the oslo libraries, including
pbr.

Devstack-gate jobs for these libraries will need to change to support
actually forward testing their content.

The test_v3_token_id test was calculating the token hash by
parsing the response JSON and generating a new JSON document.
This isn't guaranteed to work because a Python dict can have its
fields in any order[1], so the new JSON document may not match the
response JSON and you'd get a different hash. The correct way to
generate a token hash is to use the response as is.

Vol create with volume-type option is not working since
volume_backend_name contains the class name as
predefined string. No matter what was specified in cinder.conf
as volume_backend_name, volume creation failed.
Multi-backend option and using extra specs to create custom volumes
won't work.
The fix is to look whether volume_backend_name is part of the
configuration or falls into the class name in case there is
no backend name.

It has been observed that at a given iteration only one of the two HTTP
services responds to requests made to the VIP. This is somewhat rare and
it may be caused by the fact that the number of requests being sent is
not high enough for the ROUNDROBIN algorithm to equally distribute requests
across all the members in the pool.

Increasing the number of retries makes the test runtime only slightly
longer, but it should give us more confidence that, if we keep observing
the same type of failure, this can be ruled out.

At the same time, this patch also relaxes the check so that it just verifies
that member pools are load balanced at least once. Verifying that the number
of requests are spread evenly across is always going to be prone to transient
condition and it is beyond the scope of a scenario test that validates whether
Neutron LBaaS is wiring things correctly.

I noticed this when debugging [1]

devstack is intended to set $DATA_DIR to $DEST/data by default, but
currently it does that *before* reading localrc so it always uses its
default $DEST value of /opt/stack.

The code in devstack-gate.sh directly chowns /opt/stack/data/tempest
for the tempest user; this is required for tempest to be able to write
out lock-files.  This currently works due to the above, but if
devstack is fixed to correctly locate DATA_DIR under DEST, the chowned
path is now wrong.

The issue is made more confusing as the extant code explicitly sets
DATA_DIR if running grenade (why is not really explained in the
original change [2]).

The solution is to always explicitly set DATA_DIR to $BASE/data.
Since this is /opt/stack/data, the existing devstack (which
essentially assumes this path) continues to work.  A fixed devstack
will use the explicitly set path and continue to work.

There is no need to explicitly set SWIFT_DATA_DIR as that appears to
be a work-around for an old bug [3]

SQLAlchemy session/transaction lifecycles should be synchronized to
request lifecycles, initiating with session binding to the database
engine, followed by data model processing, followed by either a
commit() or rollback(), and finally a session disposal once the request

these lifecycle operations. For the API process, this means utilizing

above. For the Worker process, this means decorating each RPC method

There were tests that verified that the PKI token body could be
encrypted with CMS and compared to the token ID in the response.
This test isn't safe because the token body may be different than
the token encrypted with CMS since the order of items in the dict
can change.

The fix is to change the test to decode the PKI token ID and
compare that to the response body JSON instead.

these jobs are way more than what we need to test the library and they
may be wasting some resources in the gate. The patch proposes to run
just tempest and full jobs, which removes large-ops, heat and neutron

file_size_in_gb was rounding down. This is counter intuitive, as a
512MB disk is reported as 0GB. However, this rounding weirdness was
required for correctness in a way which wasn't obvious. When we test
if an image needs to be resized, we test instance.root_gb >
image.file_size_in_gb. Because file_size_in_gb was rounded down, an
image slightly smaller than 1GB will be reported as 0GB and therefore
resized.

The source of the rounding confusion is the bytes->gb conversion. To
make the code more obviously correct, I have switched it to instead
convert gb->bytes, which does not involve rounding. To ensure this
never trips anybody up, I have removed file_size_in_gb.

scenario.orchestration.test_server_cfn_init fails if Neutron is not
available. Neutron is not currently configured by default DevStack,
so running default set of tests after using DevStack would fail.

This patch would skip the test by using explicit no-Neutron skip.
It also adds 'network' service dependency to the list of service tags.
Note that the 'network' service tag never skips a test, as it is
assumed that nova-network is always available. This is why we need
and explicit skip.

Another solution that was considered is adding a new 'neutron'
service tag that would be used until nova-network deprecation is
complete. The argument against it is that having both 'network' and
'neutron' tags would cause confusion.

Pools can't be grouped together based on type, region or anything. This
is bad for a couple of things but probably the most critical effect is
that when adding pools of different types, the algorithm will balance
across all existing pools regardless of their type.

This patch adds a group field to pools. The group field's default value
is None so that it is backwards compatible for v1 and to avoid forcing
operators to set a group when they simply don't care.

In addition to the above, this patch makes flavors use the pool group
instead of the pool name. This allow us to have multiple pools baking a
specific flavor. Moreover, this also allows us to balance a flavor
across of registered pools and it's the base of the future queue
migrations work.

run_process will use screen if USE_SCREEN=True (the default),

Where stop_screen was found it has been replaced with stop_process.

A tail_log function has been added which will tail a logfile in a

When using sg the quoting in run_process gets very complicated.
To get around this run_process and the functions it calls accepts
an optional third argument. If set it is a group to be used with sg.

This introduces new run_process() and screen_service() functions and sets the
groundwork to change how DevStack starts services.  screen_service() is simply a
direct call to the screen portion of the old screen_it() function and is intended
to run commands that only need to run under screen, such as log file watchers.

run_process() is a replacement for screen_it() (which remains until all of the
services are updated).  The usage is similar but requires updates to every current
screen_it() call to remove everything that requires the command to be interpreted
by a shell.

The old run_process() and _run_process() functions are still present as
old_run_process() and _old_run_process() to support the deprecated screen_it()
function.  These will all go away in the future once all services have been
confirmed to have been changed over.

There is a similar new set of stop process functions stop_process() and
screen_stop_service().  The old screen_stop() will also remain for the deprecation
period.

As an initial test/demostration this review also includes the changes for
lib/cinder to demonstrate what is required for every service.

I included the scripts I used to test this; tests/fake-service.sh and
tests/run-process.sh are quite rough around the edges and may bite.  They should
mature into productive members of the testing ecosystem someday.

RouterInfo is a class that contains variables which help keep the state
of each router added to the l3 agent. Currently the constructor of
RouterInfo also initializes a new IptablesManager instance, which is
not needed for every RouterInfo instance (thus adding a rather large
overhead). This patch adds a new function to specifically initialize
the ri.iptables_manager variable after the creation of a new RouterInfo.

This change is required for dependent patches, which need to access the
ri.ns_name attribute, but don't need the iptables_manager.

x86_64 is the canonicalized arch for amd64 in Nova[1]. I think it makes
sense to make our scripts (and thus our UI) a bit friendlier by making
it as an accepted arch value. This will allow for the baremetal flavor
to be created with x86_64 set as cpu_arch in the extra_specs so that if
folks happened to register nodes with x86_64 instead of amd64 in Ironic,
the flavor matching will work.

Subunit is not a text protocol - it tunnels itself in stdout, but
that is not the same thing. The .txt extension leads to bad headers
from Apache:

wget -S http://logs.openstack.org/.../logs/subunit_log.txt.gz
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu)
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/plain

which are clearly bogus - and worse cause wget and curl to treat this
as a plain text file - so they apply line ending transformations to it
which breaks the contents. Some browsers are smarter when one does
'save link' - but all in all its a poor thing to present a binary
object as text.

Don't be confused by the lack of Content-Encoding on the object - thats a
separate issue.

This changeset removes the linuxbridge plugin, but retains the agent for ML2.
The database models were not removed since operators will need to migrate the
data.

Additionally, the ml2 migration script was altered to support Juno.  For
testing, a user must either run the migration against the icehouse
scheme or run the update, manually change alembic_version to juno and
then run the migration script.  Once the juno migration is added, this
manually step will not be required.

This is a similar issue as seen in 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1375382

The list of devices returned by driver.get_all_block_devices() in
_disconnect_volume_multipath_iscsi will potentially contain broken 
symlinks as the SCSI devices have been deleted from calling
self._linuxscsi.remove_multipath_device(device_realpath) right before
_disconnect_volume_multipath_iscsi but the udev rule for the symlink 
may not yet have completed.

Adding in a check to os.path.exists() will ensure that we will not 
consider the broken symlinks as an “in use” device.

This reverts commit ed586a0355fb99a5b1fbeadfc0625f0ceffe8b72.

The quota_class subcommand in python-novaclient was used to set default
quota values so it shouldn't have been removed. As now it is being
restored, the defaults quota panel is being restored too.

For functional testing of heat-standalone it is desirable for
heat to orchestrate on the rest of the cloud which is brought up
by devstack. This change makes the following changes to enable
this when HEAT_STANDALONE=True:

- Don't register the orchestration endpoint or create any dedicated
  heat accounts
- Install and configure the heat keystone V2 auth plugin instead of
  the default v3
- set heat.conf [clients_heat] url so that heat can call its own
  API when no orchestration endpoint is registered
- Modify create_userrc.sh to set the required heat client env
  variables to work with the standalone heat

Add ""conductor_affinity"" column to nodes table, containing a reference to the
`id` of the conductor service (not its hostname) that has most recently
performed some action which could require local state to be maintained
(eg, built a PXE config, or started a SOL session).

Using the `id` as a foreign key necessitates not deleting conductors
when unregistering them, but instead marking them offline. This also
helps in determining if a conductor service was only restarted (though
this patch does not implement graceful shutdown).

Thus, this patch also adds an ""online"" boolean column to the conductors
table to track whether a conductor is on- or offline, and updates
the register and unregister methods to use that field transparently.
It may be noted that this does not change the behavior of
register_conductor or unregister_conductor, though an optional
""update_existing"" parameter has been added to register_conductor. This
replaces a DELETE query with an UPDATE query instead.

This patch adds a dependency on the aimonb/aviator module and adds
functionality to support interactions with the OpenStack services' API
via aviator.

The patch adds a parent provider that is intended for other providers
to inherit from. The parent provider has methods to authenticate to
openstack services, create session objects, and make requests. The
authenticate method can accept credentials as an argument hash or infer
credentials from the environment.

It also adds a stub type parameter that allows types to incorporate
basic parameters they need in order to support using aviator.
