At now, security gorup rules are sorted based on ip_protocol and
from_port by default, but there are more higher level classification
like direction and ethertype (like IPv4, IPv6).
This commit improves the default sort order in more meaningful order.

Also improves the handling of IP protocol which can be a string,
an integer or None. Sorting in python 3 assumes all corresponding
values have a same type, so we need to ensure IP protocols in all rules
have a same type, so IP protocol fields are converted into a string
before sorting.

built up a dict of provider summary dict information as well as
constructed the list of ProviderSummary objects that is returned from

A new module-level function _build_provider_summaries() now performs the
construction of ProviderSummary objects from a list of supplied usage

This patch removes the role_name when using openstack_user's :create
action (it gets ignored by the target method).

Note that the spec test would still pass if only the line in
identity_registration.rb (but not the test) were changed, because the
code that actually does grant the role to the resource is executed right
after user creation and before any tests check the resource for the
existence of the role_name attribute. In other words: if the argument
were required in a call but only supplied in another call, the spec
tests would not catch it. Something to watch out for.

The check and gate jobs for cinder-specs were configured to run
py27 unit tests. There is no code in this repo, and the one unit
test we had was a crude attempt to do some rst validation of the

Since this job is configured to skip on doc only changes, that
caused nothing to really happen. The cinder-spec test we had has
now been removed, and the pep8 job has been updated to run doc8
against the spec directory. This switches the configured check
and gate jobs to instead run pep8 so we are able to catch and
prevent formatting errors in new specs.

Release notes are version independent, so remove version/release
values. We've found that projects now require the service package
to be installed in order to build release notes, and this is entirely
due to the current convention of pulling in the version information.

Release notes should not need installation in order to build, so this
unnecessary version setting needs to be removed.

This patch removes the role_name when using openstack_user's :create
action (it gets ignored by the target method).

Note that the spec test would still pass if only the line in
identity_registration.rb (but not the test) were changed, because the
code that actually does grant the role to the resource is executed right
after user creation and before any tests check the resource for the
existence of the role_name attribute. In other words: if the argument
were required in a call but only supplied in another call, the spec
tests would not catch it. Something to watch out for.

In order to make it simpler to use the default
configuration files when deploying services
from source, the files are added to pbr's
data_files section so that the files are
included in the built wheels and therefore
deployed with the code. Packaging and deployment
tools can then more easily use the default files
if they wish to.

files for neutron and the glance metadefs as has
been mentioned in the related bug report.

The job currently fails since pre-run revokes sudo permissions.
We don't need the pre-run, the roles take care of everything, just
remove it.

This syncs the setup with openstack-zuul-jobs.

One could imply a minimum supported database version based on our distro
support policy, but it's also common practice to manage a database tier
separately from an OpenStack installation, so absent explicit language
from OpenStack, it's also reasonable that a deployer could NOT assume
they need a minimum version of a given database.

Add explicit language declaring what the minimum supported versions of
databases are so that projects can know what feature set they can depend
on.

Release notes are version independent, so remove version/release

to be installed in order to build release notes, and this is entirely
due to the current convention of pulling in the version information.

Release notes should not need installation in order to build, so this
unnecessary version setting needs to be removed.

Container deletion was changed from sync to async. If users submit a
request to delete a container, server will response immediately but
the container might not be deleted right away. Users should not assume
the container is deleted unless the container is not shown up in list.

Therefore, the tempest test case need to be updated to deal with this
change. After the delete request is issued, we add logic to wait for
the container to disappear before doing the assertion. This should
fix the intermittent failure of the gate.

The JSON formatter used to rely on services making their logging calls
and passing the context there. A call it expted would be

    LOG.debug(""Some message"", context=context)

This would end up in the ""extra"" section of the logging record. This is
not usually the case, as projects don't always pass the context on that
call. This also applies to the Fluent formatter which is based on the
JSON one.

For the JSON formatter, we already are getting the context from the
record. So lets use that if no context was provided in the record's
'extra' section. Finally, this places the context in its own section,
which is named 'context'.

We should stop the deployment if there is stale puppet-ceph
hieradata because it isn't converted automatically into
ceph-ansible variables.

Initially we only stop the deployment if ceph::profile::params::osds
is found to make sure operators have converted that into a ceph-ansible
parameter and removed it from the Heat environment file.

Release notes are version independent, so remove version/release
values. We've found that projects now require the service package
to be installed in order to build release notes, and this is entirely
due to the current convention of pulling in the version information.

Release notes should not need installation in order to build, so this
unnecessary version setting needs to be removed.

This is needed for new release notes publishing, see

Deployers can change the network that a service is running on through
the ServiceNetMap. A common change is to switch the keystone admin API
to run in the external network instead of the ctlplane network. Doing
this in a TLS everywhere environment breaks, since we were explicitly
skipping the external network.

This no longer skips that network, thus enabling this use-case.

The Ansible actions and DownloadConfig actions both relied on a tmp path
for the working files they saved. This is less than ideal as some of
this data could be sensitive so it should not be stored in /tmp.

Also, the path was unpredictable, making things more difficult from a
user perspective.

This patch adds a work_dir input to these actions and makes use of that
input from the config-download-deploy workflow. The default behavior
when this input is not supplied is the previous behavior to use a
generated path under /tmp.

VPN service status remains in Pending Create after created
and it continues until an IPsec site connection is created
using the VPN service.
This leads to a sitaution that VPN serivce progress bar continues
to be shown forever after creating an IPsec site connection.
It is annoying and confusing because a user expects the progress
bar will disappear soon.

It looks better to disable the status handling in the VPN service
table as a workaround.

Ideally the status transition in VPN service should be revisit.

In stage() method of v2 api, _restore() is called after raising

the exception is raised.

_restore() changes the image_status from 'uploading' to 'queued'

Today the get_extended_resources method of our APIExtensionDescriptor
class does not account for the SUB_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP and as a
result callers of update_attributes_map will also not see the sub
resources.

This patch updates get_extended_resources to include the sub resources
as well.

Note that today in neutron, we have both uses:
- neutron.extensions.qos.Qos.get_extended_resources uses sub resources.
- neutron.extensions.flavors.Flavors.get_extended_resources does not
use the sub resource map.

In addition this patch changes the methods defined in the
APIExtensionDescriptor to be class methods rather than instance methods.
There is no real instance data to maintain and in addition consumers
need a way to access the update_attributes_map method without having
to import and create a concrete neutron extension instance [1].

One patch [1] introduced a bug on the locking mechanism. Since there
were no unit tests that covered it and there were no tests to catch
this. This patch adds the corresponding test and fixes the bug.

Current tests always dynamically create accounts when running.

These tests do not run when, for example, LDAP is configured.

This change allows murano_tempest_tests to correctly interpret
use_dynamic_credentials config in the [auth] section of tempest.conf

When use_dynamic_credentials is set to True, dynamic accounts will be created.
When set to false, pre-provisioned accounts specified in
accounts.yaml Tempest config will be used.

This patch refactors the code that deals with setting BIOS settings to use
code in common with setting iDRAC card settings.

Previously, set_bios_settings returned commit_required, which was actually
set to indicate if a reboot of the server was required.  The response to a
SetAttributes call to an iDRAC returns two different values, one that
indicates if a configuration job needs to be created, and another that
indicates if the server needs to be rebooted.  The new code returns
is_commit_required and is_reboot_required which are respectively set to these
values.  For backwards compatibility, the code continues to return
commit_required, but this parameter should be considered deprecated and it
will be removed in a future release.

This code hasn't worked for over two years when
9ed9ab68f7d2fb98c505afc3a1079a72f15c959c was added
which does API version discovery, which requires auth,
which happens before the SecretsHelper is used. That was
back in the 2.27.0 release in the Liberty series.

Given how long this has been broken without anyone noticing,
and it's undocumented and untested (basically), and
python-openstackclient properly handles prompting for a password,
we should just remove this code rather than try to fix it.

- adds more irrelevant files to the list
- removes requirements.txt from the list of irrelevant files, since

Release notes are version independent, so remove version/release
values. We've found that projects now require the service package
to be installed in order to build release notes, and this is entirely
due to the current convention of pulling in the version information.

Release notes should not need installation in order to build, so this
unnecessary version setting needs to be removed.

This is needed for new release notes publishing, see

During a rebuild we bypass the scheduler because we are
always rebuilding the instance on the same host it's already
on. However, we allow passing a new image during rebuild
and that new image needs to be validated to work with the
instance host by running it through the scheduler filters,
like the ImagePropertiesFilter. Otherwise the new image
could violate constraints placed on the host by the admin.

This change checks to see if there is a new image provided
and if so, modifies the request spec passed to the scheduler
so that the new image is validated all while restricting
the scheduler to still pick the same host that the instance
is running on. If the image is not valid for the host, the
scheduler will raise NoValidHost and the rebuild stops.

A functional test is added to show the recreate of the bug
and that we probably stop the rebuild now in conductor by
calling the scheduler to validate the image.

Closes-Bug: #1664931

NOTE(mriedem): There were a few changes needed for Newton:

1. There is no PlacementFixture but it's not needed.
2. The API client needs to have the microversion set from
   the test.
3. The enabled_filters config option wasn't in Newton.
4. The scheduler has to be started before compute otherwise
   we get a MessagingTimeout due to the CastAsCall fixture
   during the compute startup.

Previously, provisioning network ports were only deleted during a
successful deployment, when the node's network is flipped from the
provisioning network to the tenant network. In many failure scenarios
this code path would not be reached, as well as the case of aborting
deployment. This is not normally an issue, because during instance
termination, nova deletes all ports with a device ID matching the
instance's UUID, including any remaining provisioning ports.

This change removes the provisioning network ports when tearing down a
node to ensure that they are deleted in all scenarios.

We're seeing excessive amount of failures on this job due what appears
to be a performance regression. As this has been an on-going issue for
over a week, we need to temporarily switch scenario001 to non-voting
while we continue to troubleshoot.  This change should be reverted ASAP
when the cause is identified and fixed.

When using environments/docker.yaml however it will get set
to puppet/service/docker.yaml which will facilitate installing
the Docker service early in the deployment at step 1.

Now for many objects deletion operation consists of two
steps:
1. Check that the object we want to delete exists (SELECT)
2. Delete the object (DELETE)

It's not really rational, so we can skip the first step and
delete the objects directly.

Tests showed that average execution time of delete_* functions
decrease by 4 times, from 2.5 ms to 0.6 ms.

Since function 'delete_delayed_call' is called quite often during
the execution (normally 5 times per second), this change improves the
performance noticiably.

invasive change with the aim of making it possible to use openstacksdk

It's probably not going to pass tests until the last patch, but is broken
out so that it's easier to read. Before we merge it, we'll want to squash
(there is no value in fixing mocks to deal with intermediary states if
