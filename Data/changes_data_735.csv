This patch enables all of the features for the Flavors panel to use Angular but
disables it, so that it is easy to switch on/off.

Note that we add integration test switches since it can't read the Django
conf.

Note that I changed the common tests to allow for testing of api calls that
don't produce error toasts, because we needed better branch coverage, and
the deleteFlavor api wasn't fully branch-tested.

- The Admin panel doesn't show *all* images, just those either in the current
  project or exposed as public (same as Project). (Travis)

  FIX: The Admin panel now supplies is_public: None as the Python code does,
  which allows all images to be shown.

- The 'Is Public' attribute is in the drawer now (even on large screen sizes)
and we can't sort by shared, public etc, as far as I can tell. I don't think
we specifically need the buttons like the previous design had, but it feels
like a regression to have no filtering or sorting on that field? Perhaps
someone with better glance knowledge could correct me.

  FIX: Added 'visibility' as a synthesized field and added as a facet, making
  sure to use the current project to correctly identify 'Shared with Project'.
  Did *not* add 'Is Public' as that is a vestigial concept.

- Create/Edit Image > Image Details tab needs help text. Create has some info,
but Edit has nothing really. Also, we can drop that ""description"" header in
the help text; it doesnt add any value. This would be a nice improvement over
the Python version for novice users, and shouldnt take long to enter - just
pull info from the API docs.

  NO CHANGE: Let's not block enablement on verbiage. I think we need a better
  consistency and I don't believe the last-minute is the best time to add this
  because it's very easy to create/find nits.

- Create Volume help text is also entirely blank. We should fill that out
with some useful instructions, IMO.

  FIX: Added basic help text.

- Create Volume should default to the first Availability Zone if there is
only one, as it is a required field anyway.

  FIX: I added logic for this, and also added in some test features so we don't
  lose coverage.

- The Image Details page now longer lists the owner ID. I don't think this
is addressed by Travis' patch either.

  FIX: This is now under the 'Security' heading.

- Kernel ID and Ramdisk ID seem empty in angular image details, but populated
in the python equivalent.

  FIX: This was a regression that this patch fixes.

- Why are created/updated/ID separated into ""Record Properties""? Is there
something in the API about this, or is it just a presentation construct?

  CHANGE: Moved into the general 'Image' header.  Added a filter so that these
  can be implemented as basic property registrations.

- I think 'Filename' in angular image details can be hidden if empty.

  CHANGE: Instead of hiding, we can show the standard '-' if no filename.

If the user's private network has the same CIDR as the public

Since large Glance images even temporarily stored on dashboard side
tend to fill up Web Server filesystem, it is desirable to route image
payload directly to Glance service (which usually streams it to
storage backend, which in turn has plenty of space).

To make it possible we need to trick Django into thinking that a file
was selected inside FileInput, while its contents are not actually
transferred to Django server. Then, once image is created client-side
code needs to know the exact url the image payload needs to be
transferred to. Both tasks are solved via using ExternalFileField /
ExternalUploadMeta classes which allow to work around the usual Django
form processing workflow with minimal changes to CreateImage form
business logic.

The client-side code relies on CORS being enabled for Glance service
(otherwise browser would forbid the PUT request to a location
different from the one form content came from). In a Devstack setup
you'll need to edit [cors] section of glance-api.conf file, setting
`allowed_origin` setting to the full hostname of the web server (say,
http://<HOST_IP>/dashboard) and restart glance-api process.

A progress bar is implemented to track the progress of a file upload,
in case a really huge image is transferred.

The new machinery could be easily switched on/off with a single
setting `HORIZON_IMAGES_UPLOAD_MODE` set to 'direct' / 'legacy'.

Horizon radio buttons were using the standard browser radio buttons.
The default radio buttons have been altered to allow for a highly
customized experience through the use of CSS pseudo elements and
Icon Fonts. This allows the color, size, and unselected and selected
states of the checkbox to be altered. The 'default' theme uses the
standard Font Awesome radio button icons. The 'material' theme uses
the Material Design radio buttons. It was noted, during this refactor,
that there was an error in the _themable_checkbox template. This has
been fixed.

First, now there are 2 '/api/glance/images/ API wrapper endpoints for
creating a new image - POST and PUT. The POST endpoint which existed
before now resides at PUT. This was done to support legacy
(i.e. proxied by web-server) file uploads in Angular Create Image,
because Django (which we need to use in that case) doesn't correctly
process PUT request. So, if local file binary payload is added to the
form contents, we send it using POST request.

Second, speaking of '/api/glance/images' PUT request previously known
as POST... Where before the POST call to Horizon REST API wrappers
returned the final image object that Glance just created, now there
are two possibilities for what happens after PUT is sent.

* When Create Image form Source Type is set to URL, then everything is
  going as before.
* When Source Type is set to File, then just a file name instead of an
  actual Blob is sent to '/api/glance/images', then the Glance Image
  is queued for creation and Horizon web-server responds with an Image
  object which dict() representation has 2 additional keys:
  'upload_url' and 'token_id'. The 'upload_url' tells the location for
  the subsequent CORS request, while 'token_id' is passed as a header
  in that request, so Keystone would let it in. CORS upload is started
  immediately as Image is queued for creation (first promise is
  resolved) and returns the second promise, which is resolved once the
  upload finishes. The modal form hangs until second promise resolves
  to indicate that upload is in progress. Upload progress notification
  is added in a follow-up patch.

DEPLOY NOTES

The client-side code relies on CORS being enabled for Glance service
(otherwise browser would forbid the PUT request to a location
different from the one form content came from). In a Devstack setup
you'll need to edit [cors] section of glance-api.conf file, setting
`allowed_origin` setting to the full hostname of the web server (say,
http://<HOST_IP>/dashboard).

In the django tables, if a resource goes into a transitional-state
(think building, deleting, shutting-down, ...) the table would highlight
that behavior with 2 changes:
A) the row would be highlighted
B) a barber-pole would show up in the status column

The new-ish registry-based hz-resource-table wasn't making either of
those visual changes.  But now it is!  Hurray for fewer regressions!

This patch adds Angular Schema Form[1] and its requirements to Horizon.
There are a number of advantages to this over the current methods of
defining forms and workflows:

- All fields have an individual template, making theming improvements,
  bug fixes, and bootstrap conformity easier.
- The file and line count, especially for workflows, is dramatically
  reduced. The Create Net workflow, for example, goes from 12+ files to
  2, with a big reduction in boilerplate HTML.
- All field validation messages are standardised, so we can match them
  across Horizon and plugins

What this patch contains:
- Many common form fields, including things like the themable checkboxes
  and selects.
- A basic modal template that can be passed with ui-bootstraps $modal
  service to take advantage of schema-form

Next steps:
- Remove the other modal templates so we can standardise. A single
  template opened from the $modal service is fine, and we shouldn't need
  several directives. In this case, we should deprecate them, as the
  modal forms will be used elsewhere.
- Map commonly used form items, like transfer tables, to a schema form
  type like array (they serve similar purposes, so maybe thats what
  should be replaced)
- Use themable selects instead of regular ones

This patch follows on the example that the Containers set, providing
a 'switch' in the panel-enablement file that currently defaults to
'legacy' (Python-based Images panel) and allows for 'angular' (Angular-
based Images panel).

To be clear, this does NOT enable Angular Images.  It's just setting the
stage to do so at some point, or to allow deployers/devs to easily switch
between the two.

A switch both for HORIZON_CONFIG and for integration tests is necessary
due to the way integration tests operate.

---
Includes numerous bug fixes to hz-dynamic-table and friends to be
responsive to dynamic table configurations or trackBy expressions.
---

Some resource types (like subnets) can only be listed for a given
parent container (like networks). This patch modifies the
hz-resource-table to allow a user to pass in extra paramters that
will be passed to the list function for a given resource type.

For example usage: See DNSaaS
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/341182/9/designatedashboard/static/designatedashboard/resources/os-designate-recordset/details/zone-recordsets.html

For example:
This allows hz-resource-table to be used to show a list of subnets
as one of the details views for a network. The details view
controller passes in the current network ID as an extra paramter
to the hz-resource-table, which in turn, supplies that value to
the subnets list function.  The subnets list function can use
the parameters it is given to build the appropriate API call.

This is very similar to what already exists to pass server search
parameters from magic search to the API in the angular images
table.

This patch provides a shared mock object for $window/window.

window is a native object, not javascript object, and $window
is a wrapper for it. when changing property or invake methods
on it will cause the test runner environment change. And because
it is native, Jasmine cannot spy on those native methods. This
mock resolve the problems.

This mock is available to all the spec files via a very augular
way.

This patch also try to establish a structured approach to
write mock objects:

* mocks should reside in ``.mock.js`` files and be loaded only
  in test runner pages.
* mocks should be loaded after production code files, and before
  spec code files.
* mocks should be sharable between specs.
* mocks should not belong to specs, they should have a 1:1 relationship
  with the object it try to mock.
* mocks should be at a level as low as possible, maybe where JavaScript
  cannot reach directly.
* mocks must be tested theme self.
* mocks should be easy to find, use and manage.

- Is the library actively maintained?

  The last PyPI release was in December of 2015 but the source
  repository [1] has been committed to as recently as December of 2016.

- Is the library good code?

  Yes. It's well tested and they use Travis CI for continuous testing.
  They also have 96% test coverage.

- Is the library python 3 compatible?

  Yes. They support Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5. They do not seem
  to have started testing against 3.6.

- Is the library license compatible?

  Yes. It's licensed as BSD.

- Is the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu
  latest / Fedora latest)?

  Ubuntu: Yes [2]
  Fedora: Yes [3]
  Gentoo: Yes [4]
  SUSE: No

- Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries
  in ``global-requirements.txt``?

  No. There's nothing comparable in global-requirements.txt

- Is the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or
  infrastructure setup? (Answer to this should be Yes, of course)
  Which?

  Yes. Craton. We opted into the global requirements sync job and it has
  been failing due to this being a requirement that we were using prior
  to opting in. See bug 1656541 for more details.

Heat wants to use 'novaclient.v2.servers.

It's better to change the method to public for

1. add public method named get_console_url() for class
   'novaclient.v2.servers.Server'
2. rename _console() to get_console_url() for class

This fix solves a LUN attachment error for Ubuntu on s390 host setups. Fiber
Channel requires a path for discovery of new devices, and Ubuntu uses a
different format than previously assumed. This can be solved by simply adding
the Ubuntu-style path to the list of possible paths, since they get quietly
dropped if they lead nowhere in FibreChannelConnector._get_possible_volume_paths
anyways.

Infernalis release of Ceph switched to running the ceph daemons
under the ceph:ceph user instead of root:root. The upgrade OSD
logic does not take this into conideration and blindly runs the
recursive chown for whatever the current user is expected to be
when the upgrade is run.

This is problematic in production clusters with large numbers of
objects stored across 10 or more OSDs as this will cause a walk
of all the inodes under /var/lib/ceph unnecessarily. This change
ensures that the chown is only done when the upgrade target is
Jewel (Ubuntu Cloud Archives do not contain Infernalis release).

devstack-tools is a port of some of the more complicated bash code in
devstack to python clis to simplify the maintenance of these. The
initial focus is modification of conf files, including the devstack
local.conf files. It is needed to support local.conf in the gate, and
as such will need to be ported back to all stable trees in

With the advent of different clouds running tests in the gate,
resize-volume and resize-instance have been failing sporadically. With
the sheer number of jobs that trove runs, the odds of having these tests
pass has dropped to almost zero. In order to facilitate the test runs
passing, these tests have be limited to just MySQL.

They can be re-enabled once the bugs have been fixed. Note that
the issues may be in the neutron devstack setup (or something
related to xenial) and not in the trove code specifically.

Note that the way the groups are set up, instance_error
and isntance_force_delete are also relegated to MySQL only.
Since these are datastore agnostic tests, that should
not be a problem.

Today each 3rd party vendor uses a piecemeal approach when running
3rd party CI to test their solution against neutron changes.

What I mean by this is that each project uses a huge regex that
cherry picks only a handful of tests [1,2,3]. This approach has
a number of drawbacks:

a) it is prone to causing coverage holes if tests are renamed
   (tracking the idempotent IDs is not exactly user friendly);
b) there is no common standard that can be used to assess
   apples with apples (e.g. ML2 driver A with ML2 driver B)
c) it encourages projects to settle with the minimun set of
   passing tests to keep their CI green, rather than promoting
   an objective to be fulfilled.
d) I think I can come up with more, but I am ok for now...

This patch proposes a labeling convention to be used for 3rd party
validation. Once (and if) labels are agreed on and added to existing
tests, each 3rd party vendor can choose what level of CI validation
it wants to achieve by simply specifying the labels. Even though
vendors get to opt-in the labels, all tests associated to the labels
must run for the test category to be considered exercised.

Besides the benefit of addressing drawbacks a-d as mentioned above,
this approach empowers the neutron team to advise what level of
validation is expected by a specific driver so that it can be considered
'integrated' with neutron.

This is just a rough idea, posted here for early feedback right
after the summit.

Bear in mind, that this effort is somewhat orthogonal to DefCore, as
the former has a lot broader scope, wider visibility and slower dynamics.

Feedback welcome.

As mentioned several other places, this is not something
that should be enabled by default. The input to this
functionality is backend specific. The issue is not that
""only a few Cinder backends support"" it, but that the test
is flawed in assuming everything doing manage/unmanage
will take the same values to identify the volume or
snapshot to be managed.

This is causing many third party CI failures and should
be reverted back to defaulting to false.

time creating a lot of networks and ports.  In addition, OVB now
has the ability to deploy a network environment that supports
basic bonding, and this change adds support for deploying that as
well.  No jobs currently use bonding, but that will be added in a

When running by hand it's very easy for a user to
not take the very critical step of updating ironic from system
to session.  This change makes oooq a little less error prone.

For instance.. if the first attempt of installing the undercloud
failed a dev may rerun it from the script in /home/stack and
move on to undercloud-post w/o updating ironic.  By putting
it directly in the post script it's slightly idiot proof.

Consider using crudini here vs. sed:

A couple of small changes intended to make it easier to debug
failures in the gate.  First, run nova service-list and
neutron agent-list after failures to create the ping test stack,
not just after a failure to ping the vm.  A service outage could
also cause a stack create failure.

Second, sort the rpm -qa output for easier comparing between
different runs of a job.  Otherwise it seems to come out in a
semi-random order that doesn't diff nicely.

'refresh_dhcp_helper', which is called after subnet update/create
notifications in the DHCP agent, can end up retrieving ports that
the agent hadn't yet seen. It will then configure those ports but
not notify the server that they are ready.

Unless the port is subsequently updated on the server afterwards to
generate a new port update notification, the DHCP agent won't ever tell
the server that the port has had DHCP provisioned. This led to the
bug this closes. Another patch[1] that removed excessive DHCP ready
notifications uncovered this bug.

This patch just adjusts refresh_dhcp_helper to ensure that all ports
are marked as ready after configuring them all.

The ceph project has focussed on running the RADOS Gateway using
the embedded civetweb engine for many cycles now; mod-fastcgi is
buggy and no longer provided in Ubuntu as of 17.04, so switch to
always running in embedded mode.

Existing installs will be upgraded to run in this mode, purging
apache related packaging and configuration.

Earlier Image and Zunservice classes were used to validate
the request body for the Image and Services operations.
After moving the validation to JSON schema validator,
it has no major use case. So this patch removes the Image
and ZunService class and moves the logic to represent
images in to 'views' folder.

In ci there's no reason to wait for a grub prompt when booting
instances, so let's make use of the new config knob added in
I556b3f48eff1b67ee8c4b9b64f749af95100fb99 to set it to 0.

Note that this is ci-specific.  In real deployments there may be
reasons to want access to the grub prompt, so I don't think we
should shut it off by default in the image build.

SystemExit exception is usually raised by signal handlers
and then caught in main thread to handle signal. Signal
handler executes in main threads but if we use eventlet
we have ony one thread and signal handler can interrupt
any greenlet. Therefore we need to re-raise this exception
to catch it in main greenlet at last.

Also it is necessary to keep executor working and continue
processing scheduled tasks because signal handling logic may
wait for some job results

Apt cannot have 2 mirrors with the same content in 2 different files.
If a deployer has an apt mirror with uca, the deployer
still need to add a repository, but will also need to define the
filename used, in order to avoid clashes.

This commit makes possible to allow the definition of a filename for
the repositories, but also keeps the current Newton behavior.

is in line with what has been done in other repos, like galera_server.

process_spawn module is used in netns-cleanup functional tests. This
module forks processes which will listen on random ports/sockets.
Due to the lack of randomness on how get_free_namespace_port() from
net_helpers was used, all forked processes got the same sequence of
ports to bind on. This led to a race condition and some stayed
alive without actually listening on any port/socket.

Also, the ignore_sigterm feature wasn't handled properly and parent
always died after a SIGTERM which caused the test to fail when the
above condition happened since netns-cleanup wasn't able to find its
parent and kill the process which failed to bind.

During a convergence check operation, we should never load resources from
the database. However, all resources will inevitably be created whenever we
do stack[some_resource]. Previously, resources not represented in the
cached data (i.e. the ones we were least interested in) would get loaded
from the database when this occurred.

This change ensures that only the resource being checked is loaded from the
database, as intended, and adds asserts to prevent any future regression
occurring silently.

services as the libraries themselves are listed in upper-constraints.txt
which leads to errors that you can't install a specific version and a
constrained version.

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper script to
edit the constraints to remove os-brick.

Finally, it also adds libxml2 and libxslt to bindep.txt for use when
building cryptography.

'refresh_dhcp_helper', which is called after subnet update/create
notifications in the DHCP agent, can end up retrieving ports that
the agent hadn't yet seen. It will then configure those ports but
not notify the server that they are ready.

Unless the port is subsequently updated on the server afterwards to
generate a new port update notification, the DHCP agent won't ever tell
the server that the port has had DHCP provisioned. This led to the
bug this closes. Another patch[1] that removed excessive DHCP ready
notifications uncovered this bug.

This patch just adjusts refresh_dhcp_helper to ensure that all ports
are marked as ready after configuring them all.

An interface's name is limited to INTERFACE_MAX_SIZE. In some cases, IP
utils truncate this name automatically. In Ubuntu Xenial, ip link
returns an error instead of this behaviour.

This change truncates the device's name upon read (The full name is
still stored on the object). This way, the code does not rely on IP
utils to do the truncation. This solves the error in the test.

apply_filters_to_query was performing an outerjoin to rbac_entries
unconditionally when model_query could have already performed an
outerjoin (if the request was from an unprivileged user) and/or when
the join wasn't even necessary (the '?shared=False' query that uses
a subquery and not a join). This resulted in terrible performance
because of cartesian products of rbac entries with themselves.

This fixes the issue by ensuring there is only an outerjoin to the
rbac table if it's going to be used for a filter condition and it's
not already joined because of a query scope imposed due to the user
not being privileged.

Unfortunately this doesn't include tests to prevent regressions because
we don't have any methods for testing the performance of individual
queries.

By mistake, os-brick passes 'rescan_attempts' instead of
'retry_attempts' to the 'ensure_lun_available' method.

The os-brick patch adding this behavior has merged as our CI

Since os-brick is the only place where this argument is used,
we'll rename it here in order to get this fix released faster,
especially considering that this also breaks our Nova driver.

This patch ensure the local host's ansible facts are used for the
""ansible_architecture"" fact, rather than the ""physical_host"". Since we
don't explicitly collect facts for ""physical_host"", and the
ansible_architecture fact is set for the local host container, we
don't need to try to retrieve the ""physical_host"" facts.

A new var ""galera_package_arch"" is created so that the architecture can
be overriden if it isn't being calculated correctly. Additionally, the
duplicate vars that are not specific to distributions have been moved
into defaults, and out of the specific distribution vars files.

When we create a pacemaker resource it must happen from a single node.
If it happens from multiple nodes an immediate error will be returned by
pcs.

For the pacemaker roles we enforce this by leveraging the recently
introduced <SERVICE_NAME_bootstrap_short_node_name> which gives us
the first hostname per-service, regardless of the role.
(introduced via I03e8685f939e8ae1fcd8b16883b559615042505d)

With this approach if a pacemaker service belongs to two different
roles (say role Controller on node A and role galera on node B), it
will only create the resource from one of the two and not both (which
would return an error).

Only setting Partial-Bug for this one, because it addresses the issue
from the pacemaker resource creation POV (which is always affected). But
the issue itself is a race that we're theoretically affected by since
the composable roles work landed. While I have tried to fix the more
general case in previous attempts, I think it is best if we start a
discussion on how to fix it, because each approach has a bunch of
potential drawbacks and is quite invasive on how we do things. A
discussion slot for this has been proposed for the Atlanta PTG.

A simple experiment showed that all calls to OneView were calling for
authentication. Reviewing the code, I perceived that every single call to
python-oneviewclient were creating a new instance of the client, which
authenticated again and generated a new session token on OneView.

This patch aims to reuse oneview_client instances when possible, avoiding
to create unecessary new sessions that can be reused.

In case of ssh failure, it may be that network connectivity is ok,
but ssh is not authorised. If the problem is related to ssh key
injection, using CirrOS stock ssh password may allow fetching some
more logs to understand what went wrong.

Upstream patch I8990ce21745fa7a995b92ed337622fa6ffc2756b can not
be backported to mitaka because of backward compatibilty issues, hence
we need additional fix for stable/mitaka in library.
But still we can manually disable creation of Nova v3 endpoint.

Combine all cinder_volume host's ""cinder_backends"" var to ensure all

the same backend for multiple hosts (e.g. rbd backends which exist on
multiple volume servers).

This adds a second cinder_volume node for testing, with a new backend,
as well as the old backend - this should ensure duplicate backends are
not created whilst backends are created for each cinder_volumes host.
