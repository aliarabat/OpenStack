After microversion 3.48 service_uuid and shared_targets are added to
the body of volume_detail, and microversion is not used in resource_setup
for now, so the result of show_volume in resource_setup doesn't contain
service_uuid and shared_targets, but the result of list_volume(detail=True)
in testcases contains those fields, so the matching fails.

So we should create and get volume details in setUp in order to use the
same microversion as in testcases till microversion support in
resource_setup is fulfilled.

We validate the boot interface during adoption because of:
a) potential rebuilding,
b) non-local boot.

Rebuild proved a rarely used feature, and local boot is the default
nowadays, so it makes less sense to unconditionally validate the boot
interface during adoption. We will run the validation anyway the next
time we need to do something with booting.

Similarly, do not record is_whole_disk_image None if it cannot be
reliably determined.

On series-upgrade the g-s-s stopped syncing due python packages required
by the sync file (that is run in the context of the unit, rather than
the charm) not being present.  I believe they may have been removed
during the series-upgrade when unused packages were removed.

This patch ensures that on both upgrade and series upgrade, all the
packages that are needed are installed.

We validate the boot interface during adoption because of:
a) potential rebuilding,
b) non-local boot.

Rebuild proved a rarely used feature, and local boot is the default
nowadays, so it makes less sense to unconditionally validate the boot
interface during adoption. We will run the validation anyway the next
time we need to do something with booting.

Similarly, do not record is_whole_disk_image None if it cannot be
reliably determined.

We have seen issues that the Neutron Server was not
able to respond in time during the creation of Ports
in bulk. In order to avoid this type of failures and
improve time taken for Pods to be created, this commit
includes a lock that will only allow one population to
happen at time for a specific pool, instead of controling
all the pools population with the frequency setting.

Nova-ssh is used via the remotefs calls in nova.  This method implements
bascially 4 commands.  To limit the security risk of allowing password
less ssh access between compute nodes for remotefs puproses we should do
sanity checking of the commands that are coming though ssh.

In practice we only need to implement touch, rm, scp and mkdir.  So we
have created a wrapper that will only allow these commands to run and
attempts to ""defang"" options passed to them as well.

One can create attachments to a server via Cinder api.
So volume can have multiple attachments with
the same server made via Cinder and Nova apis.
Nova doesn't know about attachments created via
Cinder api and doesn't think that volume attached to server.
After volume was attached and detached via
Nova api, a volume still has bogus
attachments to the server and is 'in-use'.
Volume cannot be deleted.
Patch makes volume dettachment to delete all attachments
with the same server.

We validate the boot interface during adoption because of:
a) potential rebuilding,
b) non-local boot.

Rebuild proved a rarely used feature, and local boot is the default
nowadays, so it makes less sense to unconditionally validate the boot
interface during adoption. We will run the validation anyway the next
time we need to do something with booting.

Similarly, do not record is_whole_disk_image None if it cannot be
reliably determined.

Items that are skipped are placed on a deferred queue. But if everything
in that queue is waiting then we want to sleep the minimum amount of
time.

This patch replaces the deque with a priority queue. The updates are
added (next_action, put_time, update). The priority queue will sort
theses by the next_action. Which means when we get an update off the
deferred queue. If the next_action is > time.now() we need to sleep for
that long.

There is a chance there are a bunch of updates set at the same
next_action time, those following will be dropped and requeued on the
deferred queue and the next_action time for that container.

Because the updates are now prioritised, popping the front wont
neccessarly be the oldest update. So this patch reverts back to stop
filling the queue once it's full. Having said that, I have now had to
add a put timestamp, so this could probably reinstate to pop the oldest
update again.

The put_time timestamp is the time it was added to the deferred
queue. This was added later in the game because a heap can't compare
dicts, so when were are a bunch of updates at the same next_action the
heap can fail, as it then compares the next value in the tuple. Fixing
this was either moving to an update class (so we can __lt__). Or adding
the put timestamp to keep each unique. The latter, not only is less code,
but also means in a future patchset we can use it to pop the oldest
waiting update from the queue.

In ""DbQuotaNoLockDriver"", when a new reservation is being made,
first the expired reservations are removed. That guarantees the
freshness of the existing reservations.

In systems with high concurrency of operations, the
""DbQuotaNoLockDriver.make_reservation"" method will be called in
parallel. The expired reservations removal implies a deletion
on the ""reservation"" table that could be executed by several
workers at the same time (in the same controller or not). That
could lead to a ""DBDeadlock"" exception if multiple workers want
to delete the same registers.

In case an API worker receives this exception, it should continue
as the expired reservations have been deleted by other worker. It
should not retry this operation.

If the reservations are not deleted, the quota engine will filter
out those expired reservations when counting the current number of
reservations [1][2][3]. That means even if in a particular request
the expired reservations are not deleted, these won't count in the
resource quota calculation.

The default reservation expiration timeout is set to 120 seconds
(as it should have been initially set) that is the default
expiration delta for a reservation since 2015.

This commit implements adding Events for various things that may happen
when Kuryr handles a Service - either incidents or just informative
messages helpful to the user.

As to add an Event it is required to have a uid of the object and in
most of KuryrLoadBalancerHandler we don't have the Service
representation, this commit implements populating ownerReferences of the
KuryrLoadBalancer object with a reference to the Service. This has a
major side effect that KLB will be garbage collected if corresponding
service doesn't exist, which is probably a good thing (and we manage
that ourselves using finalizers anyway).

Another set of refactorings is to remove KLB creation from
EndpointsHandler in order to stop it fighting with ServiceHandler over
creation - EndpointsHandler cannot add ownerReference as it has no uid
of the Service.

Other refactorings related to the error messages are also included.

The proxy-server puts shard ranges into memcache to avoid making a GET
request to container servers on every object PUT for the purposes of
directing object updates to the correct shard. On the occasions when
the memcache entry has expired and the proxy does make a GET request
to the container server, a container server under extreme load may not
respond in a timely way. A primary container server may eventually
respond to the proxy GET requests, but the proxy will have timed out,
gone to handoffs and given up on the primary container server GET.

This has two undesirable consequences: the proxy cannot repopulate
memcache with shard ranges; object updates default to being
directed to the root container, therefore placing more load on the
already busy container servers.

This patch enables the container server to set shard ranges into
memcache if it has access to the memcache pool. That way, even when
container server responses are slow and the proxy times out, the shard
ranges may still make it to memcache for subsequent proxy requests to
use.

the required minversion has to be bumped, too.

Using rows.values() via the ovsdbapp API is inherently
racy as if there are multiple threads an add/delete can
interfere, triggering a RuntimeError (dictionary changed
size during iteration).

In one case we now directly use lookup() as we were
looking for a specific logical router.

In the other two cases we create a new class to do the
operation in a transaction, making it idempotent, since
both need to iterate the returned list.

Also changed the IDL notify code to use a frozen row to
similary avoid any possible race condition with there.

In Triple-O, secure rbac overrides ensure that all service API
and resource RBAC policies do not enforce scope checks;
manila's ""context_is_admin"" rule is used by manila as a short
hand for checking the admin role in most ""system"" level operations.

Since tripleo deployments won't be enforcing scope yet, this
policy rule must be overridden to allow users with the admin role.

When SRBAC is enforced(*1), keystone requires one of the following
conditions for validate token api.
 1) The user has the service role assigned
 2) The user is a system reader
 3) The user generated the token

When authtoken middleware validates tokens in requests, it uses service
users to call the validate_token API of Keystone. In this case
the condition 3 is never met(The token is generated by an external user
while it is validated by the service user used in API). In addition,
currently all credentials used for authtoken middleware are
project-scoped, not system-scoped, so condition 2 is never met(*2) if
SRBAC is enforced.

This change adds the project-scoped service role to all service
users so that all service users can use the validate_token API even
if SRBAC is enforced. An alternative approach would be assign
the system-scoped reader role for these users and replace credentials
for authtoken middleware by system scoped one, but we are likely to
need additional considerations to establish proper design of
system-scoped role assignment.

(*1)
When scope evaluation is enforced(enforce_scope=True) and new rules
are enforced(enforce_new_defaults=True)

(*2)
There are a few exceptions like the nova user which already have
the project-scoped service role to use the service token feature.

There is a race condition between an incoming resize and an
update_available_resource periodic in the resource tracker. The race
window starts when the resize_instance RPC finishes  and ends when the
finish_resize compute RPC finally applies the migration context on the
instance.

In the race window, if the update_available_resource periodic is run on
the destination node, then it will see the instance as being tracked on
this host as the instance.node is already pointing to the dest. But the
instance.numa_topology still points to the source host topology as the
migration context is not applied yet. This leads to CPU pinning error if
the source topology does not fit to the dest topology. Also it stops the
periodic task and leaves the tracker in an inconsistent state. The
inconsistent state only cleanup up after the periodic is run outside of
the race window.

This patch applies the migration context temporarily to the specific
instances during the periodic to keep resource accounting correct.

Add a new option `eventloop_in_pthread` to the amqp1 driver.  The
default value is False.  When enabled, this forces the driver
eventloop thread to run in a real pthread, regardless of the
containing execution model.

This option should be set to False in most circumstances.  At the time
of this writing, the only common scenario to enable this option is
when running nova-api under mod_wsgi/uWSGI.  This is because:

* nova-api uses eventlet for its execution model
* nova-api monkey-patches ""thread""

In this circumstance, the eventloop runs in a greenthread and can only
be scheduled for execution during the processing of an active wsgi
request.  Because heartbeat packets are scheduled and sent by the
eventloop, idle workers will not be able to heartbeat and will thus
repeatedly disconnect and reconnect their AMQP connection needlessly.

With the option enabled, it forces the eventloop into a real pthread
which is scheduled normally by the operating system and is not tied to
the lifecycle of in-flight wsgi requests.  This allows heartbeats to
continue processing, even when the wsgi workers are idle.

The _validate_passwords_file validation avoids the user to perform

However, when performing an upgrade the undercloud-upgrade-ephimeral-heat.yaml
template will be always used, which will invoke the

is properly migrated to run with heat-ephimeral. Therefore, it does not make
sense to halt the upgrade if the migration will take place of generating that

This fixes/deprecates these parameters. The details are as follows.

1) url
This option is fixed and now overrides the endpoint url which Manila
uses to connect neutron. Default of the url option is changed to keep
the existing behavior by default.

2) url_timeout
This option is just deprecated, because there is already the timeout
parameter in keystoneauth to define request timeout.

3) auth_strategy
This option is also deprecated. The auth mechanism should be defined
by the auth_type parameter in keystoneauth instead.

Add a specific marker (directory name) to the blockinfile to avoid
deletion for any updates of the execution.

Currently, to configure the ironic integration backup. There is a
need of a backup data server (nfs) and the ironic PXE boot files
on the undercloud. If the backup data server is going to be on the
undercloud. We basically execute twice the nfs server configuration
with the data backup directory and the ironic configuration. The
way that we configure the nfs server, the blockinfile is overwritten.
So only the last configuration remains.

This patch aims to modify the blockinfile only when the directory
matches. For two different directories, it will create two
blockinfile blocks.

Changes CephFS driver to do not try to escape export ip in case it
is a hostname. The CephFS driver might use the hostname as an
export ip in case no ``cephfs_ganesha_server_ip`` is configured.
If that happens, we should not be allowing ip validations to occur
uppon a hostname, because it differs from an IPv4 or IPv6 and that
isn't necessarily an issue.

It moves the EL8 and EL9 packages into two conditional
and also introduces python_version for both EL versions.

https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/python-tripleoclient/+/807098
adds the support for passing extra parameters and based on those
parameter above distro and python version conditionals
will be evaluated.

Since collectd packages and qdrouterd packages are not available
currently so are restricting to EL8.

Note: /usr/share/zoneinfo comes from tzdata and this directory
does not exists on base image. On reinstalling in a running
container, the directory exists but on a image it does not
exists. So In order to fix it, we are removing the tzdata
rpm and reinstalling it as a workaround.

To avoid intermittent failures and job timeouts
in scenario jobs, move these jobs to nested virt nodes.

Only moving scenario jobs as those are mostly affected
by intermittent issues(SSH Tempest failures) and job
timeouts. Also nested virt nodes are provided only by a
few nodepool providers.

Also switching non-scenario jobs to use cirros uec

This adds a horizon_listen_port option, which defaults to horizon_port
for backward compatibility.

This option allow the user to differentiate between the port the
service listens on, and the port the service is reachable on. This is
useful for external load balancers which live on the same host as the

This is necessary if you'd like to secure RabbitMQ traffic. The HAProxy
solution has a number of disadvantages, and RabbitMQ/erlang are very
good at providing native TLS/SSL.

The options for CA certs and keys and such can be handled in
inventory/globals/passwords. By default this will do nothing and users
who want TLS/SSL for their RabbitMQ can do so via HAProxy.

We need to specify doc requirements in doc/requirements.txt
to avoid problems with the pip resolver [1] for the release team [2][3].
Removing specific doc requirements from test-requirements.txt.

The problem here is that this repos haven't doc/requirements.txt file
and by default in this case zuul will use the test-requirements.txt file
to pull requirements [4].

This requirements file contains extra requirements like flake8 that
collided with those allowed in our job environment and so the new pip
resolver fails to install these requirements and the job exits in error.

This project meet the conditions leading to the bug.

/!\/!\/!\
Notice that I voluntarily added the doc directory even if no docs
are generated here because zuul will try to pull this requirements from
there first and the contained requirements are needed for reno but AFAIK
the releasenotes dir is ignored by zuul. c.f [4] for further details.

been made to openstack-ansible, this patch documents these
changes. Hopefully the level of the documentation gives the users
enough background on what the changes are and how to use them,
without going into the detailed specifics of each feature.

Regarding the upgrade to TLS for haproxy internal VIP and backends
in existing deployments, I have some ideas on how this could be
done without causing downtime but have not had chance to test
this yet. The idea is to use a TCP frontend that accepts both
HTTP and HTTPS traffic and redirects to correct frontend for each.

This is a subordinate charm and since a recent
commit [1] it shares a list of its services with
the principal charm nova-compute, which has now
the responsibility to pause and resume services. [2]

The ceilometer-agent-compute service has a
dependency to the nova-compute service anyway, so
it is impossible for this charm to resume its
service if its principal charm nova-compute is
paused. This is what also led to errors in
ceilometer-agent's post-series-upgrade hook. This
hook attempted to resume its service although
the principal service was still paused. Removing
this logic entirely solves this issue.

Validated by running openstack-upgrade and
series-upgrade tests. [3]

As described in related-bug, this allows us to override the install

attempt with [1] which added the ability to override the target hash.

As commented in the bug (see comment #7) we need to override both target
and install versions. Since this is nested bash/jinja/python :/ we do this
by passing the content provider branches as a string
""branch1:hash1;branch2:hash2"" generated in the jinja templating
which is then decoded on the emit-releases python side.

The mock third party library was needed for mock support in py2

standard lib unittest.mock module instead.

Note that https://github.com/openstack/charms.openstack is used during tests
and he need `mock`, unfortunatelly it doesn't declare `mock` in its
requirements so it retrieve mock from other charm project (cross dependency).

This technique was borrowed from the tox ""cover"" environment in
openstack/nova's tox.ini.  This leverages the fact that stestr lets
you override the python executable via the PYTHON environment
variable.  Doing this allows us to easily generate coverage for our
unit tests.

An important caveat is that this does not provide any coverage for
tests via zaza, amulet, etc.  It is purely focused on the unit tests.

Note that this replaces the previous .coveragerc; coverage
configuration is instead pulled from tox.ini.

In order to test deployment on EL9, we need to prepare
the node.

The current nodepool image has centos.repo which pulls
packages from CentOS mirror. But it is not always in good
shape and it blocks the CI work.

This patch enables compose repos in the pre playbook.
It will help to move the deployment ahead.

It moves dlrn repos generation with in conditionals to avoid
breaking containers and images job.
